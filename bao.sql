The critter was believed to have lived among dinosaurs some 113 million years ago — several millennia before previously found ants, according to new research.\n\n“I was just shocked to see that weird projection in front of this (insect’s) head,” Lepeco said. “Other hell ants have been described with odd mandibles, but always as amber specimens.”\n\nAt wildlife conservancies in Africa, four-legged friends are invigorating efforts to combat poaching.\n\nProfessional dog trainers Darren Priddle and Jacqui Law of Carmarthen, Wales, spearhead the initiative, called Dogs4Wildlife.

A worm wriggled at its feet. The bird appeared to probe the silty earth with its beak, once, twice, three times, looking for food. On the fourth try, the bird may have found something. Or perhaps it missed again and moved on.\n\nThis glimpse into prehistory is possible thanks to two tiny fossil footprints and the dogged work of an undergraduate intern at John Day Fossil Beds National Monument with a particular interest in ancient tracks, known as trace fossils.\n\n“Trace fossils definitely do tell stories,” said Conner Bennett, lead author of a study describing the find and three others that was published in February in the journal Palaeontologia Electronica. “We don’t have the body of this bird. It’s more just like we’re left with its actions, its behaviors. It’s like trying to study ghosts.”\n\nTrace fossils can fill in gaps in the fossil record, said Dr. Anthony Martin, professor of practice in the department of environmental sciences at Emory University in Atlanta. “This paper has tracks that are definitely from a bird of some sort, and then tracks that are definitely from a lizard,” said Martin, who researches modern and fossil traces and was not involved in the research. “So those are showing that those animals actually were there, even though there’s not a single bone or feather or any other bodily evidence of those two types of animals being there.”\n\nThe science of trace fossils isn’t as “sexy” as studying bones, teeth and other physical remains, Bennett said. Fossilized tracks don’t get as much attention. That’s part of the reason he got the chance to undertake this research in the first place. Bennett, now a graduate student in the department of Earth, environmental and planetary sciences at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, applied for a summer internship at John Day in 2022. The national monument holds a rich paleontological record from the Eocene Epoch — part of the age of mammals — which lasted from about 56 million to 34 million years ago.\n\nBennett combed through the park’s online catalog of finds and came across several animal track impressions that had been found decades ago but never studied. He’d previously worked with 3D modeling software to describe dinosaur tracks and endeavored to give the unidentified animal tracks the same treatment.\n\nThe analysis could help researchers form a better understanding of the prehistoric ecosystems of Oregon. Bennett said he hopes his findings will inspire other researchers to look for trace clues they may have previously overlooked. “I’m sure it’s going to happen soon where people are like, ‘Oh, it’s really interesting to learn about fossil tracks. Let’s pull this stuff out of our archives and start looking at it.”\n\nWhile interning at John Day, Bennett took hundreds of overlapping photos of four sets of fossilized tracks, each only centimeters in size. He fed the pictures into the modeling software, which created 3D representations that could be blown up, zoomed in on and scrutinized in greater detail than the fossils.\n\nIn one, there were tracks that reminded him of a small shorebird, such as a plover. There aren’t bird fossils in John Day, he explained — the bones are fragile and hollow and don’t hold up well. But it would make sense that there would be such birds near the lake that once covered the area where the tracks were excavated.\n\nThere were also small, round indentations near the tracks. At first, Bennett and study coauthor Dr. Nicholas A. Famoso — the head paleontologist and museum curator at John Day — thought they could be caused by raindrops, which can leave impressions in the fine grains of shale and clay the tracks were found in. But there are usually many raindrop impressions, and here there were only a few, and only near the footprints. The researchers wondered whether the bird had made them with its beak. Bennett went online and quickly turned up a video of modern plovers pecking into the ground, hunting for food. The connection seemed clear to the research team.\n\nNot only did the trace fossil confirm the previously unproved existence of birds in the area tens of millions of years ago, but it also could paint a picture of how the birds foraged in the shallow water — much the way they do today. And to complete the picture, the fossil contained evidence of what the bird was feeding on or trying to feed on: the squiggly trail of a worm on the move. “We can track a feeding behavior over 50 million years. That’s pretty cool,” Bennett said.\n\nDr. Danielle Fraser, head of paleobiology at the Canadian Museum of Nature in Ottawa, who was not involved in this study, expressed a similar sentiment. “This is a really cool example of a behavior that would otherwise not be apparent,” she said.\n\nMartin suggested an alternative interpretation: that the divots could have been made by water droplets falling off the bird’s body as it came out of the water. “I’ve seen that a lot on the Georgia coast,” he noted.\n\nA separate specimen showed three footprints made up of five thin, splayed digits and clawlike impressions, suggesting some small lizard once darted along the lakeshore. There were even marks showing where the lizard dragged its feet. The researchers found this exciting because there are few examples of tracks from small lizards in North America in this period, and no body fossils have been unearthed at John Day.\n\n“Too few paleontologists are trained in the recognition and interpretation of trace fossils and so a lot of this information is overlooked,” said study coauthor Dr. Daniel I. Hembree, professor and director of undergraduate geology studies in the University of Tennessee department where Bennett is studying.\n\nThe traces are the only evidence of small lizards’ existence at John Day during the Eocene.\n\n“The fossils of the bird and lizard are the first evidence of those groups of animals from that period of time in our fossil record,” Famoso said. They “help to paint a more complete picture of what life was like” during the Eocene.\n\nBennett also analyzed two other trace fossils — from mammals from a more recent time period. One showed prints of a three-toed ungulate, possibly a rhinoceros or ancient tapir. The other: the 29 million-year-old tracks from what the researchers believe to be some sort of saber-toothed cat.\n\nThe absence of claw marks suggested that the animal’s claws were retractable, like those of modern cats. And the gait appears similar, too, Martin said. The way the rear paw print only partially overlaps the front means the animal may have been walking at a normal pace. “This is the kind of understep gait that I see in my cats at home,” he said. “I get kind of excited when I see something that looks so familiar.”\n\nFamoso noted that both sets of prints were found in an ash layer, which means the animals walked across an ash-laden landscape after a volcanic eruption.\n\n“Sometimes fossils are stored in collections until new technologies or methods are developed that can better study them,” he added. “These fossils were collected and added to collections between 1979 and 1987, but it took until 2022 for us to get a good study out to describe the specimens.”', 'A closer look at fossil tracks', 'Updated 10:18 AM EDT, Fri April 25, 2025', 'fossilized-footprints-reveal-unprecedented-insight-into-prehistoric-animal-behavior-in-oregon-1745765218'),

Mom and dad had been on the rooftop for awhile, but their five goslings — who were too young to fly — had no way to follow their parents down to a nearby pond, four stories below.\n\nMichael Waters, a longtime volunteer with AWARE Wildlife Center, came to the rescue. Even as an experienced wildlife rescuer, Waters said saving the geese was tricky due to their behavior and strong gusts of wind.\n\n“There were five little goslings, and they were all running in a fright,” Waters said. “The mother and father goose were both present and they both were sort of in their guardian mode and were being very protective.”\n\nThe goal of the rescue, Waters said, was to collect the entire family to keep them together and relocate them to a pond below.\n\n“The first thing I thought was to collect the little ones because I was just so concerned about them at the precarity of the ledge,” he said.\n\nAfter Waters collected the goslings in a box, he tried to capture the father goose.\n\n“He fought me off of his wing and flew off the building,” Waters said. “He flew all the way down to the ground and was just honking like a little horror at the base of the building.”\n\nNext, Waters tried to save the mother goose, but he realized she was also trying to escape. To prevent her from leaving, Waters released all the goslings, and she came after him trying to protect her babies.\n\n“I was able to secure her in her enclosure, then I was able to collect all the babies again,” Waters said.\n\nWith the goslings and the mother goose captured, Waters took them outside to release them in the pond.\n\n“Who was waiting there at the pond but the father goose!” Waters said. “So, it was just perfect.”\n\nWhile the rooftop goslings had never been on the ground or in water before, Waters said they adjusted quickly.\n\n“It was so lovely to see their little instincts step forward,” he said. “They immediately became amphibious and just waddled out and went out with mom and dad, and they all went to go live their wild lives.”\n\nBut how did the geese get themselves into this situation? Why would they want to nest on a hotel rooftop?\n\nKara Nitschke, migratory and game bird biologist with the Georgia Department of Natural Resources, said Canada geese are very adaptable and easily assimilate.\n\n“In urban and suburban areas, we keep our grass short like golf courses, parks, neighborhoods,” Nitschke said. “Geese like that because they can walk through that easily.”\n\nAnd she said it’s a “bonus” for the geese if these green spaces have a nearby pond.\n\n“They can run to the water and hop in (if they feel threatened), and they feel perfectly safe and comfy,” she said.\n\nThe state of Georgia is home to about 250,000 Canada geese, according to Nitschke. Being a migratory species, the birds would make their yearly trip south from Canada. But in the 1970s and ’80s when migration slowed, Nitschke said the state stocked the environment with around 8,000 geese — and since then, the population has boomed.\n\nCanada geese are federally protected under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918. That means if someone comes across an injured or orphaned goose or wants to relocate a goose, that person would need a permit to handle it, Nitschke said.\n\nIf anyone finds a goose or any wildlife that might need help, Nitschke and Waters recommend they call their state wildlife department or a local wildlife rehabilitation center, like Atlanta’s AWARE, before interacting with the animal.\n\nFor Waters, who regularly works with and rescues animals, idealism keeps him motivated to continue his work.\n\n“In any way that we can ameliorate or make better the effects that have consequences for these other beings,” Waters said, “I want to be someone who gives at least the effort for things to be made better.”', '', 'Published 10:00 AM EDT, Fri April 25, 2025', 'feathered-family-stuck-on-a-rooftop-gets-a-fairytale-ending-1745765218'),

We must not lose our competitive edge.”\n\nThe federal agency announced earlier this month that it would cancel hundreds of grants totaling more than $230 million. The terminations included — but were not limited to — research related to “diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) and misinformation/disinformation,” according to information released by the NSF.\n\nThe Trump administration issued a series of executive orders earlier this year demanding federal agencies cease activities related to promoting DEI.\n\nThe canceled grants included those titled with phrases such as “Racial Equity in STEM,” “Antiracist Teacher Leadership” and “Advancing Gender Equity in Computing.”\n\nBut the list also included other topics, such as the “Spread of Unsubstantiated Information” and “Addressing Vaccine Information Integrity.”\n\nIn a post about the canceled grants, the NSF said that the misinformation research funding was halted to comply with Trump’s January 20 executive order on “restoring freedom of speech.”\n\nThe agency said it does “not support research with the goal of combating ‘misinformation,’ ‘disinformation,’ and ‘malinformation’ that could be used to infringe on the constitutionally protected speech rights of American citizens across the United States in a manner that advances a preferred narrative about significant matters of public debate.”\n\nThe changes have prompted backlash from various research organizations and stakeholders.\n\nIn response to the executive orders and other internal changes at NSF, some of which have taken place since DOGE arrived in mid-April, researchers have been asked to ensure funding requests comply with shifting directives.\n\nThat guidance has put scientists in the “middle of a political tug-of-war, wasting valuable time and resources,” according to an April 24 statement from the Federation of Associations in Behavioral & Brain Sciences.\n\n“NSF has a tested process for evaluating the intellectual merit and the broader impact of proposed investigations and FABBS encourages NSF to honor it,” the federation’s statement reads.\n\nThe National Science Foundation may also face sweeping cuts to its roughly 1,500-person workforce, echoing how DOGE has demanded a reduction in force, or RIF, across numerous federal agencies.\n\nThe NSF was established in 1950 and is tasked with evaluating the scientific merit of grant requests and doling out dollars — mostly to universities and other research institutions — to advance scientists’ understanding of a wide range of topics, including artificial intelligence and the fundamental workings of the cosmos.', 'Canceled grants to slash spending', 'Updated 8:09 PM EDT, Thu April 24, 2025', 'trumps-firstterm-pick-to-run-the-national-science-foundation-quits-i-have-done-all-i-can-1745765218'),

Anderson Lepeco, a researcher at the Museum of Zoology of the University of São Paulo, said he came across the “extraordinary” specimen in September 2024 while examining a fossil collection housed at the Museum of Zoology of the University of São Paulo.\n\nThe museum has one of the world’s largest collections of fossilized insects and contains specimens from northeastern Brazil’s Crato Formation, a geological deposit renowned for its exceptional fossil preservation.\n\nPreserved in limestone, the newly described extinct insect is what’s known as a hell ant, a member of a subfamily called Haidomyrmecinae that lived during the Cretaceous period between 66 million and 45 million years ago and is not related to any ant alive today, according to a study published Thursday in the journal Current Biology. The fossil species, which has been named Vulcanidris cratensis, had scythe-like jaws that it likely used to pin or impale prey.\n\n“I was just shocked to see that weird projection in front of this (insect’s) head,” Lepeco, the study’s lead author, said. “Other hell ants have been described with odd mandibles, but always as amber specimens.”\n\nIt’s rare to find insects preserved in rock. Other hell ants from the Cretaceous have been found entombed in amber from France and Myanmar but they date back to around 99 million years ago. That a hell ant lived before that in what’s now Brazil means ants were already widely distributed across the planet at an early point in their evolution, the study authors noted.\n\nThe discovery sheds light on how ants evolved during the early Cretaceous, a time of significant change. It also offers some insight into unusual features in ant species of this period that didn’t survive the mass extinction that ended the dinosaur era, the researchers said.\n\nToday, ants are one of the most conspicuous and abundant groups of insects on the planet, found on all continents except Antarctica, the study noted.\n\nHowever, ants haven’t always been dominant. They evolved during the late Jurassic and early Cretaceous, roughly 145 million years ago, when ant ancestors diverged from the same group that would give rise to wasps and bees.\n\nIt wasn’t until after an asteroid strike doomed the dinosaurs and other species to extinction 66 million years ago that ants became the most common insect found in the fossil record, according to the study.\n\nThe fossil is a “pretty big deal,” said Phil Barden, an associate professor at the New Jersey Institute of Technology who studies the evolutionary history of insects.\n\n“This new find now represents the oldest ant known, it extends the known fossil record for ants by about ten million years,” Barden, who wasn’t involved in the study, said via email.\n\n“Although fossil ants have been described since the 19th century…Until now, it was not clear if the absence of ants older than 100 million years was because they were not around or just that they were not preserved in deposits where people were looking,” he added.\n\nThe newly identified species also had some wasp-like characteristics indicative of the common ancestry between the two creatures. For example, the ant’s wings had far more veins than those of living ants, Lepeco said.\n\nMicro-computed tomography imaging — a 3D-imaging technique that employs X-rays to view inside the ant — revealed that the bug was closely related to hell ants previously known only from Burmese amber fossils.\n\nWhat was most striking about the ant was its unusual anatomical features. Modern ants have jaws that grasp laterally — side to side. However, this ant possessed scythe-like jaws that ran parallel to its head and projected forward from near the eyes, the researchers noted in the study.\n\n“It could have worked as a kind of forklift, moving upwards” as the ant preyed on other extinct insects, Lepeco explained via email.\n\n“The intricate morphology suggests that even these earliest ants had already evolved sophisticated predatory strategies significantly different from their modern counterparts,” Lepeco added.', 'Anatomical features lost to time', 'Published 2:39 PM EDT, Thu April 24, 2025', 'extraordinary-fossil-reveals-the-oldest-ant-species-known-to-science-1745765218'),

Last year, Pakistan sent a satellite to the Moon aboard China’s lunar explorer, alongside payloads from the European Space Agency, France, and Italy, according to Chinese state media.\n\nTiangong is one of two currently operating space stations, alongside the International Space Station, launched in 1998.

The man died and was buried in a grave between 1,825 and 1,725 years ago in an area now known as York, England. The study was published Wednesday in the journal PLOS One.\n\nArchaeologists with the York Archaeological Trust recovered the remains from Driffield Terrace, which they consider to be a gladiator graveyard.\n\nThe spot sits along the old Roman road leading out of York and got its graveyard designation after archaeologists announced the discovery of 82 skeletons of able-bodied young men in a 2010 documentary called “Gladiators: Back From the Dead.”\n\nWhile the Romans documented fights between humans as well as humans and animals in artwork and records, the physical evidence of gladiators and the battles they faced for the sake of entertaining others is scarce, the study authors said.\n\n“For years, our understanding of Roman gladiatorial combat and animal spectacles has relied heavily on historical texts and artistic depictions,” said lead study author Tim Thompson, a professor of anthropology and vice president for students and learning at Maynooth University in Ireland, in a statement. “This discovery provides the first direct, physical evidence that such events took place in this period, reshaping our perception of Roman entertainment culture in the region.”\n\nThe findings highlight the wide-ranging effects of the Roman Empire across England, showing that gladiator arenas that featured animals imported from other countries were part of the culture and lifestyle far from the reaches of the Colosseum in Rome.\n\nBurials didn’t take place within settlements during the Roman period, leading the dead to be cremated or buried alongside major roads, the authors said in the study.\n\nWhen construction in the area led to archaeological evaluations in 2004, researchers uncovered the Driffield Terrace cemetery. Many of the men’s remains carried evidence of training, trauma, healed injuries and unusual funeral rites such as decapitation. Analysis of tooth enamel also showed the men came from a broad range of Roman provinces from around the world.\n\nWhile researchers have carried out extensive studies on the cemetery and its remains, a mystery lingered: a skeleton with unexplained depressions on the pelvis that resembled bites from a carnivore.\n\nAs part of the new study, the researchers created three-dimensional scans of the markings and compared them with bites from various carnivores. The comparison showed the bite marks likely came from a large cat, most likely a lion.\n\n“The bite marks were likely made by a lion, which confirms that the skeletons buried at the cemetery were gladiators, rather than soldiers or slaves, as initially thought and represent the first osteological confirmation of human interaction with large carnivores in a combat or entertainment setting in the Roman world,” said study coauthor Malin Holst, lecturer in osteoarchaeology at the University of York’s department of archaeology, in a statement. Holst is also the managing director of York Osteoarchaeology, which specializes in the excavation, analysis and reporting of human remains.\n\nSurviving texts and artwork demonstrate that such encounters between men and beasts were staged during arena spectacles in the Roman Empire, said Kathleen M. Coleman, James Loeb Professor of the Classics at Harvard University. Coleman was not involved in the research.\n\n“But images can travel to areas where the events themselves do not take place, so on their own they are not conclusive evidence that animal combat took place there,” Coleman said. “That is why the new skeleton is so important.”\n\nAdditional analysis of the man’s bones showed he recovered from malnutrition as a child but had spinal issues due to overloading his back and inflammation of his lungs and thighs.\n\nThe man was likely a bestarius, or a gladiator that went up against beasts, and whose role was filled by volunteers or slaves.\n\n“(Gladiators) could become famous and could buy their freedom, so we have a better understanding now of the complex social world they inhabited,” said Barry Molloy, an associate professor in the school of archaeology at University College Dublin, who was not involved in the study. “What we see in art might be considered to be ‘the money shots’ or what we might imagine the Romans viewed as the ‘coolest kills’ that the patron of the art wanted to show their audience. You can imagine in the arena, with an armed person fighting for their life, the winner of human vs. animal battles was not a foregone conclusion.”\n\nGladiators were viewed as athletes at the time, and their owners wanted them to win so they would be able to fight again, the study authors said. The lion bite never healed, which suggests it led to or caused his death, and the man was decapitated after death. While this was a funeral rite for some in the Roman period, the researchers think the man was decapitated as a mercy killing after the lion bite.\n\n“This is a hugely exciting find because we can now start to build a better image of what these gladiators were like in life, and it also confirms the presence of large cats, and potentially other exotic animals, in arenas in cities such as York, and how they too had to defend themselves from the threat of death,” Malin said.\n\nBut how did a gladiator arena, and a lion, end up in northeast England?\n\nImages of sparring gladiators, sometimes with one another or with beasts, memorialized in ancient mosaics and pottery recall the Roman Colosseum, “which would have been the classical world’s Wembley Stadium of combat,” said David Jennings, CEO of York Archaeology and a doctoral researcher in the department of archaeology at University of York. Jennings did not participate in the new research.\n\nBut such brutal sporting events had an extensive reach beyond the core Roman territories, and while an amphitheater likely existed in Roman York, it hasn’t been discovered yet, Malin said.\n\nYork began as the Roman city of Eboracum, which was founded as a fortress in the year 71 AD, and soldiers remained there until the end of the Roman period in the early fifth century, according to the study authors. Researchers think gladiator-style arena events were occurring there as late as the fourth century because the city hosted many senior generals and politicians, as well as Constantine, who was proclaimed emperor by his troops in Eboracum in AD 306.\n\nThe new findings indicate that Britain was well integrated into the customs and systems of the Roman Empire at its peak and provide evidence that Roman entertainments were widespread across the empire, said Jaclyn Neel, an associate professor of Greek and Roman studies at Carleton University in Ottawa. Neel was not involved in the research.\n\nBut the presence of lions, rather than local wild boar and deer, in York provided a unique twist for the researchers. Mosaics, such as the “Corridor of the Great Hunt” located in the UNESCO World Heritage Site of Villa Romana del Casale in Piazza Armerina, Sicily, depict how large animals were captured and transported to Rome for sport.\n\n“The exact context for this encounter might have been a contest between a professional beast-fighter and the lion, which would have been exciting for the spectators, who might even have laid bets as to who would win,” Coleman said. “Or it could have been a form of execution in which a criminal is exposed to wild animals, in which case presumably the spectators would enjoy the satisfaction of seeing justice being done, since a criminal would not elicit any pity.”\n\nThe lion was likely transported along well-established supply routes that also carried bulk supplies of wine, oil and grain across continental Europe and the Mediterranean to York given that it was a legionary base, said study coauthor Dr. John Pearce, reader in archaeology and classics at King’s College London. Big cats like lions would have been captured in northern Africa, then transported across the sea before being moved across a network of rivers and eventually the road from London to York.\n\n“As tangible witnesses to spectacles in Britain’s Roman amphitheatres, the bitemarks help us appreciate these spaces as settings for brutal demonstrations of power. They make an important contribution to desanitizing our Roman past,” Pearce said in a statement.\n\nIf the man who faced the lion was a professional hunter, as indicated in the study, the entertainment of watching human and a lion interact in the arena was probably more like bullfighting in Spain, Neel said.\n\n“I do think it’s important to not exoticize the Romans — they were much more familiar with death than most modern North Americans, but that doesn’t mean that they tried to kill as many people as possible,” she said. “Roman culture emphasized the control of man over nature. A beast hunt, to me, is a theatrical re-enactment of that control. Romans thus used the beast hunts to reinforce a sense of human superiority over nature, even for the spectators.”\n\nThe skeleton will be part of the Roman exhibition “DIG: An Archaeological Adventure in St. Saviorugate” in York, while a 3D scan of the bite mark and other depictions of gladiatorial fights in Britain are part of the traveling “Gladiators of Britain,” a British Museum partnership exhibition currently on display at the Dorset Museum & Art Gallery.', 'Revisiting a puzzling find', 'Updated 2:36 PM EDT, Wed April 23, 2025', 'a-bite-from-a-lion-likely-led-to-the-demise-of-a-gladiator-new-research-finds-1745765218');

Scientists say they now know why', 'https://edition.cnn.com/2025/04/23/science/terror-crocodile-dinosaur-eating-saltwater/index.html', '', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/deinosuchus-walter-et-al-commsbio.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_833,w_1480,c_fill', 'An artist\'s illustration shows Deinosuchus riograndensis swimming with an early alligator relative in the wetlands of the Western Interior Seaway in southwestern North America, during the Late Cretaceous.', '(CNN) — A massive, extinct reptile that once snacked on dinosaurs had a broad snout like an alligator’s, but it owed its success to a trait that modern alligators lack: tolerance for salt water.\n\nDeinosuchus was one of the largest crocodilians that ever lived, with a body nearly as long as a bus and teeth the size of bananas. From about 82 million to 75 million years ago, the top predator swam in rivers and estuaries of North America. The skull was wide and long, tipped with a bulbous lump that was unlike any skull structure seen in other crocodilians. Toothmarks on Cretaceous bones hint that Deinosuchus hunted or scavenged dinosaurs.\n\nDespite its scientific name, which translates as “terror crocodile,” Deinosuchus has commonly been called a “greater alligator,” and prior assessments of its evolutionary relationships grouped it with alligators and their ancient relatives. However, a new analysis of fossils, along with DNA from living crocodilians such as alligators and crocodiles, suggests Deinosuchus belongs on a different part of the crocodilian family tree.\n\nUnlike alligatoroids, Deinosuchus retained the salt glands of ancestral crocodilians, enabling it to tolerate salt water, scientists reported Wednesday in the journal Communications Biology. Modern crocodiles have these glands, which collect and release excess sodium chloride.\n\nSalt tolerance would have helped Deinosuchus navigate the Western Interior Seaway that once divided North America, during a greenhouse phase marked by global sea level rise. Deinosuchus could then have spread across the continent to inhabit coastal marshes on both sides of the ancient inland sea, and along North America’s Atlantic coast.\n\nThe new study’s revised family tree for crocodilians offers fresh insights into climate resilience in the group, and hints at how some species adapted to environmental cooling while others went extinct.\n\nWith salt glands allowing Deinosuchus to travel where its alligatoroid cousins couldn’t, the terror crocodile settled in habitats teeming with large prey. Deinosuchus evolved to become an enormous and widespread predator that dominated marshy ecosystems, where it fed on pretty much whatever it wanted.\n\n“No one was safe in these wetlands when Deinosuchus was around,” said senior study author Dr. Márton Rabi, a lecturer in the Institute of Geosciences at the University of Tübingen in Germany. “We are talking about an absolutely monstrous animal,” Rabi told CNN. “Definitely around 8 meters (26 feet) or more total body length.”\n\nSince the mid-19th century, fossils of Deinosuchus have been found on both sides of the ancient seaway and belong to at least two species. The largest of these, Deinosuchus riograndensis, lived on the western side, along the east coast of an island called Laramidia. Bordered on the west by the Pacific Ocean, Laramidia made up less than one-third of the landmass of North America. The continent’s other island portion was known as Appalachia.\n\nWhile Deinosuchus had long been classified as an alligator relative, its distribution on both sides of this vast seaway was an unsolved puzzle. If it was an alligatoroid — a group that today lives only in freshwater — how could Deinosuchus cross a sea spanning more than 620 miles (1,000 kilometers)? One hypothesis suggested that early alligators were saltwater tolerant and then later lost the trait. But that interpretation didn’t have much evidence to back it up; it hinged solely on Deinosuchus being included in the alligatoroid group, Rabi explained.\n\nAnother possible explanation was that Deinosuchus dispersed across North America before the Western Interior Seaway formed and divided western and eastern populations. However, the fossil record doesn’t back that up. The seaway appeared about 100 million years ago, making it approximately 20 million years older than the earliest known Deinosuchus fossils.\n\n“The picture wasn’t very coherent,” Rabi said.\n\nFor the new analysis, the researchers incorporated data from extinct crocodilians that were not sampled for the group’s earlier family trees. These “missing links” helped the team connect species that were not previously recognized to be related and reassemble the order in which certain traits emerged in the group.\n\n“Our analysis found that saltwater tolerance is a fairly ancient trait of many crocodilians, and was secondarily lost in the alligatoroids,” Rabi said. Having even a moderate tolerance for salt would have greatly benefited ancient crocodile relatives as climate shifts reshaped their habitats, said Dr. Evon Hekkala, a professor and chair of the department of biological sciences at Fordham University in New York City.\n\n“This ecological trait would have allowed lineages of crocodiles in the past to be more opportunistic in times when drastic environmental changes, such as sea level rise, were causing extinctions in less tolerant species,” said Hekkala, who was not involved in the study.\n\nThe researchers also constructed a new crocodilian family tree using molecular data from modern crocodilians to clarify features shared by all alligatoroids. The earliest alligators were far smaller than other crocodilians that lived at the same time, the team found. Alligators began to evolve the larger body sizes seen today about 34 million years ago, after the climate cooled and their competition went extinct. But when alligatoroids first appeared, Deinosuchus would have been an outlier due to its massive bulk, according to the new study.\n\nDwarfism in early alligatoroids was another clue that giant Deinosuchus was no “greater alligator,” and it likely diverged into a different branch of the family tree before alligatoroids evolved, Rabi said.\n\nThe study’s approach — combining a new molecular tree with morphology, or analysis of body and skull shapes in crocodilians — paints a clearer picture of how Deinosuchus evolved, Hekkala said. Shifting Deinosuchus away from alligatoroids “fits much better with our current understanding of ecological flexibility among the extinct and living crocodiles,” she added. “This new paper really reaches into both the evolutionary and ecological role of this amazing animal.”\n\nWhile Deinosuchus was one of the largest crocodilians, it wasn’t the only giant. Massive crocodilians evolved independently in aquatic environments more than a dozen times over the past 120 million years during all types of global climatic phases — including ice ages, according to the study. Even in living species, reports of individuals measuring 23 feet (7 meters) or more persisted until the 19th century, suggesting enormous Deinosuchus was the rule rather than the exception.\n\n“Giant crocs are more like the norm — of any time,” Rabi said.', 'An outlier among alligators', 'Updated 9:24 AM EDT, Wed April 23, 2025', 'an-ancient-terror-crocodile-became-a-dinosaureating-giant-scientists-say-they-now-know-why-1745765218'),

In a perfectly dark sky, onlookers can typically spot up to 18 meteors per hour during the Lyrid shower’s peak. This year, however, light from the waning crescent moon will make it somewhat harder to see the celestial show.\n\nStill, local weather conditions allowing, careful observers in the Northern Hemisphere can expect around five streaking lights per hour appearing between 10 p.m. local time Monday and 4:30 a.m. Tuesday, said Dr. Bill Cooke, lead for NASA’s Meteoroid Environment Office.\n\n“Most meteors you see (during a Lyrid shower) are not brilliant fireballs — they are faint little streaks — and the more moonlight there is, it tends to wash out those faint little streaks,” Cooke said. “Meteor observing is one of those things where you’re going to take your time.”\n\nFor the optimal viewing experience, Cooke recommends lying down somewhere outside with minimal light pollution and giving your eyes about 30 minutes to adjust to the darkness.\n\n“The other important thing is: Don’t look at your cell phone, because that bright screen destroys your night vision,” Cooke said. “And it takes your eyes off the sky.”\n\nRegular meteor showers occur throughout the year as the Earth passes through a field of debris left by comets and asteroids, said Shannon Schmoll, director of Abrams Planetarium at Michigan State University.\n\nThe Lyrids originate from the parent comet C/1861 G1 (Thatcher), which is about halfway through its roughly 415-year orbit around the sun. While Comet Thatcher was discovered in 1861, the Lyrids have been observed for 2,700 years, making them one of the oldest known meteor showers, according to NASA.\n\nThe best time to view the Lyrids is when Lyra, the Northern Hemisphere constellation from which the meteors appear to radiate, is above the horizon, according to EarthSky.\n\nAs the comet travels, it leaves a trail of ice and dust moving thousands of miles per hour in its wake, astronomer Dean Regas said.\n\n“The meteors hit the (Earth’s) atmosphere and slow down, and that transmits heat. That’s the flash you see,” Regas said. “Most of the material from meter showers, the comet pieces, will burn up before they hit the ground, and a lot of them are about the size of a grain of sand. So it’s really impressive to see something so small light up like that.”\n\nWhile the Lyrids tend to be relatively predictable each year, occasionally they exceed expectations.\n\nOutbursts of 100 meteors per hour occur unpredictably, averaging about every 60 years. The next outburst is expected around 2042, according to the American Meteor Society. It is not entirely known what causes these outbursts, but other planets and objects are thought to affect the density of the debris as they cross paths, Schmoll said.\n\nIf you miss the peak of the Lyrid shower, there’s still a chance to catch some shooting stars this year.\n\nHere are peak dates for upcoming meteor showers in 2025, according to the American Meteor Society and EarthSky.\n\n● Eta Aquariids: May 5–6\n\n● Southern Delta Aquariids: July 29–30\n\n● Alpha Capricornids: July 29–30\n\n● Perseids: August 12–13\n\n● Draconids: October 8–9\n\n● Orionids: October 22–23\n\n● Southern Taurids: November 3–4\n\n● Northern Taurids: November 8–9\n\n● Leonids: November 16–17\n\n● Geminids: December 12–13\n\n● Ursids: December 21–22\n\nFollowing the recent pink moon event, there are eight more full moons to look out for this year, with supermoons occurring in October, November and December.\n\nHere’s the list of full moons remaining in 2025, according to the Farmers’ Almanac:\n\n● May 12: Flower moon\n\n● June 11: Strawberry moon\n\n● July 10: Buck moon\n\n● August 9: Sturgeon moon\n\n● September 7: Corn moon\n\n● October 6: Harvest moon\n\n● November 5: Beaver moon\n\n● December 4: Cold moon\n\nIn the lead-up to the fall season, two eclipse events will grace the sky.\n\nA total lunar eclipse will be most visible from Europe, Africa, Asia, Australia, parts of eastern South America, Alaska and Antarctica on September 7 and 8. A lunar eclipse, which causes the moon to look dark or dimmed, occurs when Earth is between the sun and moon and the three celestial objects line up in a row so that the moon passes into our planet’s shadow.\n\nWhen the moon is within the darkest part of Earth’s shadow, called the umbra, it takes on a reddish hue, which has led to the nickname “blood moon” for a lunar eclipse, according to NASA. That shadow isn’t perfect, so sunbeams sneak around the shadow’s edges, bathing the moon in warm hues.\n\nA partial solar eclipse will occur on September 21 as the moon moves between the sun and Earth but the celestial bodies aren’t perfectly aligned, according to NASA. In this type of event, the moon only blocks part of the sun’s face, creating a crescent shape in which it appears the moon is taking a “bite” out of the sun. This event will be visible to parts of Australia, Antarctica and the Pacific Ocean.', 'More about the Lyrids', 'Updated 11:32 AM EDT, Mon April 21, 2025', 'how-and-when-to-watch-the-lyrid-meteor-shower-1745765218'),

But the act would have dire consequences beyond his own well-being.\n\nThe year was 1924, and Midgley, then a chemical engineer for General Motors, had pulled the stunt to support his most recent, lucrative finding: a lead compound called tetraethyl lead. Added to gasoline, it solved one of the biggest problems the automotive industry faced at the time — engine knocking, or tiny explosions in car engines due to the low quality of gasoline that resulted in an annoying sound and potential damage. Lead helped, but at great expense, because the substance is highly toxic to humans, especially children.\n\nMidgley would go on to leave his mark in history with another destructive invention, also a solution to a problem: the need to replace the noxious and flammable gases used in refrigeration and air conditioning. He found that CFCs, or chlorofluorocarbons, were an ideal substitute and harmless to humans. However, they turned out to be deadly to the ozone in the atmosphere, which blocks dangerous ultraviolet radiation that can cause skin cancers and other health problems, as well as harming plants and animals.\n\nOne hundred years after that stunt before the press in 1924, the planet is still recovering from the ill effects of both of Midgley’s inventions. The ozone layer will need another four decades to heal fully, and because leaded gasoline was still sold in parts of the world until 2021, many continue to live with the long-term effects of lead poisoning.\n\nYet Midgley — whose story will be told in an upcoming movie developed by the writer of the 2013 film “The Wolf of Wall Street” — was hailed as a hero for decades.\n\nBorn in Beaver Falls, Pennsylvania, in 1889, Midgley had a penchant for finding useful applications for known substances early on. In high school, he used the chewed bark of the slippery elm trees to give baseballs a more curved trajectory, a practice professional players would later pick up.\n\nHe was known to carry with him at all times a copy of the periodic table, his main tool in the search for the substance that would mark his breakthrough invention.\n\nThe task of addressing the issue of engine knocking fell to Midgley while he was working at General Motors in 1916.\n\n“It was the dawn of the automobile era in the United States, and Ford had developed the Model T, which was not very powerful,” said Gerald Markowitz, a history professor at the City University of New York. “GM joined with Standard Oil and DuPont to try to develop more powerful engines, and in order to do that they needed to solve the problem of the engines knocking with the fuel that they had at the time.”\n\nUnder the direction of Charles Kettering, another influential American inventor and head of research at GM, Midgley worked his way through thousands of substances — including arsenic, sulfur and silicon — in a quest to find one that reduced knocking when added to gasoline. He eventually landed on tetraethyl lead, a lead derivative that was marketed simply as Ethyl. Leaded gasoline first went on sale in Dayton, Ohio, in 1923 and eventually spread throughout the world.\n\nLead is highly poisonous, with no safe level of exposure, and can impair development in children, causing decreased intelligence and behavioral disorders, according to UNICEF. An estimated 1 million people a year still die from lead poisoning, according to the World Health Organization.\n\nThe toxicity of lead was already well-known when Midgley added it to gas, but that didn’t stop Ethyl from becoming a commercial success.\n\n“There were alarms that were raised, because lead was known as a toxin,” Markowitz said. “But the position of the industry was that there was no proof that lead coming out of the tailpipes of cars was going to injure people. And it was that lack of proof that ultimately led the surgeon general not to take action after a public health conference in 1925.”\n\nHowever, workers in Ethyl manufacturing quickly experienced ill effects.\n\n“It was really the fact that the people working in the labs producing tetraethyl lead were getting sick that created a crisis,” Markowitz said. “They would literally go insane as a result of their exposure to lead.”\n\nMidgley went as far as pouring Ethyl over his hands and inhaling it during that 1924 news conference in an attempt to quench fears.\n\nBut in reality, he was also getting poisoned.\n\n“He definitely wrote in a letter in January of 1923 that he had a touch of lead poisoning, and he did have lead poisoning for the rest of his life,” said Bill Kovarik, a professor of communication at Radford University in Virginia. “It doesn’t really go away when you get that much lead in your body. It is a serious, long-term disability.”\n\nJust years after the invention of Ethyl, Midgley — again spurred by Kettering — turned his attention to developing a nontoxic, nonflammable alternative to refrigerant gases such as ammonia, which were used in appliances and air conditioners at the time, leading to a series of fatal accidents in the 1920s.\n\nHe came up with Freon — a derivative of methane, composed of carbon, chlorine and fluorine atoms — the first CFC. In another public demonstration, in 1930, Midgley inhaled the gas and blew out a candle with it, a move designed to show its safety.\n\nFreon, as well as subsequent CFCs, became commercial successes, and made air conditioning adoption shoot up in the United States. After World War II, manufacturers started routinely using CFCs as propellants for all sorts of products, including insecticides and hair spray.\n\nIt was the mid-1970s, three decades after Midgley’s death, before the damage from his two inventions became publicly known. CFCs had punched a hole in the ozone layer over Antarctica; if left unchecked, the hole would have expanded to the point of eventually threatening all life on Earth.\n\nAs a result of continued industry pressure, leaded gasoline was not phased out in the United States until 1996 and slowly thereafter throughout the world. The last nation to get rid of it, Algeria, still sold it until 2021, and lead additives continue to be used in aviation fuel. A 2022 study estimated that half of the current US population had been exposed to dangerous levels of lead in early childhood, but the damage to the world’s collective health is harder to quantify.\n\nIn 1987, the Montreal Protocol was signed to phase out CFCs from 1989 until 2010, after which they were banned. (CFC emissions have been rising again recently, a sign that they may still be produced illegally.) The hole in the ozone layer is on the mend and will likely heal in the next half–century in a rare environmental win.\n\n“The very sad truth is that we don’t know especially the number of children who have been adversely affected,” Markowitz said. “There is no safe level of lead in a child’s body. We’re talking tens of millions of children, hundreds of millions of children over a half-century or more that have been affected adversely, their life chances diminished from lead dust as a result of the exhaust gases that got into the ground or into the streets.”\n\nMidgley’s life ended under tragic circumstances. After contracting polio in 1940, he became severely disabled and devised yet another invention: a machine that would lift him out of bed and into a wheelchair autonomously, via strings and pulleys. But on November 2, 1944, he became entangled in the machine and died of strangulation.\n\nFor a long time, it was believed to have been the ultimate irony — the inventor dying by his own invention. But the reality may be even darker, according to Kovarik.\n\n“The official cause of death was suicide,” he said. “He had a tremendous sense of guilt. The industry told him he was brilliant. But he did stuff that in hindsight was pretty irresponsible. The lead poisoning could have contributed to his psychosis.”\n\nMidgley received several awards and honors in the late stages of his life. The Society of Chemical Industry awarded him the Perkin Medal in 1937; the American Chemical Society gave him the Priestley Medal in 1941 and elected him as president in the year of his death.\n\nA biographical memoir from the National Academy of Sciences, written by his mentor Kettering in 1947, contains nothing but praise and ends by saying that Midgley left behind “a great heritage to the world from a busy, a diversified, and a highly creative life.”\n\nHistory has other examples of inventions that turned out to be unwittingly deadly, such as TNT, which was originally developed for use as a yellow dye and not used as an explosive until decades later. Midgley is unique in having developed two such inventions, but although it’s tempting to see him as an environmental villain, experts say his role was more akin to a cog in the machine.\n\n“He was just an employee,” Kovarik said.\n\nMarkowitz agrees. “This was corporate-sponsored research,” he said. “Had it not been Midgley, I’m sure it would have been somebody else who would have come up with these solutions.”\n\nStriving for growth and innovation at all costs was reflective of the conception of progress in the first half of the 20th century, Markowitz added. “Only with the environmental movement that started in the 1960s and 1970s did we begin to consider what the consequences of technological progress could be,” he said.\n\n“That has had a really sobering effect, but up through the 1950s there were very few voices questioning the idea that progress was our most important product.”', '', 'Updated 9:57 AM EDT, Fri May 24, 2024', 'once-celebrated-an-inventors-breakthroughs-are-now-viewed-as-disasters-and-the-world-is-still-recovering-1745765218'),
(12, '‘Dyson spheres’ were theorized as a way to detect alien life. Scientists say they’ve found potential evidence', 'https://edition.cnn.com/2024/06/13/science/dyson-spheres-alien-life-evidence-scn/index.html', 'Jacopo Prisco', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-698572974.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_833,w_1480,c_fill', 'Freeman Dyson theorized that hypothetical alien megastructures would give off infrared radiation and searching for that byproduct would be a viable method for searching for extraterrestrial life.', 'What would be the ultimate solution to the energy problems of an advanced civilization? Renowned British American physicist Freeman Dyson theorized it would be a shell made up of mirrors or solar panels that completely surrounds a star — harnessing all the energy it produces.\n\n“One should expect that, within a few thousand years of its entering the stage of industrial development, any intelligent species should be found occupying an artificial biosphere which completely surrounds its parent star,” wrote Dyson in a 1960 paper in which he first explained the concept.\n\nIf it sounds like science fiction, that’s because it is: Dyson took the idea from Olaf Stapledon’s 1937 novel “Star Maker,” and he was always open about that. The late scientist was a professor emeritus at the Institute of Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey.\n\nStill, coming from a thinker who some in the scientific community say might have been worthy of a Nobel Prize early in his career, the concept took hold and the hypothetical megastructures became known as Dyson spheres, even though the physicist later clarified that they would actually consist of “a loose collection or swarm of objects traveling on independent orbits around the star.”\n\nIn his paper, Dyson also noted that Dyson spheres would give off waste heat detectable as infrared radiation, and suggested that looking for that byproduct would be a viable method for searching for extraterrestrial life. However, he added that infrared radiation by itself would not necessarily mean extraterrestrial intelligence, and that one of the strongest reasons for searching for such sources was that new types of natural astronomical objects might be discovered.\n\n“Scientists (at the time) were largely receptive, not to the likelihood that alien civilisations would be found to exist, but that a search for waste heat would be a good place to look,” said George Dyson, a technology writer and author and the second of Dyson’s six children, via email. “Science fiction, from ‘Footfall’ to ‘Star Trek,’ took the idea and ran with it, while social critics adopted the Dyson sphere as a vehicle for questioning the wisdom of unlimited technological growth.”\n\nThe elder Dyson himself argued, “It would be much more rewarding to search directly for intelligence, but technology is the only thing we have any chance of seeing.”\n\nIn the 1960s, there was no way to actually search for Dyson spheres, but in more recent times many researchers have looked for them, including those at the SETI Institute, a nonprofit organization with a mission to search for extraterrestrial intelligence, and Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, known as Fermilab. Now, a new study that looked at 5 million stars in the Milky Way galaxy suggests that seven candidates could potentially be hosting Dyson spheres — a finding that’s attracting scrutiny and alternate theories.\n\nThe authors of the study, published May 6 in the journal Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, specifically set out to search for Dyson spheres, in the form of infrared heat near stars that couldn’t be explained in any other way.\n\nUsing historical data from telescopes that pick up infrared signatures, the research team looked at stars located within less than 1,000 light-years from Earth: “We started with a sample of 5 million stars, and we applied filters to try to get rid of as much data contamination as possible,” said lead study author Matías Suazo, a doctoral student in the department of physics and astronomy of Uppsala University in Sweden.\n\n“So far, we have seven sources that we know are glowing in the infrared but we don’t know why, so they stand out.”\n\nThere is no conclusive evidence that the seven stars have Dyson spheres around them, Suazo cautioned.\n\n“It’s difficult for us to find an explanation for these sources, because we don’t have enough data to prove what is the real cause of the infrared glow,” he said. “They could be Dyson spheres, because they behave like our models predict, but they could be something else as well.”\n\nAmong the natural causes that could explain the infrared glow are an unlucky alignment in the observation, with a galaxy in the background overlapping with the star, planetary collisions creating debris, or the fact that the stars may be young and therefore still surrounded by disks of hot debris from which planets would later form.\n\nThe data used by the researchers comes from two active space telescopes — the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, or WISE, from NASA and Gaia from the European Space Agency — as well as an astronomical survey of the sky in infrared light called The Two Micron All Sky Survey. Also known as 2MASS, the collaboration between the University of Massachusetts and the US space agency’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory took place between 1997 and 2001.\n\nThe candidate stars are all red dwarfs, the most common type of star in our galaxy. They are also dimmer and smaller than our sun, which makes follow-up observations more difficult. It’s unclear at this point whether the stars have planets around them, as they haven’t been observed yet by any of the telescopes that could potentially spot orbiting planets. However, many of the thousands of exoplanets scientists have identified so far orbit red dwarfs, which makes their presence likely; planets orbiting red dwarfs have a higher chance of being inhabitable, according to NASA.\n\nAn earlier study, published in March and using data from the same sources as the new report, had also found infrared anomalies among a sample dataset of 5 million stars in our galaxy.\n\n“We got 53 candidates for anomalies that cannot be well explained, but can’t say that all of them are Dyson sphere candidates, because that’s not what we are specifically looking for,” said Gabriella Contardo, a postdoctoral research fellow at the International School for Advanced Studies in Trieste, Italy, who led the earlier study. She added that she plans to check the candidates against Suazo’s model to see how many tie into it.\n\n“You need to eliminate all other hypotheses and explanations before saying that they could be a Dyson sphere,” she added. “To do so you need to also rule out that it’s not some kind of debris disk, or some kind of planetary collision, and that also pushes the science forward in other fields of astronomy — so it’s a win-win.”\n\nBoth Contardo and Suazo agree that more research is needed on the data, and that ultimately they could turn to NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope for more information, as it is powerful enough to observe the candidate stars directly. However, because of the lengthy, competitive procedures that regulate use of the telescope, securing access might take some time.\n\nIf Dyson spheres really exist, what could they be used for? “If you picture ourselves having as much energy as the sun is providing every second, we could do unheard of things,” Suazo said. “We could do interstellar travel, maybe we could even move the entire solar system to our preferred location, if we wanted.”\n\nBut don’t hold your breath, because the technology and the raw materials required to build the hypothetical structures are far beyond humanity’s grasp.\n\n“They are so big that everything we have on Earth would not be enough to build them,” Suazo added. “Freeman Dyson said that we should dismantle Jupiter — the whole planet (for the raw materials).”\n\nThat supercolossal scale probably means that Dyson spheres, if they exist at all, are very rare.\n\n“The importance of this work is that it provides the first strong evidence that there are not a lot of Dyson Spheres in our galaxy, contrary to the expectations of some that they might be an inevitable end-state of technological species’ expansion out into their solar systems,” said study coauthor Jason Wright, a professor of astronomy and astrophysics at Penn State University, via email.\n\n“The candidates Matías (Suazo) has found are important because whatever they are — and they are likely stars surrounded by material from some sort of rare event, like a planetary collision, although they could be Dyson spheres — they are rare and interesting objects worthy of further study, for instance by the James Webb Space Telescope.”\n\nDyson died in 2020 before any of his spheres could be found — although they are just one of a dozen ideas that bear his name.\n\n“As a young scientist, Dyson showed that three competing quantum theories were actually the same theory — he summarily ended the competition,” said William Press, the Leslie Surginer Professor of Computer Science and Integrative Biology at the University of Texas at Austin. He was not involved in the study. “Later, he applied his genius to areas of astronomy, cosmology, the extraterrestrial realm, and also the very real problem of nuclear proliferation here on planet Earth. At the time of his death, he was recognized as a provocative and creative thinker.”\n\nGeorge Dyson also attested to his father’s fascination and comprehensive reach across disciplines.\n\n“Taking advantage of a short attention span and an aversion to bureaucracy, he contributed to five fields of mathematics and eleven fields of physics, as well as to theoretical biology, engineering, operations research, literature, and public affairs,” the younger Dyson said. “Many of his ideas were controversial, with one of his guiding principles being that ‘It is better to be wrong than to be vague.’”\n\nThe approach of the researchers behind the new study could offer a more fruitful path in the search for extraterrestrial intelligence, said Tomotsugu Goto, an associate professor of astronomy at the National Tsing Hua University in Taiwan. He also was not involved with the study.\n\n“However, contamination by circumstellar debris disks, which mimic Dyson Sphere infrared signatures, remains a concern,” he added in an email. “Authors argue that the debris disks around (dwarf stars) are rare, but the 7 candidate authors selected out of 5 million sources are also rare. Despite this, the seven candidates warrant further investigation with powerful telescopes for a more definitive evaluation.”\n\nA May 23 paper published in response to the one by Suazo and his colleagues suggests that at least three of the seven stars have been “misidentified” as Dyson spheres and could instead be “hot DOGs” — hot dust-obscured galaxies — and that the remaining four could probably be explained this way as well.\n\nBecause Suazo’s study touches on the fundamental question of whether humankind is alone in the universe, the search for Dyson candidates straddles different fields — including basic sciences, philosophy and religion — and might therefore increase the involvement of young scientists and the interest of the scientific world in the topic, according to Zaza Osmanov, an affiliate of SETI and associate dean of the School of Physics at the Free University of Tbilisi in Georgia, who also was not involved with the research.\n\nHowever, he added, the radiation fingerprint of the seven Dyson sphere candidates might be explained by natural phenomena as well. “The hypothesis of the artificial origin of any, even very interesting, radiation, should be the last springboard when all possible natural explanations are exhausted,” Osmanov said. “And for this, future research is necessary.”\n\nAs for Dyson himself, if he were still alive, he also would be highly skeptical that these observations represent a technological signature, his son George argued: “But the discovery of new, non-technological astronomical phenomena is exactly why he thought we should go out and look.”', '', 'Published 7:00 AM EDT, Thu June 13, 2024', 'dyson-spheres-were-theorized-as-a-way-to-detect-alien-life-scientists-say-theyve-found-potential-evidence-1745765218'),
(13, 'Why scientists say we need to send clocks to the moon — soon', 'https://edition.cnn.com/2024/05/30/science/lunar-time-zone-scale-nasa-artemis-scn/index.html', 'Jackie Wattles', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2153166412.jpg?q=w_1110,c_fill', 'NASA is working with its international partners to come up with a method for tracking time on the moon, seen here from Kars, Turkey, on May 18.', 'Perhaps the greatest, mind-bending quirk of our universe is the inherent trouble with timekeeping: Seconds tick by ever so slightly faster atop a mountain than they do in the valleys of Earth.\n\nFor practical purposes, most people don’t have to worry about those differences.\n\nBut a renewed space race has the United States and its allies, as well as China, dashing to create permanent settlements on the moon, and that has brought the idiosyncrasies of time, once again, to the forefront.\n\nOn the lunar surface, a single Earth day would be roughly 56 microseconds shorter than on our home planet — a tiny number that can lead to significant inconsistencies over time.\n\nNASA and its international partners are currently grappling with this conundrum.\n\nScientists aren’t just looking to create a new “time zone” on the moon, as some headlines have suggested, said Cheryl Gramling, the lunar position, navigation, and timing and standards lead at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland. Rather, the space agency and its partners are looking to create an entirely new “time scale,” or system of measurement that accounts for that fact that seconds tick by faster on the moon, Gramling noted.\n\nThe agency’s goal is to work with international partners to set up a new method of tracking time, specifically for the moon, that space-faring nations agree to observe.\n\nA recent memo from the White House also directed NASA to map out its plans for this new time scale by December 31, calling it “foundational” to renewed US efforts to explore the lunar surface. The memo also asks that NASA implement such a system by the end of 2026, the same year the space agency is aiming to return astronauts to the moon for the first time in five decades.\n\nFor the world’s timekeepers, the coming months could be crucial for figuring out how to accurately keep lunar time — and reach agreements on how, when and where to put clocks on the moon.\n\nSuch a framework will be crucial for humans visiting our closest celestial neighbor, Gramling told CNN.\n\nAstronauts on the moon, for example, are going to leave their habitats to explore the surface and carry out science investigations, she said. They’re also going to be communicating with one another or driving their moon buggies while on the lunar surface.\n\n“When they’re navigating relative to the moon,” Gramling said, “time needs to be relative to the moon.”\n\nSimple sundials or stone formations, which track shadows as the sun passes overhead, mark a day’s progression just as the shifting phases of the moon can log the passing of a month on Earth. Those natural timekeepers have kept humans on schedule for millennia.\n\nBut perhaps since mechanical clocks gained traction in the early 14th century, clockmakers have grown ever more persnickety about precision.\n\nExacting the measurement of seconds also grew more complicated in the early 1900s, thanks to Albert Einstein, the German-born physicist who rocked the scientific community with his theories of special and general relativity.\n\n“Darn that Einstein guy — he came up with general relativity, and many strange things come out of it,” said Dr. Bruce Betts, chief scientist at The Planetary Society, a nonprofit space interest group. “One of them is that gravity slows time down.”\n\nGeneral relativity is complicated, but in broad terms, it’s a framework that explains how gravity affects space and time.\n\nImagine that our solar system is a piece of fabric suspended in the air. That fabric is space and time itself, which — under Einstein’s theories — are inextricably linked. And every celestial body within the solar system, from the sun to the planets, is like a heavy ball sitting atop the fabric. The heavier the ball, the deeper the divot it creates, warping space and time.\n\nEven the idea of an earthly “second” is a humanmade concept that’s tricky to measure. And it was Einstein’s theory of general relativity that explained why time passes slightly more slowly at lower elevations — because gravity has a stronger effect closer to a massive object (such as our home planet).\n\nScientists have found a modern solution to all the complications of relativity for timekeeping on Earth: To account for imperceptible differences, they have set up a few hundred atomic clocks at various locations across the globe. Atomic clocks are ultra-precise instruments that use the vibration of atoms to measure the passage of time, and those clocks — in line with Einstein’s theories — tick slower the closer to Earth’s surface they sit.\n\nThe readings from atomic clocks around the world can be averaged for a broad but accurate as possible sense of time for planet Earth as a whole, giving us Coordinated Universal Time, or UTC. Still, occasionally “leap seconds” are factored in to keep UTC in line with slight changes in Earth’s speed of rotation.\n\nThis methodical keeping of time helps make the modern world go round — metaphorically speaking, said Kevin Coggins, deputy associate administrator and program manager for NASA’s Space Communications and Navigation Program.\n\n“If you’ve researched time on the Earth, you realize it is the critical enabler for everything: the economy, food security, trading, the financial community, even oil exploration. They use precise clocks,” Coggins said. “It’s in everything that matters in modern society.”\n\nIf time moves differently on the peaks of mountains than the shores of the ocean, you can imagine that things get even more bizarre the farther away from Earth you travel.\n\nTo add more complication: Time also passes slower the faster a person or spacecraft is moving, according to Einstein’s theory of special relativity.\n\nAstronauts on the International Space Station, for example, are lucky, said Dr. Bijunath Patla, a theoretical physicist with the US National Institute of Standards and Technology, in a phone interview. Though the space station orbits about 200 miles (322 kilometers) above Earth’s surface, it also travels at high speeds — looping the planet 16 times per day — so the effects of relativity somewhat cancel each other out, Patla said. For that reason, astronauts on the orbiting laboratory can easily use Earth time to stay on schedule.\n\nFor other missions — it’s not so simple.\n\nFortunately, scientists already have decades of experience contending with the complexities.\n\nSpacecraft, for example, are equipped with their own clocks called oscillators, Gramling said.\n\n“They maintain their own time,” Gramling said. “And most of our operations for spacecraft — even spacecraft that are all the way out at Pluto, or the Kuiper Belt, like New Horizons — (rely on) ground stations that are back on Earth. So everything they’re doing has to correlate with UTC.”\n\nBut those spacecraft also rely on their own kept time, Gramling said. Vehicles exploring deep into the solar system, for example, have to know — based on their own time scale — when they are approaching a planet in case the spacecraft needs to use that planetary body for navigational purposes, she added.\n\nFor 50 years, scientists have also been able to observe atomic clocks that are tucked aboard GPS satellites, which orbit Earth about 12,550 miles (20,200 kilometers) away — or about one-nineteenth the distance between our planet and the moon.\n\nStudying those clocks has given scientists a great starting point to begin extrapolating further as they set out to establish a new time scale for the moon, Patla said.\n\n“We can easily compare (GPS) clocks to clocks on the ground,” Patla said, adding that scientists have found a way to gently slow GPS clocks down, making them tick more in-line with Earth-bound clocks. “Obviously, it’s not as easy as it sounds, but it’s easier than making a mess.”\n\nFor the moon, however, scientists likely won’t seek to slow clocks down. They hope to accurately measure lunar time as it is — while also ensuring it can be related back to Earth time, according to Patla, who recently co-authored a paper detailing a framework for lunar time.\n\nThe study, for the record, also attempted to pinpoint exactly how far apart moon and Earth time are, as estimates have wavered between 56 and 59 microseconds per day.\n\nClocks on the moon’s equator would tick 56.02 microseconds faster per day than clocks at the Earth’s equator, according to the paper.\n\nWhat scientists know for certain is that they need to get precision timekeeping instruments to the moon.\n\nExactly who pays for lunar clocks, which type of clocks will go, and where they’ll be positioned are all questions that remain up in the air, Gramling said.\n\n“We have to work all of this out,” she said. “I don’t think we know yet. I think it will be an amalgamation of several different things.”\n\nAtomic clocks, Gramling noted, are great for long-term stability, and crystal oscillators have an advantage for short-term stability.\n\n“You never trust one clock,” Gramling added. “And you never trust two clocks.”\n\nClocks of various types could be placed inside satellites that orbit the moon or perhaps at the precise locations on the lunar surface that astronauts will one day visit.\n\nAs for price, an atomic clock worthy of space travel could cost around a few million dollars, according Gramling, with crystal oscillators coming in substantially cheaper.\n\nBut, Patla said, you get what you pay for.\n\n“The very cheap oscillators may be off by milliseconds or even 10s of milliseconds,” he added. “And that is important because for navigation purposes — we need to have the clocks synchronized to 10s of nanoseconds.”\n\nA network of clocks on the moon could work in concert to inform the new lunar time scale, just as atomic clocks do for UTC on Earth.\n\n(There will not, Gramling added, be different time zones on the moon. “There have been conversations about creating different zones, with the answer: ‘No,’” she said. “But that could change in the future.”)\n\nThe new time scale would underpin an entire lunar network, which NASA and its allies have dubbed LunaNet.\n\n“You can think of LunaNet like the internet — or the internet and a global navigation satellite system all combined,” Gramling said. It’s “a framework of standards that contributors to LunaNet (such as NASA or the European Space Agency) would follow.”\n\n“And you can think of the contributors maybe as your internet service provider,” Gramling added.\n\nCreating such a framework means bringing a lot of people across the world to the table. So far, Gramling said, conversations with US partners have been “very, very positive.”\n\nIt’s not clear whether NASA and its partners on this effort, which include the European Space Agency, will get a buy-in from nations that aren’t among US allies, such as China. Gramling noted those conversations would be held through international standard-setting bodies, such as the International Astronomical Union.\n\nAccurate clockwork is one matter. But how future astronauts living and working on the lunar surface will experience time is a different question entirely.\n\nOn Earth, our sense of one day is governed by the fact that the planet completes one rotation every 24 hours, giving most locations a consistent cycle of daylight and darkened nights. On the moon, however, the equator receives roughly 14 days of sunlight followed by 14 days of darkness.\n\n“It’s just a very, very different concept” on the moon, Betts said. “And (NASA is) talking about landing astronauts in the very interesting south polar region (of the moon), where you have permanently lit and permanently shadowed areas.

Their cute, Muppet-like look has turned these aquatic salamanders into pop culture sensations.', 'Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nScientist Dr. Randal Voss gets the occasional reminder that he’s working with a kind of superstar. When he does outreach events with his laboratory, he encounters people who are keen to meet his research subjects: aquatic salamanders called axolotls.\n\nThe amphibians’ fans tell Voss that they know the animals from the internet, or from caricatures or stuffed animals, exclaiming, “‘They’re so adorable, we love them,’” said Voss, a professor of neuroscience at the University of Kentucky College of Medicine. “People are drawn to them.”\n\nTake one look at an axolotl, and it’s easy to see why it’s so popular. With their wide eyes, upturned mouths and pastel pink coloring, axolotls look cheerful and vaguely Muppet-like.\n\nThey’ve skyrocketed in pop culture fame, in part thanks to the addition of axolotls to the video game Minecraft in 2021. These unusual salamanders are now found everywhere from Girl Scout patches to hot water bottles. But there’s more to axolotls than meets the eye: Their story is one of scientific discovery, exploitation of the natural world, and the work to rebuild humans’ connection with nature.\n\nAxolotl is a word from Nahuatl, the Indigenous Mexican language spoken by the Aztecs and an estimated 1.5 million people today. The animals are named for the Aztec god Xolotl, who was said to transform into a salamander. The original Nahuatl pronunciation is “AH-show-LOAT”; in English, “ACK-suh-LAHT-uhl” is commonly used.\n\nAxolotls are members of a class of animals called amphibians, which also includes frogs. Amphibians lay their jelly-like eggs in water, and the eggs hatch into water-dwelling larval states. (In frogs, these larvae are called tadpoles.)\n\nMost amphibians, once they reach adulthood, are able to move to land. Since they breathe, in part, by absorbing oxygen through their moist skin, they tend to stay near water.\n\nAxolotls, however, never complete the metamorphosis to a land-dwelling adult form and spend their whole lives in the water.\n\n“They maintain their juvenile look throughout the course of their life,” Voss said. “They’re teenagers, at least in appearance, until they die.”\n\nA signature feature of the axolotls’ forever-young look is their frilled external gills, which help them breathe in their watery home — the only spot they’re found in the wild: Lake Xochimilco in Mexico City.\n\nIt’s a bit of a scientific mystery why axolotls don’t transform into adult, land-dwelling versions of themselves. One hypothesis, according to Dr. Luis Zambrano, a professor of zoology at the National Autonomous University of Mexico, is that the environment in Lake Xochimilco had enough resources for the salamanders that “it was by far better for them not to expend energy transforming and stay in the lake.”\n\nThe 10-square-mile Lake Xochimilco is a unique body of water, a natural drainage basin with slightly salty water. More than 1,000 years ago, Xochimilca people in the region invented an agricultural system of human-made floating islands called chinampas. The chinampa system, with its drainage canals surrounding the islands, is still used by farmers called chinamperos today. The islands provided habitats and hiding places for the axolotls, which thrived among the chinampas for 1,000 years.\n\nHowever, the chinampas of Lake Xochimilco are no longer thriving, and neither are the salamanders. “The problems started at the beginning of the last century,” Zambrano said.\n\nAs Mexico City grew and became more industrialized, the need for water brought pumps and pipes to the lake, and eventually, “it was like a bad, smelly pond with rotten water,” Zambrano said. “All of our aquatic animals suffer with bad water quality, but amphibians suffer more because they have to breathe with the skin.”\n\nTo add to the axolotls’ problems, invasive fish species such as carp and tilapia were introduced to the lake, where they feed on axolotl eggs. And a 1985 earthquake in Mexico City displaced thousands of people, who found new homes in the area around the lake, further contributing to the destruction of the axolotls’ habitat.\n\nThese combined threats have devastated axolotl populations. According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature, there are fewer than 100 adult axolotls left in the wild. The species is considered critically endangered.\n\nWhile the wild axolotls of Lake Xochimilco have dwindled to near-extinction, countless axolotls have been bred for scientific laboratories and the pet trade. “The axolotl essentially helped establish the field of experimental zoology,” Voss said.\n\nIn 1864, a French army officer brought live axolotls back to Europe, where scientists were surprised to learn that the seemingly juvenile aquatic salamanders were capable of reproduction. Since then, scientists around the world have studied axolotls and their DNA to learn about the salamanders’ unusual metamorphosis (or lack thereof) as well as their ability to regrow injured body parts.\n\nIn addition to their role in labs, axolotls have become popular in the exotic pet trade (though they are illegal to own in California, Maine, New Jersey and Washington, DC). However, the axolotls you might find at a pet shop are different from their wild relatives in Lake Xochimilco. Most wild axolotls are a dark grayish brown. The famous pink axolotls, as well as other color variants such as white, blue, yellow and black, are genetic anomalies that are rare in the wild but selectively bred for in the pet trade.\n\nWhat’s more, “most of the animals in the pet trade have a very small genetic variance,” Zambrano said. Pet axolotls tend to be inbred and lack the wide flow of different genes that makes up a healthy population in the wild. That means that the axolotl extinction crisis can’t simply be solved by dumping pet axolotls into Lake Xochimilco. (Plus, the pet axolotls likely wouldn’t fare well with the poor habitat conditions in the lake.)\n\nThe difficulties that axolotls face in the wild are almost diametrically opposed to the fame they’ve found in recent years. Axolotls have captured the human imagination for centuries, as evidenced by their roles in Aztec religion and stories, but the early 21st century seems to be a high point for them. An axolotl graces the 50 peso bill. There are axolotl-inspired Pokemon, and Reddit commenters have noted that the character Toothless from the “How to Train Your Dragon” movie series is distinctly axolotl-like.\n\nThe introduction of axolotls to Minecraft in 2021 neatly mapped onto an uptick in Google searches for the animals, and social media makes it easy for people to gain access to photos and videos of the salamanders, particularly the photogenic pink ones often kept as pets.\n\nThe axolotl pet trade probably doesn’t directly harm the wild populations since wild salamanders aren’t being poached or taken from Lake Xochimilco. However, Zambrano said, axolotls’ ubiquity in pop culture and pet stores might make people assume that because axolotls “live in all the tanks around the world, they are not in danger.”\n\nZambrano has been working in axolotl conservation for more than two decades. It’s a somewhat unusual challenge, he said, because axolotls live so closely to so many people, so the answer to saving them isn’t simply to create a wildlife preserve and keep people out.\n\n“We have to be inventive in terms of the new ways of restoration and resilience and sustainable decisions,” he said.\n\nThese new practices include outreach efforts that aim for “synergy between local knowledge and scientific knowledge,” Zambrano said, especially among the chinamperos whose families have farmed the islands in Lake Xochimilco for generations.\n\nA widespread return to the chinampa system, he said, would benefit the axolotls, because it would ensure cleaner habitat space for the salamanders than the lake’s current, more industrial uses provide.\n\nSuch efforts would require policy changes, but according to Zambrano, worldwide enthusiasm for the axolotls could bolster such a campaign. People who love them can even symbolically adopt an axolotl to help fund conservation programs. Getting people to recognize that their favorite, friendly faced salamander doesn’t just exist in the vacuum of the internet, but in the real world where it faces dire conservation challenges, Zambrano said, is “a huge achievement.”\n\nKate Golembiewski is a freelance science writer based in Chicago who geeks out about zoology, thermodynamics and death.

But things don’t always end well for the ancient celestial objects, made of ice, frozen gases and rock, as they near the sun — and an untimely demise appears to hold true for Comet C/2025 F2 (SWAN).\n\nAll signs suggest that the celestial object, which resembled a fuzzy green patch, has disintegrated in the last couple days, said Qicheng Zang, a postdoctoral fellow studying small body astronomy at Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff, Arizona.\n\nThe latest ground-based observations from telescopes do seem to imply the comet has fallen apart, said Dr. Karl Battams, a computational scientist within the Solar and Heliospheric Physics Branch at the US Naval Research Laboratory in Washington, DC.\n\nAdditional observations will help confirm whether disintegration is the true cause of the comet’s apparent outburst and dimming.\n\n“There’s a remnant dust cloud that should continue to be telescopically visible for a few more weeks, but it’s spreading out and fading,” Zang said.\n\nSky-gazers in the Northern Hemisphere can see the comet’s remnant in the early morning.\n\nPrior to the disintegration, part of the hype around the comet was the fact that it was only recently discovered, and the comet’s closest pass of the sun on May 1 would present a once-in-a-lifetime viewing opportunity, likely not reappearing for hundreds of thousands of years — or leaving the solar system all together.\n\nNow, sky-gazers can essentially see the comet remnant’s final passage.\n\nThe object takes its name from the Solar Wind ANisotropies, or SWAN, instrument on the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory, or SOHO, spacecraft, a joint project of the European Space Agency and NASA. Amateur astronomers Vladimir Bezugly from Ukraine, Michael Mattiazzo in Australia and US-based Rob Matson each independently spotted and reported the object, known as Comet SWAN or SWAN25F, while looking through images taken by the SWAN instrument at the end of March. The Minor Planet Center officially designated it as C/2025 F2 (SWAN) on April 8.\n\nThe three astronomers “noticed a faint smudge, indicative of a comet, that seemed to move across the sky over a period of a few days.”\n\n“Since no comet was known to be in that part of the sky at that time, they correctly assumed it to be a new discovery,” Battams said.\n\nBattams is also principal investigator for the Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph instrument suite, a set of three telescopes on the SOHO spacecraft that takes images of the sun’s atmosphere.\n\nBattams recommends looking “low to the northeast horizon an hour or two before dawn” to see the remnant.\n\n“It will only be visible from the northern hemisphere until very early May, and then will gradually rise in the southern hemisphere skies,” Battams said in an email.\n\nJust remember to look low toward the horizon, rather than high in the sky, to see it.\n\nSome reports had shown that the comet’s initial brightness faded slightly within the last few days, Battams said.\n\nNow, astronomers recognize that this slight dimming was likely a sign of the comet’s fate.\n\n“It’s now likely the surge in brightness after the comet was discovered was actually the comet beginning to disintegrate,” Zang said in an email. “When they initially break apart, it exposes all the ice in its interior to the Sun, causing them to turn to gas (which we saw as the green glow that made the comet bright) all at once.”\n\nAs the ice runs out, gas gradually stops being released, and the comet dims, he said.\n\n“It looks like we’re now pretty much at the point where the ice/gas is just about all gone, so all that’s left is the dust.”\n\nAstronomers suspect the comet came from the Oort Cloud, a reservoir of icy bodies thought to exist at the edge of our solar system far from the warm reach of the sun.\n\n“Every now and then, an Oort Cloud comet will get gravitationally ‘nudged’ out of this reservoir and will begin to fall in towards the Sun,” Battams said in an email. “We think this comet has been heading inwards for about 35,000 years, although it’s difficult to be too precise about those numbers.”\n\nEarthSky has reported that recent observations suggest the comet completes one orbit around the sun every 2.1 million years.\n\nAs comets approach the sun, our star’s heat causes them to release gas and dust, which provide their signature tails.\n\nBigger comets, which are heavier, don’t tend to disintegrate as they near the sun. But it’s more common for smaller comets because as they release their gases, the celestial objects spin rapidly until they fly apart, Zang said.\n\n“The extreme solar radiation was more than this comet could handle,” Battams said. “Scientists are still trying to work out the specifics of what drives fragmentation like this. It is almost certainly a combination of factors or processes, but fundamentally it’s all due to a comet with a very volatile surface/composition getting too close to the Sun. It is definitely not uncommon, and I’m honestly not at all surprised this one in particular appears to be doing so.”\n\nLast October, the “Halloween comet” disintegrated during its closest approach of the sun.\n\nThe object, also known as Comet C/2024 S1 (ATLAS), was discovered on September 27 and quickly earned its nickname following speculation that it might be visible in the night sky near the end of October. But as the comet neared the sun, it broke apart into chunks until it finally evaporated, according to NASA.\n\nC/2024 S1 was a sungrazer, a comet that passes within a distance of about 850,000 miles (1,367,942 kilometers) from the sun. Sungrazers often vaporize due to the intense, hot solar atmosphere.\n\nComet C/2025 F2 (SWAN) was expected to pass within 31 million miles (50 million kilometers) of the sun in May.\n\nThe remnant will appear within the constellation Andromeda in the northeastern sky a couple of hours or so before sunrise, Zang said. Then, the dust cloud will reappear in the night sky toward the end of April. A new moon on the evening of April 27 will make the comet easier to see.\n\nThe remnant will be easier for those in the Southern Hemisphere to see in May, according to The Planetary Society.\n\nThe celestial object will appear near the constellation Taurus above the western horizon after sunset and appear higher in the sky each night in May.\n\nThe SWAN instrument wasn’t designed to pick out comets in the night sky, but it has contributed to the discovery of 16 comets to date, Zang said.\n\n“It’s a unique instrument designed to map out hydrogen in our solar system by looking at a certain type of light that gets scattered by neutral hydrogen atoms,” Battams said in an email. “But comets happen to be a very rich source of hydrogen — primarily by water of water-ice being vaporized by the Sun — and so they often glow quite brightly in the SWAN images.”\n\nZang first observed the comet on the morning of April 2 and has seen it twice since then. He took images of the part of the sky where the comet was said to be, based on coordinates shared by those who found it using the SWAN data, and spotted the celestial object.\n\nBattams said that Zang was the first to observe it from the ground after the amateur astronomers made the SWAN discovery, and his observations were crucial for allowing other astronomers to point their telescopes at the correct location.\n\nAstronomer Gianluca Masi also observed the comet twice using a telescope in Manciano, Italy.

But the study authors, and other experts, remain cautious and have not declared a definitive discovery of life beyond our planet.\n\nUsing the James Webb Space Telescope, the team detected chemical fingerprints within the atmosphere of K2-18b that suggest the presence of dimethyl sulfide or DMS, and potentially dimethyl disulfide or DMDS. On Earth, both molecules are only produced by microbial life, typically marine phytoplankton.\n\nA study detailing the findings was published Thursday in The Astrophysical Journal Letters.\n\nK2-18b, located 124 light-years from Earth, could be a Hycean world: a potentially habitable planet entirely covered in liquid water with a hydrogen-rich atmosphere, said lead study author Nikku Madhusudhan, professor of astrophysics and exoplanetary science at the University of Cambridge’s Institute of Astronomy.\n\nMadhusudhan and his colleagues first theorized the concept of Hycean worlds in 2021 after determining there may be liquid water oceans on K2-18b.\n\nThe planet is located within the habitable zone of its star, meaning that the world is at just the right temperature and distance from the star to host liquid water on its surface.\n\n“Earlier theoretical work had predicted that high levels of sulfur-based gases like DMS and DMDS are possible on Hycean worlds,” Madhusudhan said in a statement. “And now we’ve observed it, in line with what was predicted. Given everything we know about this planet, a Hycean world with an ocean that is teeming with life is the scenario that best fits the data we have.”\n\nIt’s possible that the molecules were produced by another unknown chemical process on the planet which does not require life.\n\nThe latest findings build on previous research by the same group of astronomers, who also detected carbon dioxide and methane within the planet’s atmosphere using Webb’s Near-Infrared Imager and Slitless Spectrograph and Near-Infrared Spectrograph instruments. The team made the new detection using Webb’s Mid-Infrared Instrument.\n\n“This is an independent line of evidence, using a different instrument than we did before and a different wavelength range of light, where there is no overlap with the previous observations,” Madhusudhan said. “The signal came through strong and clear.”\n\nBut Madhusudhan and his coauthors acknowledge that more data is needed before claiming direct evidence of life on another world. The team believes between 16 and 24 hours follow-up observations using Webb will make that possible.\n\n“It’s important that we’re deeply (skeptical) of our own results, because it’s only by testing and testing again that we will be able to reach the point where we’re confident in them,” Madhusudhan said. “That’s how science has to work.”\n\nHowever, other experts believe that while the results promise excitement, confirming the existence of life beyond Earth — and even deciding what type of exoplanet K2-18b is — will take much more time and data.\n\nAstrophysicist Sara Seager, a professor of physics, planetary science, aeronautics and astronautics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said independent teams have completely different interpretations of the planet itself. Seager was not involved in the new research.\n\n“Some propose a Hycean world, others suggest a hot magma ocean — a planet with molten rock beneath a hydrogen-rich atmosphere, which is about as inhospitable as it gets — and still others see it as a mini-Neptune,” Seager said, referring to worlds that are larger than Earth but smaller than Neptune. For reference, K2-18b is 8.6 times as massive and 2.6 times as large as Earth.\n\nSeager believes this finding, which suggests a candidate for a biosignature, “will remain in the candidate category indefinitely.”\n\n“For nearly 100 years, astronomers have wrestled with the idea that certain gases in a planet’s atmosphere ‘don’t belong’ — that they’re so reactive they shouldn’t exist without being continually replenished, possibly by life,” Seager said via email. “This idea traces back to James Jeans in 1930, who first identified molecular oxygen in Earth’s atmosphere as a sign of life, and used similar logic to place limits on oxygen in Venus’ atmosphere. Now, with thousands of exoplanets in view, the temptation to overinterpret is strong — and some are jumping the gun. When it comes to K2-18 b, enthusiasm is outpacing evidence.”\n\nWhen Madhusudhan and his team previously observed K2-18b, they detected a weak signal that might fit the hypothesis that the planet is a Hycean world.\n\n“We didn’t know for sure whether the signal we saw last time was due to DMS, but just the hint of it was exciting enough for us to have another look with JWST using a different instrument,” he said.\n\nWebb has the observational capability to peer through the atmosphere of exoplanets, or planets beyond our solar system. As exoplanets pass in front of their host star, from the perspective of Earth, light moves through their atmospheres, allowing Webb to detect the chemical signatures of gases within them.\n\nBoth dimethyl sulfide and dimethyl disulfide, which are part of the same chemical group, have overlapping characteristics, which is why the results can’t definitively differentiate between the two molecules, but future observations might, the study authors said.\n\nOn Earth, concentrations of dimethyl sulfide and dimethyl disulfide are typically below one part per billion in volume. However, the team estimates the presence of these molecules to be thousands of times stronger on K2-18b.\n\n“The inference of these biosignature molecules poses profound questions concerning the processes that might be producing them,” said study coauthor Subhajit Sarkar, a lecturer in the astronomy group at Cardiff University in Wales, in a statement.\n\nEddie Schwieterman, assistant professor of astrobiology at the University of California, Riverside, is “somewhat skeptical but very intrigued and excited about what’s next.” Schwieterman, who has studied K2-18b in the past, was not involved in the new research.\n\nHis group’s research found that in order to sustain the abundance of dimethyl sulfide in K2-18b’s atmosphere, “a production rate of about 20 times that of Earth’s DMS production is required.”\n\n“This is a high bar, but plausible considering local areas in Earth’s oceans are far more productive than the global average,” he said. “This threshold also poses an obstacle to attributing potential DMS to abiotic (non-biological) sources, since those abiotic sources would have to be much larger than any known ones.”\n\nBut Schwieterman said that first, scientists need to confirm that dimethyl sulfide is really present in the atmosphere of K2-18b, which will require validation from multiple independent groups who study the same data and analyze it for the chemical signature of the molecules. Madhusudhan said the data the study team analyzed will be released next week, so other astronomers can do just that.\n\nNext, Schwieterman wants to see additional Webb observations with a higher level of statistical significance to see whether the interpretation of dimethyl sulfide being present holds. Searching for the signatures of these molecules in atmospheres of other similarly sized planets within the habitable zones of their stars would also help, although it’s a process that will take years.\n\n“I do have at (least) one reason to be skeptical, which is that I’d anticipate the presence of ethane (C2H6) to accompany DMS/DMDS if those gases were present,” he said. “This is because UV rays from the star would break apart the DMS/DMDS into components we’d predict would react to form ethane. The absence of ethane makes me think we’ve missed something. Perhaps our models are wrong, or perhaps the DMS/DMDS isn’t there.”\n\nSchwieterman believes there is a lot of work to be done to validate the finding and assess the biosignature hypothesis presented by the paper.\n\nThe research team that authored the new paper say the observations have reached the three-sigma level of significance, or a 0.3% probability that the detections occurred by chance. For a scientific discovery, the observations must meet a five-sigma threshold, or below a 0.00006% that the observations occurred by chance.\n\nWhile the findings don’t represent a clear detection of dimethyl sulfide and dimethyl disulfide, “it is a step in the right direction,” said Dr. David Clements, an astrophysicist at Imperial College London. Clements was not involved in the research.\n\nMadhusudhan believes his team’s finding is a “major landmark in our search for life” that ushers in a new era.\n\n“In my mind, it is no longer a question of whether we will find life if such life exists,” he said. “We have demonstrated that we have the capability to do so with our initial current findings at reasonable significance. A bigger question in my mind is whether we as a species are prepared to find life as we don’t know it. We as a society, as a species, should come together and ask ourselves the question: What is it that constitutes life elsewhere?”', 'Webb telescope detections', 'Updated 11:41 PM EDT, Thu April 17, 2025', 'scientists-detect-signature-of-life-on-a-distant-planet-study-suggests-1745765219'),

It involved belligerent forces building an enclave close to the local royal palace.”\n\nHouston and his co-authors from the US and Guatemala began excavating the site in 2019, after scans of the area revealed structures under what they previously thought was a natural hill.\n\n“Only a bit of this palace is visible on the surface. The rest and especially the deeper layers are only accessible through tunnels excavated by archaeologists,” Houston told CNN via email. “Typically, we find a floor and walls, and follow along them, thus exposing buried buildings.”\n\nAs the researchers investigated, they discovered this altar, which still bears the faint outlines of a person wearing a feathered headdress on each panel and traces of bright red, black and yellow paints. Such a design resembles other representations of a deity known as the “Storm God,” more common in Teotihuacan than Mayan art.\n\nTwo bodies were buried underneath the altar – one probably an adult male and the other a small child aged between 2 and 4 years old, who was buried in a seated position much more commonly seen in Teotihuacan than in Tikal.\n\nThe bodies of three other infants were discovered around the altar, buried in a similar way to other infant graves in Teotihuacan. The authors didn’t specify what caused their deaths.\n\n“The altar confirms that Teotihuacan rituals were used in the very center of Tikal, involving people who used utterly foreign, Teotihuacan painting styles, to depict foreign gods,” Houston told CNN via email.\n\nSome of the remains may have belonged to Maya individuals, Houston said, “but the tomb finds suggest close contact with, and perhaps an origin in, Teotihuacan. The sacrifices of infants fit with Mexican practices.”\n\nThese cultural practices point toward the increasing Teotihuacan influence in Tikal, the researchers said in their paper.\n\nAnd the fact that these buildings were subsequently buried and never built on again “probably speaks to the complicated feelings (the Maya) had about Teotihuacan,” said co-author Andrew Scherer, a professor of anthropology and archaeology at Brown.\n\n“The Maya regularly buried buildings and rebuilt on top of them,” he said in a statement. “But here, they buried the altar and surrounding buildings and just left them, even though this would have been prime real estate centuries later. They treated it almost like a memorial or a radioactive zone.”\n\nThis latest discovery uncovers another layer of the complicated relationship between the two cultures that recent research has revealed.\n\nIn the 1960s, researchers found a stone bearing an inscription that described a conflict between the Maya and Teotihuacan, and learnt that “around AD 378, Teotihuacan was essentially decapitating a kingdom,” Houston said.\n\n“They removed the king and replaced him with a quisling, a puppet king who proved a useful local instrument to Teotihuacan.”\n\nThis altar was probably built at a similar time to the coup, Scherer said, which eventually propelled the Mayan kingdom to its most powerful point, before it declined around 900 AD.\n\nThe findings of this excavation show “a tale as old as time,” Houston added, referring to empires sparring and competing for cultural influence.\n\n“Everyone knows what happened to the Aztec civilization after the Spanish arrived … These powers of central Mexico reached into the Maya world because they saw it as a place of extraordinary wealth, of special feathers from tropical birds, jade and chocolate,” he said. “As far as Teotihuacan was concerned, it was the land of milk and honey.”', '', 'Updated 7:36 PM EDT, Fri April 11, 2025', 'mysterious-altar-found-in-ancient-mayan-city-contains-bodies-and-wasnt-made-by-the-maya-1745765219'),

Who the tomb belonged to remains a mystery.', 'A newly uncovered ancient Egyptian tomb is shedding light on royalty that once ruled the region over 3,600 years ago.\n\nArchaeologists discovered the massive limestone burial chamber, which has multiple rooms and a decorated entryway, in January in Abydos, Egypt. But the lavish tomb’s intended occupant remains a mystery. Graverobbers had damaged the hieroglyphic text painted on bricks at the entryway, leaving the name unreadable, according to a news release issued March 27 by the Penn Museum at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nThe impressive tomb didn’t contain skeletal remains that could help identify its owner. However, the researchers who made the discovery believe it is likely the resting place of a king who ruled upper Egypt during the Second Intermediate Period between 1640 and 1540 BC as part of the Abydos Dynasty, one of the least understood dynasties of ancient Egypt. The mystery king might be one of several who are notoriously missing from the traditional records of monarchs who once ruled the region.\n\n“It’s a very sort of mysterious, enigmatic dynasty that seems to have basically been sort of forgotten from the ancient records of Egypt, because it was in this period of political decay and fragmentation,” said Josef Wegner, an Egyptologist and professor of Egyptian archaeology at the University of Pennsylvania, who led the excavation. “This mystery tomb … opens a new kind of avenue of investigation (into the Abydos Dynasty).”\n\nThe burial chamber is the largest to be discovered from any known ruler from the same dynasty, illuminating a previously misunderstood period of history that can only be revealed through material remains, experts say.\n\nArchaeologists found the tomb nearly 23 feet (about 7 meters) underground at the site of an ancient necropolis, or “city of the dead.” The necropolis is situated at Abydos’ Anubis Mountain, a natural pyramid-shaped formation that was considered sacred by the ancient Egyptians and served to conceal the tombs built beneath it.\n\nIn historical records, Abydos was referred to as a sacred city that was the final resting place of Osiris — the god of the underworld — and the preferred resting place for the first pharaohs. The necropolis developed over the course of centuries as more dynasties built tombs and buried their kings within the royal cemetery.\n\nOver a decade ago, Wegner and his team came across the first tomb within this necropolis that confirmed the existence of the Abydos Dynasty, a ruling lineage that had been first hypothesized about in 1997 by Egyptologist Kim Ryholt. Ryholt believed the smaller dynasty would have ruled the region of Abydos during a time when ancient Egypt was broken into rival kingdoms.\n\nThat first tomb’s owner, King Seneb-Kay, was an entirely unknown pharaoh who was never mentioned in historical records. Of the eight tombs from the dynasty discovered thus far, Seneb-Kay’s is the only one found with a name preserved in the burial chamber.\n\nThe newly found tomb is similar in architecture and decoration but is much larger than Seneb-Kay’s — the main compartment of the three-chambered crypt is about 1.9 meters (6.2 feet) wide by 6 meters (19.7 feet) long. Because the tomb was built in a section of the necropolis that the researchers believe was established earlier in time, they think that the wealthy king buried there was likely a predecessor to Seneb-Kay.\n\nThe scientists suspect that the tomb might have belonged to King Senaiib or King Paentjeni, two monarchs represented in the sparse archaeological record of the dynasty that exists as part of a dedicated monument at Abydos.\n\n“It is equally possible there could be some entirely unknown king,” said Wegner, who is also curator of the Penn Museum’s Egyptian section. “We don’t think we have all of (the Abydos kings) names — evidence hasn’t survived consistently for them.”\n\nWhile any markings that might help pinpoint the freshly unearthed burial chamber’s former occupant didn’t survive, the tomb does still have two painted images of the goddesses Isis and Nephthys, who were commonly depicted in funerary rites as if they were mourning the deceased.\n\nThe researchers plan to investigate about 10,000 square meters (over 100,000 square feet) more of the area’s desert terrain in an effort to uncover additional tombs, Wegner said. “There could easily be 12 or 15 kings that compose this group of kings,” he said.\n\nIn addition to further excavation, the researchers will scope out the area using ground penetrating radar, technology that uses sound waves to map structures below Earth’s surface, as well as magnetometry, which creates maps of structures underground that have magnetic signatures.\n\n“The discovery of another ruler of the Abydos dynasty is very exciting,” said Salima Ikram, a distinguished university professor of Egyptology at the American University in Cairo, in an email. “It establishes that there was a significant royal … cemetery here of that time, provides us with more details about royal tomb architecture, (and) gives us a clue as to the members of this dynasty and the order in which they ruled.”\n\nIkram was not involved with the burial chamber’s discovery but said she is hopeful that future excavations will yield more tombs that will help to “further our understanding of this once-obscure period of Egyptian history.”\n\nAbydos Dynasty kings such as Seneb-Kay are unique because they do not appear on the king lists that were once kept by the ancient Egyptians.\n\n“The Egyptian kings liked to present their history as straightforward and linear and they recorded (king) names in order. These kings aren’t on there. So if we look at this sort of strict historical record, we have no place for these kings,” said Laurel Bestock, an Egyptologist and associate professor of archaeology at Brown University in Rhode Island. Bestock was not involved with the new tomb discovery.\n\n“When we find these monuments, it shows us how inadequate that strict, linear historical record is — it was really written, not to be accurate, but to support a particular point of view of later kings who went and reunified Egypt,” Bestock added. “They wrote of themselves as great victors and as having won ethnic wars, and they just kind of ignored all the little players.”\n\nDiscoveries such as this latest Abydos tomb are “incredibly exciting” because they provide context for a richer history, regardless of whether this king’s identity is revealed or not, Bestock noted.\n\nAs of now, the king to whom the burial chamber belonged remains a mystery, but Wegner’s goal is to one day identify the ruler to help anchor him within the historical timeline. “With archaeology you hope for evidence,” Wegner said. ”The archaeological record, you know, it gives you surprises and twists and turns along the way, so you never know what you can find.”', 'The lost pharaoh', 'Published 7:00 AM EDT, Sat April 5, 2025', 'archaeologists-uncover-an-ancient-egyptian-tomb-belonging-to-a-mystery-king-1745765219'),

The injuries to the bones are clearly the result of combat,” it added.\n\nThe bones were dated to approximately 80 to 230 AD.\n\nThe men were probably robbed of their weapons, since only a small number of objects were found alongside them, according to the release.\n\nArchaeologists uncovered two iron spearheads, one of which was found lodged in a hip bone.\n\nNumerous hobnails were discovered near the feet of one individual. These nails would have studded the underside of leather Roman military shoes, the museum said.\n\nAn X-ray of the scabbard of a rusted and corroded iron dagger revealed typical Roman decorations of inlays of silver wire. This was dated to between the mid-1st century and early 2nd century AD.\n\nThere were also several pieces of scale armor, which became customary around 100 AD, the museum said. However, they were unusual in having more square-shaped features than round, it added.\n\nA cheek piece from a Roman helmet was found to be from a type that became customary from the middle of the 1st century.\n\n“We are blown away by this find. It is a genuine game-changer,” Kristina Adler-Wölfl, head of the Vienna Department of Urban Archaeology, told CNN Friday, adding that this is “a once-in-a-lifetime discovery” for the museum’s archaeologists.\n\n“There is archaeological evidence of Roman battlefields in Europe, but none from the 1st/2nd century CE with fully preserved skeletons,” she said.\n\nAround 100 AD, ritualized cremation burials were common in the Roman-governed parts of Europe, with whole-body burials “an absolute exception,” according to the museum. “Finds of Roman skeletons from this period are therefore extremely rare,” it said.\n\n“The undignified nature of the burial site along with the deadly wounds found on each individual suggests a catastrophic military confrontation, possibly followed by a hasty retreat,” Adler-Wölfl added.\n\nHistorical records show that in the late 1st century, during the reign of the emperor Domitian, costly battles took place on the Roman Empire’s northern Danube border between the Romans and Germanic tribes.\n\n“This is the first time we have material evidence of the Germanic wars” fought by Domitian between 86 and 96 AD, Adler-Wölfl said. “Before the find, we knew about these conflicts only through some written sources.”\n\n“Our preliminary investigation suggests with near certainty that the mass grave is the result of such a Roman-Germanic battle, one that likely took place in or around 92 CE,” she added.\n\nThe destruction of an entire legion is included in reports of disastrous defeats, which later led to the extension of the fortification line known as the Danube Limes under the emperor Trajan, according to the museum.\n\nThe Roman expansion of the town of Vindobona, which later became Vienna, “from a small military site to a full-scale legionary fortress occurred in that context,” said Adler-Wölfl.\n\n“This would place the mass grave in immediate conjunction with the beginning of urban life in present-day Vienna,” she added.\n\nThe initial investigation by the team in Vienna will form part of a larger international research project, the museum said.

Study coauthor Harald Ringbauer said it was unusual to encounter such an isolated genetic ancestry, especially compared with Europe, where there was much more mixing. Ringbauer is a researcher and group leader of archaeogenetics at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany, which has pioneered techniques to receive genetic material from old bones and fossils.\n\nThis genetic isolation, the authors of the study reasoned, suggested the region likely wasn’t a migration corridor that linked sub-Saharan Africa to Northern Africa despite the Sahara’s hospitable conditions at the time.\n\nPast analyses of cave paintings and animal remains found at archaeological sites across the Sahara have suggested its inhabitants were pastoralists who herded sheep, goats or cattle, prompting some researchers to hypothesize the herders spread from the Near East where farming originated.\n\nHowever, such migration was unlikely, given the genetic isolation of the Takarkori group, the authors of the new report suggested. Instead, the study team hypothesized, pastoralism was adopted via a process of cultural exchange, such as interaction with other groups that already raised domesticated animals.\n\n“We know now that they were isolated in terms of genetics, but not in cultural terms. There’s a lot of networks that we know from several parts of the continent, because we have pottery coming from sub-Saharan Africa. We have pottery coming from the Nile Valley and the like,” di Lernia said.\n\n“They had this kind of lineage, which is quite ancestral, (which) points to some kind of Pleistocene legacy, which needs to be explored,” he said, referring to the time period that came to an end around 11,000 years ago before the current Holocene Epoch.\n\nLouise Humphrey, a research leader at the Natural History Museum’s Centre for Human Evolution Research in London, said she agreed with the study’s findings: The Takarkori people were largely genetically isolated for thousands of years, and that pastoralism in this region was established through cultural diffusion, rather than the replacement of one population with another.\n\n“DNA extracted from two pastoralist women who were buried at the rock shelter around 7,000 years ago reveals that most of their ancestry can be traced to a previously unknown ancient North African genetic lineage,” Humphrey said. She wasn’t involved in the research but has worked at Taforalt cave in eastern Morocco, where 15,000-year-old hunter-foragers were buried.\n\n“Future research integrating archaeological and genomic evidence is likely to yield further insights into human migrations and cultural change in this region,” Humphrey said.\n\nChristopher Stojanowski, a bioarchaeologist and professor at Arizona State University, said one of the study’s more interesting findings was the “inference of a moderately large population size and no evidence of inbreeding.”\n\n“That there was little evidence of inbreeding suggests a degree of movement and connection that is also somewhat at odds with the idea of a long-term, disconnected Green Sahara population,” Stojanowski, who wasn’t involved in the study, added.\n\nExperts have studied the skeletons and artifacts unearthed at the site over the years, but attempts to recover DNA from the remains proved elusive.\n\nIn 2019, scientists were able to recover mitochondrial DNA, which traces the maternal line, but obtaining this DNA didn’t paint the full picture, Ringbauer said.\n\n“A couple of years ago, the samples made their way to Leipzig, because we have continuously fine-tuned new methods over the last years to make more out of a very tiny amount of DNA … and the samples had very little DNA,” said Ringbauer, who uses computation tools to analyze genetic data.\n\nAncient DNA is often fragmented and contaminated. It preserves best in cool environments, not the extreme temperature swings of the world’s largest hot desert. However, Ringbauer and his colleagues at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology were able to extract enough DNA from the two mummies to sequence their genomes, a more complete set of genetic material that allowed geneticists to piece together information about a population’s ancestry, not just that of an individual.\n\n“The whole genome carries the DNA for many of your ancestors,” Ringbauer said. “As you go along the genome, you start seeing the different trees of your ancestors. One genome carries the stories of many.”', 'Mummies reveal secrets of the Sahara’s past', 'Updated 9:22 AM EDT, Thu April 3, 2025', 'ancient-dna-sheds-light-on-origins-of-7000yearold-saharan-mummies-1745765219'),

In Southern California, they’ll go down a little bit deeper into 18 kilometers (11 miles),” said Kilb, a researcher at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the University of California, San Diego, referring to the depths at which earthquakes usually occur in those regions.\n\nBut the earthquakes she found taking place near the central region of the mountain range were up to twice as deep — and appear to be ongoing.\n\n“The fact that we see some seismicity that’s below 20 kilometers (12.4 miles) — like 20 kilometers to 40 kilometers (25 miles) — is very odd,” Kilb said. “It’s not something you would typically see in crustal earthquakes.”\n\nKilb flagged the data to Vera Schulte-Pelkum, a research scientist at the Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences and an associate research professor of geological sciences at the University of Colorado Boulder. Schulte-Pelkum was already studying the Sierra Nevada’s peculiar rock footprint, which had shown deep rock deformations within the same area.\n\nUsing the newfound data, the researchers imaged the Sierra Nevada through a technique known as receiver function analysis, which uses seismic waves to map Earth’s internal structure. The scientists found that in the central region of the mountain range, Earth’s crust is currently peeling away, a process scientifically known as lithospheric foundering. Kilb and Schulte-Pelkum reported the findings in December in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.\n\nThe hypothesis lined up with previous speculation that the area had undergone lithospheric foundering, which happens when Earth’s outermost layer sinks into the lower layer of the mantle. Now, the study authors believe that the process is ongoing and is currently progressing to the north of the mountain range, according to the study.\n\n“We compared notes and realized that my strange rock fabric (the arrangement of rocks) signals and her strange deep earthquakes were in the same area,” Schulte-Pelkum said. “So then we decided to look at it more closely, and found this whole story.”\n\nWhat’s happening under the Sierra Nevada could offer rare insight into how the continents formed, Schulte-Pelkum said. The finding could also help scientists identify more areas where this process is happening as well as provide a better understanding of earthquakes and how our planet operates, she added.\n\nEarth’s uppermost layer, the lithosphere, is made up of the rigid crust and the top part of the mantle, which is in a denser, but more fluid state. This layer also contains Earth’s oceanic crust — a thinner and denser layer below the oceans — and the continental crust that sits above this layer. But how these sublayers manage to exist in this ideal state, with the continents on top, is something of a mystery, Schulte-Pelkum said.\n\n“The continents just happened to be sticking up above the current sea level, luckily for us, because … they’re made of less dense minerals on average,” Schulte-Pelkum said. “To make it sit higher (in the first place), you have to get rid of some of the dense stuff.”\n\nLithospheric foundering is the process of the denser materials being pulled to the bottom, while the less dense material emerges at the top, resulting in land creation. “It’s dumping some of this denser stuff into this gooey, solid mantle layer underneath and sort of basically detaching it so it stops pulling on the less dense stuff above,” she explained.\n\nWithin the imaging of Earth below the Sierra Nevada, the researchers found a distinct layer within the mantle about 40 to 70 kilometers (25 to 43 miles) deep. This layer had specific imprints that gradually changed due north, the data showed.\n\nIf one were to have a block of clay that had spots of different colored clay throughout, and squeezed the clay between their hands, the spots would start to turn into stripes — this is similar to how the rock deformations appear, Schulte-Pelkum said.\n\nIn the southern Sierra, the dense rocks had the strongest inherent stripes and were shown to have already sheared away from the crust, whereas in the central region this process appears to be ongoing. In the northern Sierra, there are currently no signs of deformation. This distinct layer within the mantle would also explain the deep earthquakes Kilb found, as the crust in the central region is unusually thick from being pulled down and is also colder than the hot mantle material typically found at those depths.\n\n“Rock takes a really long time to warm up or cool down. So if you move some stuff, you know, by pulling it down or pushing it up, it takes a while for it to adjust its temperature,” Schulte-Pelkum said.\n\nEvidence for this process has been hard to come by. It is not visible from above ground, and it’s an extremely slow process. Scientists theorize that the south Sierra finished the process of lithospheric foundering about 4 million to 3 million years ago, according to the study.\n\nIt appears that these natural events happen occasionally around the world, Schulte-Pelkum said. “Geologically speaking, this is a pretty quick process with long periods of stability in between. … This (lithosphere foundering) probably started happening a long time ago when we started building continents, and (the continents) have gotten bigger over time. So it’s just sort of this punctuated, localized thing,” she added.\n\nThe Sierra Nevada has been a topic of debate for decades in the geology community due to an anomaly found within the mantle located underneath the Great Valley.\n\nWhile some scientists believe lithospheric foundering caused this feature, other scientists think it may be caused by subduction, which is when an oceanic plate sinks beneath a less dense plate, such as continental crust, and changes the landscape, said Mitchell McMillan, a research geologist and postdoctoral fellow at Georgia Tech, who was not involved with the study.\n\n“There are really two competing hypotheses to explain all these data, and you don’t really get that very often in geology. … So this paper is going to add to that whole discussion in a really neat way,” he said.\n\nFurther study within this area could also help scientists better understand how the Earth evolves on long timescales. If the lithospheric foundering continues underneath the mountain range, one can speculate that the land will continue to stretch vertically, changing the way the landscape looks now, McMillan said. But that could take anywhere from several hundred thousand to a few million years, he added.\n\nIn general, large mountain belts, or anywhere there is a batholith, is where you expect to find these events, McMillan said. The Andes, a long mountain range in South America, is an example of another place where scientists speculate lithosphere foundering once occurred and could still be happening today, he added.\n\n“I think this study in particular (highlights) the importance of tying together these different datasets,” McMillan said.\n\nBy better understanding this process, scientists can learn more about the functions of the planet and what happens beneath its surface, including the occurrence of earthquakes that have been linked to this process, McMillan said. Separately, the planet Venus, which does not have plate tectonics like Earth, has evidence of these lithospheric foundering events, and by understanding the process on Earth, we can start to apply it to Venus, he said.\n\n“It’s really fascinating to think about how you could be … hiking in the Sierra or in the foothills, or even anywhere else on a continent.

The space rock dates to around 4.6 billion years ago and is believed to be similar in composition to early Earth, according to a study published Wednesday in the journal Icarus.\n\nThe researchers found that the majority of the hydrogen contained within the meteorite was intrinsic, rather than being present due to contamination, suggesting that early Earth would have been home to sufficient hydrogen to have allowed the formation of water molecules.\n\nThis finding calls into question the widely held belief that hydrogen arrived on Earth in asteroids that bombarded what was previously a dry, rocky planet incapable of supporting life.\n\n“We assumed that Earth has water today because of quite a lucky scenario where it had been hit by these asteroids,” lead study author Tom Barrett, a doctoral student in the department of Earth sciences at the University of Oxford, told CNN on Wednesday.\n\n“But what we’ve demonstrated in this study is that actually the material which formed Earth in the first instance actually did contain a lot of hydrogen and oxygen,” he added. “The discovery of hydrogen in this meteorite means that Earth potentially could have been hydrated or wet from its initial formation.”\n\nAs for why the levels of hydrogen identified in the study previously hadn’t been detected, Barrett explained the chemical element is hard to measure, particularly at such low concentrations. The detection was only possible thanks to a technique known as X-ray Absorption Near Edge Structure, or XANES, spectroscopy, he said.\n\n“To do that you need a particle accelerator,” he said. “This is like an enormous, really expensive facility, which we’ve been very fortunate to have used to this study. But it’s not exactly the kind of experiment that you can do in the garage.”\n\nThe study potentially upends our understanding of early Earth, but the discovery of hydrogen in the meteorite doesn’t mean that life would have necessarily evolved sooner, Barrett said. This is because the habitability of a planet may depend more on the way it evolves than the material it is formed from, he said.\n\nA team of scientists at the French National Centre for Scientific Research had previously analyzed the meteorite, known as LAR 12252, which had been collected in Antarctica. The August 2020 study found that the space rock’s chondrules, or minuscule spherical objects, and organic material contained within it had traces of hydrogen. The research, however, only accounted for a portion of the hydrogen within the meteorite.\n\nThe researchers behind the new study believed more hydrogen could be attached to sulphur within the meteorite. The team unexpectedly detected hydrogen sulphide within the fine matrix immediately surrounding the chondrules — “on average almost 10 times more” hydrogen sulphide than found in the spherical objects, according to the study.\n\n“We were incredibly excited when the analysis told us the sample contained hydrogen sulphide — just not where we expected!” Barrett said in a statement. “Because the likelihood of this hydrogen sulphide originating from terrestrial contamination is very low, this research provides vital evidence to support the theory that water on Earth is native — that it is a natural outcome of what our planet is made of.”\n\nNext, Barrett plans to analyze more meteorites in an effort to ascertain exactly how much hydrogen would have been present on Earth, and how much may have been delivered from external sources.\n\nWorking out how Earth came to look the way it does today is a fundamental question for planetary scientists, said study coauthor James Bryson, an associate professor in the department of Earth sciences at the University of Oxford.\n\n“We now think that the material that built our planet — which we can study using these rare meteorites — was far richer in hydrogen than we thought previously,” he said.\n\n“This finding supports the idea that the formation of water on Earth was a natural process, rather than a fluke of hydrated asteroids bombarding our planet after it formed.”\n\nMatt Genge, a planetary scientist at Imperial College London, who was not involved in the study, told CNN that while the study is an “interesting result,” the evidence is not sufficient to overturn the longstanding theory of the origins of water.\n\nThe meteorite in question had been in Antarctica likely for hundreds of thousands of years, he said, and it is impossible to completely rule out the chance that the hydrogen may have formed during that time.\n\n“Just the fact that there is a possibility makes the argument less strong,” Genge said.\n\nBryson acknowledged that the meteorite was indeed likely on Earth for many years before it was collected but stands by the study results.\n\n“We believe we have taken every effort we can in our analysis workflow to mitigate the impact of terrestrial water on our results, and we do think that some of the total amount of H (hydrogen) in the meteorite is due to Earth’s water (maybe about 15%),” Bryson said via email in response to Genge’s statement.\n\n“We also think that some H (hydrogen) was still delivered from asteroids and comets, however we now think this is a small proportion of the total H (hydrogen) found throughout our planet.

While the colossal squid is thought to grow up to 23 feet (7 meters) long and weigh as much as 1,110 pounds (500 kilograms) — which makes it the heaviest invertebrate on the planet — this juvenile squid measures nearly 1 foot (30 centimeters) long.\n\nThe squid has lost some of its “baby features,” such as stalked eyes that stick out the side of its head. Rather, the eyes are part of the head, and the head and body are more proportional to one another, said Dr. Aaron Evans, an independent researcher and an expert on Cranchiidae, or the glass squid family to which the colossal squid belongs. Evans, who did not participate in the expedition, independently verified the species along with Dr. Kat Bolstad, associate professor at New Zealand’s Auckland University of Technology.\n\n“We could think of this maybe as a teenager squid,” Evans said during a news conference Tuesday. “It’s not quite an adult. It hasn’t fully matured yet. It’s still got a lot of growing to do. But it’s not a baby either. So, it’s a very exciting specimen for us to examine. For us to see this kind of midrange size in between a hatchling and an adult is really exciting because it gives us the opportunity to fill in some of those missing puzzle pieces to the life history of this very mysterious animal.”\n\nAdditionally, a team aboard a previous Falkor (too) expedition in January to the Southern Ocean near Antarctica captured footage of the glacial glass squid, which has never been seen before alive in its environment.\n\n“The first sighting of two different squids on back-to-back expeditions is remarkable and shows how little we have seen of the magnificent inhabitants of the Southern Ocean,” Dr. Jyotika Virmani, the Schmidt Ocean Institute’s executive director, said in a statement.\n\nThe high-resolution video footage of both squid species, which allowed scientists to confirm their identities, is opening a new window to delicate ocean life and shedding light on how animals survive within its depths.\n\nLittle is known about the life and behaviors of the colossal squid. Most of what scientists understand about the animal has come from dead or dying specimens found within the stomachs of whales and seabirds, or as predators of toothfish that are harvested and caught for human consumption, Bolstad said.\n\nBut with the new footage comes fresh insights, which were captured during the flagship expedition on a quest to search for previously unknown marine life, a collaboration between the Schmidt Ocean Institute, the Nippon Foundation-Nekton Ocean Census and GoSouth. GoSouth is a joint project of the UK’s University of Plymouth, GEOMAR Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research in Germany and the British Antarctic Survey.\n\nBolstad and Evans carefully reviewed the footage to search for identifying features of the colossal squid. Squid have eight shorter arms and two longer tentacles. Something that distinguishes the colossal squid is the presence of hooks on the middle of its eight arms. Evans said he began hyperventilating with excitement when he noticed the hooks present on the recently filmed juvenile squid.\n\n“I have been researching deep-sea squids, including the colossal, since the early 2000s, and I can say that this is honestly one of the most exciting observations that we’ve had across the time that I’ve been working on deep-sea cephalopods,” Bolstad said during the news conference. “One of the things I love about this footage is how delicate this animal appears to be. It looks like a glass sculpture. Looking at these animals … thriving and in that delicate state, and then thinking about what it takes for humans to even remotely get to that environment … it’s just a great reminder of how much we have left to learn from nature.”\n\nBolstad also noted the presence of large rusty red brown chromatophores, or color-changing cells, on the squid’s mantle.\n\n“(That) tells us that it almost certainly can switch back and forth between being completely transparent, which is how we see it, mostly in this footage, to being quite opaque,” Bolstad said. “And it probably has fine control over whether it can do that in certain regions of the body as well, which, again, we would have hypothesized, but we don’t know for sure until we see this animal.”\n\nBolstad noted that an organization called Colossal captured footage of a glass squid of a similar size in the Antarctic in the organization’s 2023-2024 observing campaign, but the lack of high-resolution footage made it impossible to distinguish which squid species it belonged to because its features weren’t discernible.\n\nBolstad clarified that the colossal squid is not the same as the giant squid. While the colossal squid lives exclusively in the Antarctic and sub-Antarctic regions, the giant squid is found in other oceans of the world.\n\nDuring a separate expedition near Antarctica in January, Dr. Thom Linley was on board as the team examined the seafloor after a Chicago-size iceberg broke away from the George VI Ice Shelf.\n\nLinley, curator of fishes at the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa, was in the ship’s control room as the Falkor (too) deployed a remotely operated vehicle through the depths of the Bellingshausen Sea when he saw something intriguing as SuBastian reached 2,254 feet (687 meters).\n\nA glass squid floated into view, and Linley asked if the vehicle could pause during descent to capture footage.\n\n“I know it’s a cute little squid, but this might be important,” Linley recalled saying. He shared the high-resolution footage with Bolstad. Evans was also brought in to review the imagery.\n\nThe juvenile colossal squid and the glacial glass squid, called Galiteuthis glacialis, appear similar, with both having hooks at the end of their two longer tentacles and transparent bodies.\n\nBut this particular glass squid observed during the descent held its arms loosely above its head in a maneuver called a cockatoo pose, which has been observed previously in glass squids.\n\nTogether, Bolstad and Evans were able to confirm that they were seeing a glacial glass squid in its frigid, deep environment for the first time.\n\nNeither of the squid observed in the footage disappear or appear alarmed by presence of the remotely operated vehicle. Instead, they appear to hold their positions calmly, assessing if the vehicle is a threat.\n\nBut an adult colossal squid remains elusive, using its sensitive vision to avoid anything that may pose a risk.\n\n“From their perspective, any time something large is coming forward, it’s not a good thing,” Evans said. “The adult colossal squid remains mysterious and enigmatic because it has these senses, which allow it to see us. The colossal squid is limited to Antarctica, where we don’t get the opportunity to research quite as frequently. So, it’s going to take us a bit longer for us to have that chance encounter where we get it on film.”\n\nThe research vessel won’t be returning to Antarctica until 2028, but it will be operating in the South Atlantic Ocean off the coasts of Argentina and Uruguay over the next four years, the Schmidt Ocean Institute’s Virmani said. The vehicle’s dives are streamed live on the institute’s YouTube channel so anyone can follow along with its expeditions to the deep, she said.\n\n“Now that we have the ability to share (dives) in real time in this way and show people how beautiful the things are, how many things remain to be discovered, and that people can come along with us as we make these discoveries, I feel like our ability to appreciate the deep sea on a much wider scale is moving towards where it should have been all along,” Bolstad said.', 'A colossal find', 'Updated 4:46 PM EDT, Wed April 16, 2025', 'colossal-squid-resembles-a-glass-sculpture-in-first-footage-taken-from-the-deep-sea-1745765219'),

A juvenile salmon is shown in May 2019.', 'Hatched in quiet streams and rivers, salmon undertake a perilous journey to reach the open ocean where they become mature adults. Over millions of years, generations of young salmon have migrated great distances, in some cases traveling hundreds of miles from freshwater systems to the sea. However, modern salmon face a hurdle that was unknown to their ancient ancestors: pharmaceutical pollution that changes their migration behavior.\n\nRecently, researchers discovered that when a drug called clobazam accumulates in salmon’s brains, migrating fish reach the ocean sooner and navigate dam obstacles faster. On the surface, this change might seem helpful to salmon. However, any deviation from normal animal behavior through human activity — particularly when psychoactive substances are involved — is a red flag, and the full extent of how drug pollution may alter salmon health, behavior and reproduction is still unknown, scientists reported April 10 in the journal Science.\n\nClobazam, which is commonly found in wastewater, belongs to a group of medicines called benzodiazepines, which depress the central nervous system. The drug is used to prevent epileptic seizures, for short-term treatment of anxiety and to treat anxiety-related sleep disorders. But because neural wiring in fish resembles that of mammals, fish are highly susceptible to the effects of drugs that tweak human neurochemistry, said Dr. Christopher C. Caudill, a professor in the department of fish and wildlife sciences at the University of Idaho.\n\n“Humans share a large amount of biological architecture with fishes — our physiology and anatomy are remarkably similar. Thus, it is intuitive that psychoactive drugs alter the behavior of both fishes and humans,” Caudill, who was not involved in the research, told CNN in an email.\n\nPrior research showed that benzodiazepines could alter behavior in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), but they did so under conditions unlike those experienced by wild salmon, said study coauthor Dr. Marcus Michelangeli, a lecturer in the School of Environment and Science at Griffith University in Queensland, Australia.\n\n“Those studies were largely conducted in laboratory settings, only tracked movement over short distances — less than 100 metres (328 feet) — or used drug concentrations much higher than what salmon would typically encounter in the wild,” Michelangeli said via email.\n\n“Our study took a different approach. We followed the entire river-to-sea migration of juvenile salmon in a natural river system, using drug concentrations that match what fish are actually exposed to in the environment.”\n\nThe field investigation’s findings highlight the growing risks pharmaceutical pollutants pose to wildlife populations across the globe, according to Michelangeli.\n\nFor the new study, the scientists performed trials with more than 700 young salmon, or “smolts,” in the laboratory and in the field. The research team used sound-transmitting tags to remotely track hundreds of smolts in 2020 and 2021 as the fish navigated the Dal River in central Sweden.\n\nMigrating smolts swim downriver into a reservoir, hurtle over rapids and crest two dams before finally reaching the Baltic Sea. The journey takes 10 to 13 days.\n\nTwo major classes of pharmaceuticals — benzodiazepines and opioids — “are commonly detected in rivers and streams worldwide, including in Sweden, where our study was conducted,” Michelangeli said.\n\nTime-release implants in the smolts dispensed two drugs from these classes: clobazam and tramadol. Fish received clobazam, or tramadol, or both. A control group of smolts received implants with no drugs in them at all.\n\n“These two drugs are known to interact chemically when taken together in humans, and they often co-occur in the environment,” Michelangeli said. “This made them a good test case to explore how pharmaceutical mixtures might affect animal behaviour.”\n\nAlong with the field trials, the scientists ran a laboratory-based study on 256 smolts to confirm that the implants worked as intended and that the drugs were lingering in the fishes’ bodily tissues and brains.\n\nWhen the researchers tracked the migrating salmon with transmitters, they found that more clobazam-exposed salmon reached the Baltic than any of the other fish. Compared with the control group, more than twice as many salmon with clobazam implants made it to the sea.\n\nLab experiments showed that clobazam affected shoaling behavior, in which smolts stick close together to evade predators. Under the influence of clobazam, fish swam farther apart even when a predator was near, “suggesting that the drug may reduce natural fear responses,” Michelangeli said.\n\nFish with clobazam implants were also faster at getting past two hydropower dams along their migration route — about two to eight times faster than fish in the other groups. These dams are notorious death zones, where churning turbines can swiftly reduce smolts to salmon tartare.\n\nBy diminishing fear in smolts, clobazam might briefly benefit the fish by boosting their migration success. But the drug could also increase their vulnerability to ocean predators, decreasing their chances of surviving long enough to return home to spawn, Caudill said.\n\n“The transition from freshwater to saltwater is one of the most dangerous times in the life of a salmon because they experience many new predators in the ocean,” he said. Drug-exposed and risk-taking salmon may be more likely to reach the Baltic, but less likely to ever leave it alive.\n\nCaudill’s research investigates how environmental change affects fish ecology and evolution. In future work, he said, “I do plan to consider the potential for behavioral effects from pharmaceutical pollution.”\n\nFurther study will clarify how behavioral changes from drug pollution affect long-term survival, reproduction and how populations change over time — in salmon and in other wildlife that are vulnerable to pharmaceutical contaminants.\n\n“While more drug-exposed salmon may reach the sea, it doesn’t mean they’re healthy or that the population benefits in the long term,” Michelangeli said.\n\n“The bottom line is we need to be cautious with this interpretation. Changing behaviour with pharmaceuticals — even unintentionally — could reshape whole populations in ways we don’t yet understand.”', 'Just keep swimming', 'Updated 12:08 PM EDT, Wed April 16, 2025', 'salmon-migration-affected-by-drug-pollution-in-water-from-antianxiety-medication-1745765219'),

Scientists offer new clues', 'https://edition.cnn.com/2025/04/11/science/dinosaur-fossils-extinction-study/index.html', 'Katie Hunt', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/late-cretaceous-floodplain.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_833,w_1480,c_fill', 'Shown here is an artist\'s reconstruction of what the North American environment may have looked like 66 million years ago.', 'It’s a long-standing debate in paleontology: Were dinosaurs thriving when an asteroid hit Earth one fateful spring day 66 million years ago, or were they already on their way out, and the space rock delivered a final, devastating blow?\n\nTo find answers, a team of researchers studied North America’s fossil record, focusing on the 18 million years before the mass extinction at the end of the Cretaceous period. The new analysis, published Tuesday in the journal Current Biology, adds to a growing body of evidence that the dinosaurs were doing just fine before the asteroid’s deadly impact.\n\nHowever, at face value, the fossils available for study from this time — more than 8,000 — suggest the number of dinosaur species peaked about 75 million years ago and then declined in the 9 million years leading up to the asteroid strike.\n\n“It comes down to the fossil record and its fidelity, or its quality. And so there’s been an awareness since the 1970s that the fossil record is not accurate, but it is a biased reflection in the past,” said lead study author Chris Dean, a research fellow in paleontology at University College London.\n\n“It’s only in very recent years that we’ve started to see the full extent of (the bias issue), when using these large databases of fossil occurrences,” he said.\n\nTo understand better what was going on at the time of the dinosaurs’ demise, Dean and his colleagues turned to a statistical approach called occupancy modeling to estimate the probability of a dinosaur being present at a site. Used in present-day ecology and conservation, occupancy modeling aims to account for the fact that a species may be overlooked or not detected even when present in a particular area. This study marks the first time the approach has been used to look at dinosaurs and over a large scale, Dean said.\n\n“Applying a new technique is really hard,” Dean noted. “I don’t think it will be the last word. I’m sure there’s a lot more to be said.”\n\nFor the new study, the researchers looked at four main dinosaur families: Ankylosauridae (armored plant-eating dinosaurs such as the club-tailed Ankylosaurus), Ceratopsidae (large three-horned herbivores including Triceratops), Hadrosauridae (duck-billed dinosaurs), and Tyrannosauridae (carnivores such as Tyrannosaurus rex).\n\n“We looked at these bigger groupings so we could have more data, effectively,” Dean said. “We gridded up North America into a big spatial grid (and determined) the places where we can find fossils, (the places where we) have physically found fossils and how many times people have gone to look for fossils (in these places).”\n\nThe information was fed into a computer model, and Dean and his colleagues compared the physical fossil record with that proposed by the model and found a mismatch.\n\nThe model suggested that, during the 18 million-year time period in question, the proportion of land the four dinosaur clades likely occupied remained constant overall, suggesting their potential habitat area remained stable, and the risk of extinction stayed low.\n\nOne of the factors that could have clouded the true diversity patterns of dinosaurs was the lack of rock exposed at the Earth’s surface during that window of time — and thus available for fossil hunters today to scrutinize.\n\n“In this study, we show that this apparent decline is more likely a result of a reduced sampling window, caused by geological changes in these terminal Mesozoic fossil-bearing layers — driven by processes such as tectonics, mountain uplift, and sea-level retreat — rather than genuine fluctuations in biodiversity,” said study coauthor Alfio Alessandro Chiarenza, a Royal Society Newton International Fellow at University College London’s department of Earth sciences, in a statement.\n\n“Dinosaurs were probably not inevitably doomed to extinction at the end of the Mesozoic,” Chiarenza said. “If it weren’t for that asteroid, they might still share this planet with mammals, lizards, and their surviving descendants: birds.”\n\nThe study helped to highlight what biases may affect scientists’ understanding of the true pattern of dinosaur diversity leading up to the extinction event, said Darla Zelenitsky, a paleontologist at the University of Calgary in Alberta who wasn’t involved in the research.\n\n“Because of the nature of the rock record, (paleontologists have) found it was more difficult to detect dinosaurs and thus understand their diversity patterns in that window of time just before the mass extinction,” she said.\n\n“It certainly makes sense as we know there are biases related to the rock record that can obscure true biological patterns. The more rock that is exposed at the surface (today), the better our chance of finding dinosaurs in that rock, which in turn leads to a better understanding of their diversity patterns.”\n\nMike Benton, a professor of vertebrate paleontology at the UK’s University of Bristol, called the paper “thorough and detailed” but said it doesn’t prove there was no reduction in dinosaur diversity ahead of the extinction event. Benton’s work has suggested that dinosaurs were in decline before the asteroid wiped them out. He wasn’t involved in the new study.\n\n“The current paper suggests that the ‘reduction’ can be explained as a statistical artefact,” Benton said via email. “What it shows is … simply that the reduction could be real or could be explained by reduced sampling, in my opinion.”', 'Filling in fossil record gaps', 'Updated 2:33 PM EDT, Fri April 11, 2025', 'were-dinosaurs-headed-for-extinction-even-before-massive-asteroid-strike-scientists-offer-new-clues-1745765219'),

This rare fossilization process allowed researchers to examine the species’ structural features, including its soft tissue, stomach and coloration patterns.\n\n“Every time I have a detailed look at a fossil from McGraths Flat, I am amazed by its detailed preservation,” study coauthor Dr. Michael Frese, associate professor and virologist at the University of Canberra, said via email. “It’s very surprising, (and) it’s extremely rare to be able to tell the colour of a fossil fish like this.”\n\nBeyond identifying a newfound species, researchers uncovered the first detailed evidence of Osmeriformes, a group that includes modern-day graylings and smelts, in Australia.\n\nUntil now, scientists could only speculate when smelts first arrived on the continent due to a lack of fossil evidence, but this new finding offers crucial insights into the region’s ancient ecosystem, Frese said.\n\nUsing high-powered microscopes, paleontologists analyzed the stomach contents and intestinal tract of F. brocksi and found the fish primarily fed on various types of phantom midge larvae — an almost transparent insect larvae — along with insect wings and even a small bivalve, or a mollusk with hinged shells.\n\n“Knowing their diet helps us start to paint a picture of food chains and food webs in the original environments,” said Dr. Anthony Martin, a professor of practice in the department of environmental sciences at Emory University in Atlanta, who was not involved in the study.\n\nOne specimen of fish had a freshwater mussel attached to its tail fin. The finding is rare because the lake sediments where F. brocksi were found wouldn’t have supported an environment for the bivalve to reach sexual maturity and produce glochidia — the larval, parasitic stage of some freshwater mussels, Frese said. He added that it’s likely the parasites infected the fish in a nearby river, suggesting a connection between the fossil site and a neighboring waterway.\n\nThe stomach contents not only helped paleontologists identify what the fish were eating but also when they were feeding.\n\n“Many extant species of Chaoborus (phantom midge larvae) do not occur in lakes with fishes, and those that do co-exist with fishes often conduct a diurnal migration to avoid predatory fishes during the daytime,” Frese said.\n\n“As most Chaoborus larvae spent most of the day in the sediment, hiding from pelagic predators, F. brocksi would likely have preyed on Chaoborus at night.”\n\nOne of the most surprising discoveries was the presence of melanophores or pigmented cells, offering insight into the fish’s coloration.\n\nThe fossils revealed F. brocksi had a slender body, similar to modern-day smelts. The fish also presented evidence of countershading, in which the animal was darker on the top and lighter on its stomach, with two stripes running along the length of its body, according to the study.\n\nFrese noted that this coloration pattern may indicate a shoaling behavior, in which fish gather in loose social groups. The countershading also likely helped the species evade predators from above, Martin added.\n\nWhile central New South Wales is now characterized by plains and plateaus, during the Miocene, the region was surrounded by lush rainforests, according to the study. The discovery of F. brocksi west of the Great Dividing Range suggests that, unlike most surviving Osmeriformes, this species may have spent its entire life in freshwater, according to the study.\n\n“While this study is focused on one species of fish,” Frese said, “it is part of a broader ecosystem that we are piecing together by excavating fossils from the site.”', '', 'Published 2:28 PM EDT, Fri March 28, 2025', 'fossilized-fish-up-to-16-million-years-old-found-in-australia-with-last-meal-still-intact-1745765219'),

The previously unknown species, now named Sirenobethylus charybdis, had a Venus flytrap-like structure on its abdomen that could have allowed it to trap other insects, the researchers reported Thursday in the journal BMC Biology.\n\n“When I looked at the first specimen, I noticed this expansion at the tip of the abdomen, and I thought this must be an air bubble. It’s quite often you see air bubbles around specimens in amber,” said study coauthor Lars Vilhelmsen, a wasp expert and curator at the Natural History Museum of Denmark in Copenhagen.\n\n“But then I looked at a few more specimens and then went back to the first one. This was actually part of the animal.”\n\nVilhelmsen and his colleagues from Capital Normal University in Beijing determined the structure was movable because it was preserved in different positions on different specimens.\n\n“Sometimes the lower flap, as we call it, is open, and sometimes it’s closed,” Vilhelmsen said. “It was clearly a movable structure and something that was used to grasp something.”\n\nThe closest comparison found in nature today is the Venus flytrap, a carnivorous plant with hinged leaves that snap shut when prey flies inside, according to the new study.\n\n“There’s no way you can know how an insect that died 100 million years ago was living. So you look for analogs in modern insect fauna. Do we have anything among wasps or other groups that looks like this?” he said.\n\n“And there’s no real analog within insects. We had to go all the way out of the animal kingdom into the plant kingdom to find something that remotely resembled this.”\n\nHowever, the researchers reasoned that the wasp likely did not intend to kill with the bizarre grasping structure.\n\nInstead, they theorized that the wasp injected eggs into the trapped body before releasing it, using the creature as an unwitting host for its eggs. Its larvae then started their lives as parasites in or on the host’s body and likely ended up eating the host entirely, Vilhelmsen said. The host was likely a flying insect of a similar size to the wasp, he added.\n\nSimilar, although not identical behavior has been observed among living parasitoid wasp species. For example, a group of wasps known as cuckoo wasps lay their eggs in the nest of another wasp species, and the larvae feast on their new hosts’ young once they hatch.\n\nAmber fossils offer a tantalizing, three-dimensional look at the distant past. Besides plants and flowers, a dinosaur tail, a crab, a hell ant, a spider mom and her young, and a firefly have been found entombed in globs of tree resin.\n\nA fossil enthusiast purchased the amber containing Sirenobethylus charybdis, which came from Myanmar’s Kachin region near the border with China, several years ago and donated it to Capital Normal University’s Key Laboratory of Insect Evolution and Environmental Changes in 2016, the authors said.\n\nAmber fossils have been some of paleontology’s most exciting finds in recent years, but ethical concerns about the provenance of amber from the region have emerged, with some paleontologists calling for a moratorium on research on amber sourced from Myanmar following a 2021 military coup.\n\nThe “Cretaceous weirdo” Sirenobethylus charybdis adds to a growing list of insects from that time that “had adaptations that are outside of the bounds of the critters that are alive today,” said Phil Barden, an associate professor at the New Jersey Institute of Technology who has worked with amber fossils.\n\n“This is significant because there are around a million known insect species — even with all of that living diversity, there are still lots of unexpected surprises in the fossil record that are beyond imagination,” Barden, who was not involved in the study, said via email.\n\nHowever, he said, while plausible, the flytrap hypothesis is “a bit speculative.”\n\n“There appears to be clear evidence that the abdominal components would have had range of motion. There are also a number of setae, or hairs, that look to be in the right position to detect hosts and potentially immobilize them,” Barden said.\n\nHe said it is possible the biological structures might have had another purpose such as detecting prey in soil or perhaps even for transporting baby wasps.\n\n“Today, thousands of parasitoid wasp species are capable of immobilizing hosts without abdominal clasping. Why were these wasps unable to simply rely on their stings or incorporate their mouthparts into host capture as living species do?” Barden asked.\n\nVilhelmsen said a key factor in his colleagues’ interpretation of the fossil was the location of the wasp’s egg-laying organ — right next to the trap-like structure. However, all the Sirenobethylus charybdis specimens examined so far are female wasps, and so the researchers weren’t able to rule out that the structure could have played a role during mating, according to the study.\n\n“This is something unique, something I never expected to see, and something I couldn’t even imagine would be found,” Vilhelmsen said. “It’s a 10 out of 10.”', '‘Cretaceous weirdo’', 'Updated 12:41 PM EDT, Thu March 27, 2025', 'bizarre-creature-preserved-in-99-millionyearold-amber-was-beyond-imagination-scientists-say-1745765219'),

Alfredo “Freddy” González are part of an exhibit at the Museum of South Texas History in Edinburg, Texas.', 'Patriotism runs deep in this South Texas town nestled just along the border with Mexico. American flags fly outside many businesses. Pictures of veterans adorn light poles and traffic signal boxes. And a giant mural inside a popular grocery store depicts a hero you can’t help but notice: Alfredo “Freddy” González.\n\nGonzález was a United States Marine Corps sergeant from Edinburg, Texas, who joined the military in the late 1960s and was killed in action during the Vietnam War. In this southernmost region of Texas, known as the Rio Grande Valley, he is the namesake of a main thoroughfare, a park and an elementary school. Outside this area, his name has graced a US Navy warship for 30 years and, until recently, he had been featured among Hispanic veterans on the Naval History and Heritage Command website.\n\nLike González’s contributions, those made by women, LGBTQ+ individuals, people of color and historical figures are at the center of the Trump administration’s purge of diversity, equity and inclusion-related content from government websites.\n\nSome content on the Naval History and Heritage Command website has been “moved to align with Department of Defense guidance and recent Executive Orders,” a spokesperson for the command told CNN earlier this month.\n\n“This is a grave disrespect to Sgt. González’s memory and a punch to the gut for South Texas and all of our service members. Has the President no shame?,” Democratic Rep. Vicente Gonzalez of Texas said in a statement last month about Gonzalez’s removal from a section on the website highlighting Hispanic veterans.\n\nWhile González’s name and contributions may have been removed from some digital realms, in the physical world – most importantly in Edinburg – community members inspired by his mother, fellow veterans and students are keeping his legacy alive.\n\nGonzález was born in Edinburg in 1946. During his teenage years, he played football and worked in the fields picking cotton.\n\n“He was probably the smallest lineman, offensive lineman, in the football team but he probably was the toughest,” his childhood friend Pete Vela said in a 2023 documentary.\n\nWhen González graduated high school in 1965, he joined the US Marine Corps and served two tours fighting in Vietnam. He often corresponded with his mother during his time overseas, checking in on her and wanting to know how his friends and family in Edinburg were doing.\n\nHe served his country as well as those around him. In Vietnam, González risked his life to bring an injured Marine to safety, and later stepped in the line of fire to direct enemy troops away from his platoon.\n\nA letter dated January 24, 1968 to González’s mother offers a glimpse of how the soldier chose to live a life of service. In his missive, González wrote about a friend who was killed and how he hoped people understood what the loss meant.\n\n“Mother, I was shocked to hear that Victor got killed, but it’s things that will happen in war,” González wrote.\n\n“I hope all the people back home remember Victor, cause he didn’t give his life for nothing. It was in the line of duty. His life was given willing, rather than taken. That’s the way I want you to think,” González added.\n\nMany believe he was preparing his mother for what would likely become his fate.\n\nGonzález died 11 days later on February 4, 1968 after he was wounded trying to save his fellow Marines during the Battle of Hue, a major clash at the old imperial capital that was considered one of the Vietnam War’s defining moments.\n\nIn his final act of heroism, González moved fearlessly from numerous firing positions as his unit was pinned down by intense incoming fire to destroy an enemy rocket position and successfully suppressed hostile bombardment — actions that protected his fellow Marines but left him fatally wounded. He was 21 years old.\n\nHis mother, Dolia González, turned her grief into a life’s mission, becoming the keeper and teller of her son’s story. When you go around Edinburg asking about González, everyone quickly brings her up.\n\n“It was the love and the memory of her son that was Dolia’s identity, and it was enduring,” said Francisco Guajardo, CEO of the Museum of South Texas History, which has a permanent exhibit dedicated to González featuring his uniform and posthumous decorations and medals, including a Purple Heart and the Medal of Honor.\n\nDolia González was “almost like the mother of the community,” Guajardo said, noting that she helped numerous families cope and heal after losing children in the Vietnam War.\n\nMore than 50 years since his passing, Freddy González’s voice echoes throughout the Museum of South Texas History with words for his mom who waited for him in his beloved hometown.\n\n“My mother is Dolia González,” the sergeant said, adding his full address.\n\n“Is there anything you would like to say to her this Christmas time?” a man is heard asking him.\n\n“Merry Christmas and Happy New Year,” González replies as loud noises are heard in the background.\n\nThe audio was recorded in December of 1967, weeks before González was killed. The other man is a DJ from a local radio station who traveled to Vietnam to meet soldiers and recorded their holiday messages.\n\nGonzález penned more than 150 letters﻿ for his mother and even asked her to listen to the radio station for a surprise.\n\nAt bedtime, Dolia González read and cherished those letters, Guajardo said, until one day she donated them to the museum.\n\n“It is what has kept me alive,” Guajardo recalled her saying in 2020 when she handed him the letters. “…But I’m all out of tears, and I’m afraid that the letters are going to get lost, so you take them.”\n\nAbout 3 miles southwest from the museum is Freddy Gonzalez Elementary. Inside the single-story building, many children have learned about González’s bravery and the importance of serving in the military.\n\n“Sgt. Alfredo Gonzalez is a true role model the students can look up to,” said Naida N. Torres, the school’s principal. “He exemplified bravery, honor, duty and sacrifice.”\n\nThere are about 525 students enrolled at the school and the majority of them are Hispanic, according to the latest data released by the National Center for Education Statistics.\n\nFor the 50th anniversary of González’s death, students stood outside of the school wearing red, white or blue T-shirts to form an American flag. They sang “God Bless the USA” when some of the military’s top brass filled the school’s gymnasium in 2019 to present González’s mother with the Medal of Honor flag. And they’ve met some of the veterans who served with González.\n\n“‘First, we don’t know him as Freddy, he is Sgt. Alfredo Gonzalez and second, I wouldn’t be here today if it wasn’t for him’,” Torres recalled the veterans told students after a 2018 ceremony marking the 50th death anniversary of González.\n\nGonzález’s presence and relevance in the school goes beyond simply being a namesake or having a memorial in the office with his uniform, military flag and certificates of recognition.\n\nInstead of having an animal as a mascot, students see the USS Gonzalez, the Navy destroyer homeported more than 1,600 miles away in Virginia and named after the sergeant, as the symbol unifying their school community.\n\nThe bond between the elementary school and the battleship is so unique that the ship’s crew has traveled to Edinburg to meet with students and have a Texas flag from the school on display at the USS Gonzalez.\n\nBefore being sent to its new home, the flag was raised next to the school’s memorial garden that features a large marble stone with the names of soldiers from Edinburg who “gave their lives for our country,” Torres said.\n\n“Over 500 students and staff surrounded the pole with their hands over their hearts as the flag was raised to the top (of the flagpole),” the principal added.\n\nOn any given night, a number of veterans who attended school in Edinburg with González and other service members get together at the American Legion Alfredo Gonzalez Post 408.\n\nWhile they enjoy singing on karaoke nights, dancing or playing the Mexican bingo-style game of lotería together, the veterans are the proudest when they have a chance to honor González’s memory and support their community, several post members told CNN.\n\n“(H)is memory is alive and we want to keep it alive by everything that we do, in everything that we do when we go out and represent the American Legion,” said Claudia Noyola, a retired Army veteran and finance officer of the post’s executive committee. “We’re not just representing ourselves. We’re representing Freddy González, his sacrifice. He’s the hero.”\n\nGeorge Rabago, a Marine veteran and another member of the post’s executive committee, said he is involved with the post because he doesn’t want González or the group’s memory to disappear.\n\nOne of the reasons Rabago joined the post was “to follow the path of the older generation. And you know, hopefully carry the name of Freddy González until then, until the next generation comes in,” he said.\n\nBut they are not passively waiting for a younger generation to take over. Noyola, was a JROTC instructor at Edinburg High School and next month, the post will host its annual Freddy Gonzalez 5K, which helps them raise funds for scholarships.\n\nWhen asked about González’s contributions being removed from the Naval history webpage featuring Hispanic veterans, Noyola said she doubts it will change how Edinburg celebrates González.\n\n“Everyone is so proud of our veterans, and so regardless of what’s going on with the current administration, nothing’s going to change here in Edinburg.” Noyola said. “We will never erase any memory. Websites can come and go. We will always honor Freddy González and his legacy and his mother, Dolia González, for everything that she did.”\n\nSehila Mota Casper, the executive director of Latinos in Heritage Conservation, a non-profit advocating for preserving the cultural history, places and stories of Latinos in the US, said the Trump administration’s efforts around DEI are “detrimental to Latinx, BIPOC and underrepresented communities,” further inequality and damage the visibility of Latinos.\n\n“I think it’s a moment where we all need to stand up and speak out,” Casper said. “We need to all collectively say that this is not okay, that you’re erasing our history.”\n\nGonzález’s biography is currently listed on government websites related to his Medal of Honor and the USS Gonzalez.\n\nAfter grieving González for more than 56 years, his mother died last year at the age of 94.\n\nTogether, the veterans in Edinburg, the museum staff, students and many people who crossed paths with her said they are carrying on her mission in their own ways.

The mother, who has lived in south Louisiana for more than a decade but did not have lawful status, was asked to bring the two children and their passports to the appointment, Hebert told CNN Sunday.\n\nOn their arrival, however, Hebert said she was not allowed to accompany the family to the meeting. About 20 to 30 minutes later, Hebert was informed the family had been detained, but officials refused to tell her where they were taken.\n\nHebert later learned after speaking with her client, two ICE officers were waiting for the family at the appointment, she told CNN.\n\nHebert then went to ICE’s New Orleans field office, where she said she filed a stay of removal she had prepared in advance of her client’s meeting, hoping to keep them in the country. Over the course of the day, she repeatedly contacted the office to ask where they were being held but said she was not given a response.\n\nEarly Friday morning, the family was placed on a plane, Hebert said, and taken to Honduras.\n\n“My clients were deported within 24 hours of being detained with no access to me,” Hebert said.\n\nAccording to Willis, both women had removal orders issued in their absence, meaning they had missed a court proceeding about their immigration cases and a judge subsequently issued a deportation order.\n\n“Something prevented them from being present at one single court date,” Willis said, “and because of that, the judge entered an order of deportation for them.”\n\nIn court filings, the government said the mother of the 2-year-old had requested to take her child with her to Honduras, citing a handwritten note purportedly written by the mother in Spanish. Trump border czar Tom Homan and Secretary of State Marco Rubio both echoed the claim in interviews Sunday morning.\n\n“If someone’s in this country unlawfully, illegally, that person gets deported. If that person is with a 2-year-old child, or has a 2-year-old child and says, ‘I want to take my child … with me,’ well then … you have two choices,” Rubio said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”\n\n“You can say, yes, of course. You can take your child, whether they’re a citizen or not, because it’s your child,” Rubio said, “or you can say, yes, you can go, but your child must stay behind.”\n\nWillis, however, rejected the suggestion that V.M.L.’s mother, who is also pregnant, wanted to take her child to Honduras. The handwritten note, she said, “is not a statement of desire.”\n\nWillis denied either mother was given a choice, telling CNN Sunday both wanted their children to remain in the United States. The 4-year-old, for instance, was still receiving cancer treatment, Willis noted. Additionally, both women had family in the United States, according to Willis and Hebert.\n\n“These are mothers, these are pregnant women. These are children,” Alanah Odoms, the executive director of the ACLU of Louisiana told CNN Sunday. “These are people with terminally ill or very serious medical conditions who were law-abiding residents, who were checking in with ICE as they had been instructed to do under orders of supervision.”\n\n“If ICE can do this to these mothers and these children, if ICE can do this to students on college campuses … none of us are safe from this kind of lawlessness,” she said.', 'Attorney disputes government claim of handwritten note', 'Published 4:50 PM EDT, Sun April 27, 2025', '3-children-who-are-us-citizens-including-one-with-cancer-deported-with-their-mothers-lawyers-and-advocacy-groups-say-1745804464'),

Ron DeSantis hailed the operation as “an example of FL and (the Department of Homeland Security) partnering to deliver big results on immigration enforcement and deportations,” according to a statement on X.\n\n“Florida is leading the nation in active cooperation with the Trump administration for immigration enforcement and deportation operations!” DeSantis wrote in a separate post Saturday.\n\nThe massive number of reported arrests comes amid President Donald Trump’s ongoing crackdown on illegal immigration and as the Department of Justice moves to prosecute state and local officials accused of impeding that effort.\n\nDeSantis and other Republican leaders in Florida have pushed local officials in the state to sign agreements with ICE under the 287(g) Program, which allows local authorities to be trained by and partner with ICE to enforce aspects of US immigration law. Florida leaders have warned that state law allows for the removal of officials who refuse to cooperate with the federal government’s immigration efforts.\n\nStatewide agencies, including the Florida Highway Patrol, the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, the Florida State Guard, the Florida Department of Agricultural Law Enforcement and the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, all signed collaboration agreements with ICE, according to an announcement by DeSantis in February.\n\nIn all, more than 200 state, county and municipal law enforcement agencies across Florida have entered into collaboration agreements with ICE, and more than 70 others have agreements pending, according to data from the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nEarlier this month, multiple universities in Florida announced their campus police also signed the ICE agreements, further stoking fears among international students amid the Trump administration’s revocation of hundreds of student visas at colleges across the US.\n\nLocal leaders in several parts of Florida approved cooperation agreements with ICE while expressing opposition to it.\n\nThe city council in the Miami suburb of Doral – which has the largest Venezuelan immigrant population in the country – voted unanimously to approve an ICE collaboration agreement earlier this month, but council members made clear they were required to do so under state law.\n\n“We’re being mandated by the state to take certain actions and if we don’t, we’re being threatened with criminal penalties,” City Attorney Lorenzo Cobiella said. “Passing this is painful for all of us. We’re all immigrants … we all have families that derive from different places where, right now, there’s great suffering.”\n\nThomas Kennedy, spokesperson for the Florida Immigrant Coalition, characterized the operation as “part of this longstanding effort by state government to basically force local police departments to conduct immigration enforcement.”\n\n“These police officers became police officers to be police officers, not immigration agents,” he told CNN Sunday. “They should be out there policing the highways, not terrorizing undocumented people that are just trying to live in the state of Florida, pay taxes and work.”\n\nHe added he thinks the flurry of arrests is part of an effort to “create fear” so that undocumented immigrants self-deport.\n\nThe immigration crackdown will “create a less friendly, less welcoming, more prosecutory state,” Kennedy said, “where worker shortages increase, where communities are less safe because they’re afraid to report crime, where police departments are overburdened, doing work that they shouldn’t be doing.”\n\nLast month, Fort Myers City Council members voted against the ICE collaboration, only to backtrack and approve it after Florida’s attorney general sent them a letter warning that the governor could remove them from office. Attorney General James Uthmeier called the initial refusal a “serious and direct violation” of Florida law that bans “sanctuary cities.”\n\nThe US Justice Department has repeatedly asserted that it will investigate any local officials who do not assist federal authorities on immigration matters.\n\nLast week, Hannah Dugan, a Milwaukee County Circuit judge, was arrested by the FBI and charged in federal court for allegedly helping an undocumented immigrant avoid arrest. She made an initial appearance in court and was later released.\n\nIn court Friday, Dugan’s attorney said, “Judge Dugan wholeheartedly regrets and protests her arrest. It was not made in the interest of public safety,” according to the AP.\n\nAlso last week, former New Mexico magistrate judge Joel Cano and his wife, Nancy Cano, were accused of tampering with evidence linked to the arrest of an undocumented migrant suspected of being a member of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua, according to two criminal complaints.\n\nThe migrant, Cristhian Ortega-Lopez, is a Venezuelan who was charged earlier this year for unlawful possession of a firearm or ammunition, court documents show.', 'Pressure to cooperate', 'Updated 3:41 PM EDT, Sun April 27, 2025', 'ice-firstofitskind-operation-with-local-law-enforcement-leads-to-nearly-800-immigrant-arrests-in-florida-1745804464');

(Greg Derr/The Patriot Ledger via AP, Pool)', 'In a courtroom where every word is scrutinized, defense attorneys say “the right to remain silent” is golden.\n\nKaren Read did not testify in her first trial in the death of John O’Keefe, but comments she made to media outlets and in a recent documentary have already been presented this week to the jury in her retrial on murder and manslaughter charges.\n\nAnd prosecutors are taking advantage.\n\nThat kind of public presence is something that some defense attorneys say could tip the scales of a case. Misty Marris, a defense attorney and co-managing partner of the Gordon Rees Scully Mansukhani’s New York office, said a defendant’s right to remain silent is important. It’s intended to protect them from incriminating themselves on the stand, she said.\n\n“You blow that up a little bit if you make a lot of extrajudicial statements because all of a sudden there’s a lot of stuff out there that the jury would never hear and that, is in every case, a risk,” Marris told CNN.\n\nRead’s attorneys are not the first ones to face this problem. In recent years, public comments made by Robert Durst and Sam Bankman-Fried also came up in their high-profile cases.\n\nRead was tried for second-degree murder and other charges last year in O’Keefe’s death, but a mistrial was declared due to a hung jury.\n\nLast month, Investigation Discovery released a five-part documentary series “A Body in the Snow: The Trial of Karen Read” featuring interviews with Read and her defense attorneys before, during, and after the first trial. Investigation Discovery, like CNN, is owned by Warner Bros. Discovery.\n\nIn the documentary, Read denied the accusations against her. Prosecutors have alleged a drunken Read struck O’Keefe with her vehicle and then fled, leaving him to die in the cold snow.\n\n“I did not drive my car into John. Didn’t reverse it. Did not hit John with my car,” Read said. “There is zero chance this is an accident. There is zero chance John was hit by a vehicle.”\n\nBut in other clips, like in an October 2024 interview with NBC’s Dateline, Read appears to entertain the possibility that she did strike O’Keefe: “Could I have clipped him? Could I have tagged him in the knee and incapacitated him? He didn’t look mortally wounded, as far as I could see. Could I have done something that knocked him out, and in his drunkenness and in the cold, he didn’t come to again?”\n\nSpecial Prosecutor Hank Brennan played the clip during his opening statements this week and told the jury they would “hear from her own lips in many of her statements, her admissions” on things like how intoxicated she was, what happened with her car and her feelings toward O’Keefe at the time.\n\nRead’s public comments didn’t end there. During jury selection Judge Beverly Cannone imposed a gag order on all attorneys — but not on Read, who told reporters outside the courthouse Tuesday that she felt the first day of the trial “went well.”\n\nBefore the trial began, prosecutors told the court they intend to use interviews Read has done with media outlets in their case. In court on March 18, Brennan argued that some of her statements in “A Body in the Snow” presented new information, for example, Read saying that she watched O’Keefe get out of the car and go into the house that night.\n\nThis is one of the pitfalls defendants can fall into when they make public statements during or before a trial, Marris said. Everything that Read has said “can come back to you in the courtroom. It’s going to be admissible. It’s going to be something that she can be confronted with. It’s going to be something the jury can see.”\n\nEven if a defendant makes statements that seem innocuous at the time, she said, trials are unpredictable and “you can’t entirely predict what’s going to happen and what’s going to come up and what’s ultimately going to be important.”\n\nSo far, prosecutors have used clips to bolster witness testimony and refute some of the defense’s arguments. On Tuesday, Kerry Roberts, who was in the car with Read when they found O’Keefe’s body, testified that Read pointed out to her that morning, part of her taillight was broken.\n\nThe defense suggested in its opening statement that evidence would show the lead investigator at the time, Michael Proctor, tampered with the vehicle and deposited pieces of the taillight in the front yard.\n\nBrennan played a clip of an interview Read did with journalist Gretchen Voss in June 2023 that appeared to back up what Roberts said and cast doubt on the defense’s tampering claim.\n\nAnother danger, defense attorneys say, is that the public statements can create inconsistencies. Defendants, like Read, make a series of official statements when the incident first happened to the police, to witnesses, to family members, for example. Prosecutors can use subsequent public comments to argue to the jury that the defendant’s narrative has changed over time.\n\n“It can paint the defendant as somebody who’s fabricating a story for their own self-interest. It can paint them as a liar,” Marris said.\n\nIn the case of Read, prosecutors played a clip from the ID documentary series where Read said after O’Keefe’s death, “His mother leans over the kitchen island and says to me, ‘I think it looks like he got hit by a car.’” However, Peggy O’Keefe, who testified this week, told jurors she was never in the kitchen with Read that day.\n\nThese challenges have also come up for other high-profile defendants. Bankman-Fried, who was convicted of fraud and conspiracy charges related to the collapse of his cryptocurrency exchange, FTX, issued several public apologies and comments to the press before he was indicted. His statements came shortly after he resigned as CEO and dozens of affiliated companies filed for bankruptcy.\n\n“What SBF is doing is a form of litigation suicide,” Howard Fischer, a former Securities and Exchange Commission lawyer said at the time. “Everything he says that turns out to be contradicted by admissible evidence will be taken as evidence of deceit … I don’t know if this is a sign of unrepentant arrogance, youthful overconfidence, or simply sheer stupidity.”\n\nWhether or not to advise their clients to take the stand is a difficult decision for defense attorneys, Marris said. Public statements make this even more complicated. If a defendant takes the stand, those statements can fuel a harsh cross-examination, she said. If they don’t, prosecutors could still use them to paint a picture of the defendant to the jury, without their direct testimony.\n\nDurst — who did testify — was arrested in 2015 and convicted in 2021 for the killing of Susan Berman in part because of comments he made in a documentary about the case. Several clips from “The Jinx: The Life and Deaths of Robert Durst” were played for the jury during the trial, including one where Durst is heard saying, “Killed them all, of course,” in what was widely interpreted by viewers as a confession.\n\nHowever, transcripts of the audio recording in court revealed that the quotes were spliced and edited to be in a different order and context, The New York Times has reported. Durst has said he was “high on meth” during the taping of the documentary.\n\nPublic statements from a defendant “is a defense attorney’s nightmare,” Marris said, because of the issue of attorney-client privilege. If defendants make comments in public in the presence of their lawyers about details of the litigation, or disclose what she talked about with her lawyers, it could waive that privilege, she said.\n\nIn the documentary about the Read case, she is seen discussing the case with her legal team. Marris said this is “one of the most dangerous lines to walk because the reason that privilege exists is so that a defendant can be completely open and honest with their attorney.”\n\nProsecutors argued that Read waived some attorney-client privileges in her public comments and asked for text communications on certain issues to be turned over. The judge ultimately ruled in Read’s favor, but Marris said, “it was a close one.”\n\n“If you’re in a situation where privilege seems to be waived by the court and you end up turning over communications between attorney and client, it can completely change the game of the case because it is like insight into the legal strategy and into the problems and pressure points of the case that the prosecution would never otherwise have,” she said.\n\nCNN’s Jean Casarez contributed reporting.', 'Extrajudicial statements in the courtroom', 'Published 6:00 AM EDT, Sun April 27, 2025', 'prosecutors-are-already-bringing-karen-reads-interviews-to-the-jury-it-has-hurt-defendants-before-1745804464'),

He pulled the covers over his face as heavy footsteps passed outside his bedroom door. The glowing Batman clock on his wall said it was 3:17 a.m.\n\nThe 11-year-old boy held his breath, a flurry of questions racing through his mind: What was going on? Who was lurking outside his door? What had caused the commotion?\n\nThe footsteps briefly paused in the hallway — as if to check whether he was awake — then faded into the night.\n\nYoung Collier came downstairs the next morning looking for his mother. It was the last day of 1989 — New Year’s Eve — and his father sat on the living room couch in their home in Mansfield, Ohio. He calmly told his son that his mother had left them and gone on a vacation.\n\nSensing Collier’s distrust, his father told him, “I never laid a finger on mommy.” He threatened to punish him if he called the police and reported that she’d disappeared, Landry later said.\n\nThe boy felt something was off. His mother wouldn’t just leave him — especially not during the holiday season, he said. And so began a tragedy that captivated north-central Ohio and soon unearthed one dark secret after another.\n\nDetermined to uncover the truth, Collier called a friend of his mother’s — a woman she’d urged him to contact in an emergency. The call prompted a police investigation, with Collier as a key witness. Without his father’s knowledge he provided crucial details to the lead detective, marking a turning point in the case.\n\nThree weeks after she vanished, police exhumed Noreen Boyle’s body from the basement of a home 175 miles away in Erie, Pennsylvania. She was wrapped in a green tarp and her head was covered with a white plastic bag, which a coroner testified had been used to suffocate her.\n\nFive months later John Francis Boyle Jr. was found guilty of aggravated murder and sentenced to 20 years to life in prison.\n\nAfter more than three decades, the case is back in the spotlight with the release of a new podcast, “Finding Mom’s Killer,” which chronicles how the preteen boy teamed up with Mansfield police detective Dave Messmore to uncover the devastating truth about his mother’s disappearance. Collier Landry told CNN that after years of silence he now regularly talks to his father, who is incarcerated at the Marion Correctional Institute in Ohio.\n\nBoyle is now 81, and his third parole hearing is approaching in August. His son is struggling with a new whirlwind of emotions at the possibility of his dad’s release from prison.\n\n“I don’t feel vengeful toward my father … but it doesn’t mean that we can skip down the yellow brick road holding hands and being like, you know, everything’s great,” said Landry, who dropped the Boyle name after his father’s conviction.\n\nLandry is 47 now — about the same age as his father when he killed his mother.\n\n“I wonder, am I like him? Am I capable of this?” he said. “What separates my life with this person’s life? Why am I the one who will not carry on this legacy of violence?”\n\nTo an outsider, the Boyles’ family life in the 1980s might have appeared idyllic.\n\nJohn Boyle was an osteopathic doctor who ran a family practice in Mansfield. His photogenic family looked like they’d stepped from the pages of a magazine. The couple had also adopted a younger child, Elizabeth, from China and lived in a modest home with their wire fox terrier, Gowdy.\n\nLandry recalled some of his favorite moments during family road trips. His father played classical music in their car, and Landry would sit in the backseat, waving a straw and pretending to be the conductor.\n\nHe loved accompanying his father on his house calls — some doctors still made those back then — in the city of 50,000 people about 75 miles southwest of Cleveland.\n\nDuring those visits, his father appeared especially interested in a younger woman he described as one of his patients, Landry said. He witnessed his father and the woman taking walks, holding hands and stealing kisses.\n\nLandry became more suspicious when he noticed the woman was wearing his mom’s diamond ring. It had two tiny bars to glide the diamonds back-and-forth, a distinctive design that made it easily noticeable, he said.\n\nHe told his mom about the other woman, which led to arguments between his parents, he said. His mother filed for divorce. She began to feel unsafe and gave him the names and numbers of her friends, he said.\n\n“She said, ‘Collier, if your father happens to say that I might have left, call all my friends and have them contact the police and have them investigate how I disappeared,’” Landry testified in court.\n\nThe boy hid the paper with the phone numbers inside a stuffed Garfield cat on his bedroom dresser — not knowing that he’d need it only weeks later.\n\nLess than two months after the couple filed for divorce, Noreen Boyle disappeared.\n\nSuspicious, Collier called her friends soon after, and they notified the police. Messmore, the Mansfield Police detective, showed up at the Boyles’ doorstep.\n\nMessmore, who’s now retired, told CNN that it was unusual for police to rely on the word of an 11-year-old. But Collier — with his neatly coiffed brown hair, pressed slacks, polo shirt and penny loafers — seemed to the detective like a miniature adult who made it clear in no uncertain terms that something had happened to his mother.\n\n“He was … adamant that there was something really wrong,” Messmore said. “He was close with his mother, and she took him everywhere.”\n\nAs Messmore looked deeper into Collier’s concerns, he discovered the couple was in the middle of a bitter divorce and fighting over alimony, child support, joint credit card debts and other financial issues, he said.\n\nMessmore visited the boy at his elementary school. With permission from the principal, they would meet in an empty classroom and talk.\n\nAbout two weeks after Noreen Boyle’s disappearance, Collier found photos in the console of his father’s truck that changed the course of the investigation.\n\nThey showed his father hugging the younger woman next to a fireplace inside a house the boy had never seen before. The woman appeared pregnant. Collier shared the information with Messmore, who discovered that Boyle planned to shutter his Ohio practice for a lucrative job at a company in Erie.\n\nMessmore also learned that Boyle and the woman had bought the house in Erie together, and she had signed the real estate paperwork as his wife.\n\nA search of the Mansfield home had not yielded any clues, so investigators got a warrant for the Erie home, Messmore said.\n\nAuthorities spotted a green carpet in one section of the home’s unfinished basement and ripped it out to reveal a fresh patch of concrete in the shape of a gravesite. They cracked it open and found her body.\n\nProsecutors learned Boyle had rented a jackhammer two days before his wife disappeared and cited it as evidence of premeditation.\n\n“It wasn’t something where he just lost his temper. It was something he planned for a period of time,” Messmore said.\n\nBoyle was indicted and went on trial in June 1990.\n\nCollier, who was the prosecution’s star witness, described the sounds he heard that night. He also shared how his father’s demeanor changed after his mother disappeared. The morning she went missing, he took both children to McDonald’s for pancakes.\n\n“He was acting like daddy dearest and daddy perfect and so nice and stuff like that,” he testified, according to a court transcript.\n\nA jury found Boyle guilty. In statements to the jury, the prosecution used chilling words to describe the doctor: “Healer by day, killer by night.”\n\nWithin months, Collier lost everything: his parents, his sister, his home, his dog. He went from a little boy whose parents doted on him to being the child of both a murderer and a victim.\n\nHe lived in foster homes — Messmore’s family briefly took him in — before he was adopted by a Mansfield couple whose child attended the same private school. His adopted sister went to a different home and like him, changed her last name. Landry has not seen her since, he said.\n\nStill haunted by his mother’s death, Collier Landry reached out to his father in prison not long after he was found guilty. In one of his initial letters in March 1991, he got straight to the point.\n\n“Dad, just to get things off my chest, why did you kill my mom? I know you think you didn’t do it, but if you didn’t, why are you in prison?” he wrote. “Don’t get my reasoning wrong. I do love you. Even though you have hurt me … you are my father. And I owe you a great debt.”\n\nHis father was appealing his conviction and responded with letters calling Landry a liar and urging him to recant his testimony. After he refused, his father sent him an eight-page letter in November 1992 suggesting he was delusional, Landry said.\n\n“I will not subscribe to your petulant attitude. I will not feel sorry for poor Collier,” he wrote. “Your day is coming when all will be displayed in court. The difference will be that I will not remain silent this time. You have released me from any compulsion to protect you.”\n\nLandry cut off communication with his father and built a new life with his adopted family. He majored in vocal performance at Ohio University before dropping out of school to move to Los Angeles, where he works as a freelance filmmaker and podcaster. Today he lives in Santa Monica, California, with his chihuahua, Marisol.\n\n“I got out of Mansfield as fast as I could,” he said. “People always recognized me, stared and whispered. No one knew my story in LA, and I was in a place where I could do something to honor my mother as a filmmaker.”\n\nLandry said he has struggled with his identity as the child of both a murderer and a murder victim. As part of his healing journey, he said, he took part in a 2017 documentary, “Murder in Mansfield” and hosts a podcast, “The Collier Landry Show,” which dissects his mother’s killing and sheds light on the complexities of human violence.\n\nSome people have accused him of exploiting the tragedy for financial gain, which Landry denies.\n\n“Profiteering is a stretch. But I would say the misery is mostly mine, so I’m entitled to use it to raise awareness,” said Landry, who added he’s sharing his story to encourage others going through similar family violence.\n\n“I have lived every step of my life to not be defined by this or to not let myself succumb to this,” he said. “I want to lead by example … you can go through unspeakable traumatic situations and come out on the other side OK. It’s possible.”\n\nAfter not talking to his father for nearly a decade, Landry reconnected with him earlier this year while making the podcast, “Finding Mom’s Killer.” The two now talk frequently by phone but have not met in person since Landry last visited his father in prison in 2015.\n\nTheir most recent conversations included a mix of topics: his father’s beloved Philadelphia Eagles and their Super Bowl run; his plans if he’s granted parole; Landry explaining how text messages work.\n\nLandry said he still wonders what drove his dad to kill his mother just as his career as a doctor was taking off.\n\n“You had everything — a family, a thriving business. You f***ed everything up … Why? For what?” he said. “You caused so much reciprocal damage to so many people. Not just me. Not just my mother, not just him — there were so many ancillary characters, so much collateral damage from his violence.”\n\nFor years, Boyle denied killing his wife.\n\nDuring the trial in June 1990, he denied responsibility for her death and said he didn’t know how her body got in the basement of the home in Erie, Messmore said.\n\nHe stuck to that story for decades until he appeared on “Finding Mom’s Killer.” In the podcast, he confessed to killing his wife and offered his version of how it happened, but said it was an accident.\n\n“Noreen’s death will always remain a tragedy forever into eternity and I’m the one responsible for that — accidental or otherwise,” Boyle said on the podcast.\n\nHe said she fatally hit her head on a stool during an explosive argument and that he covered her head with the plastic bag out of guilt. He loaded her body in his car that night and drove it to his new home in Erie the next day.\n\n“I dragged it over and put it in the hole … thinking it’s going to disappear on its own,” Boyle said in the podcast. “Thinking if I covered it up, it would never be discovered. And I would never have to see it again or think about it.”\n\nBut Messmore said he doesn’t buy Boyle’s story. As a doctor he should have treated his wife’ injuries, but he wanted to get rid of her and start a new life with his pregnant girlfriend, Messmore said.\n\n“I’d like to see him stay in prison for the rest of his life,” he said about his upcoming parole hearing. “He’s got no business being out here.”\n\nNo attorney is listed for Boyle’s upcoming parole hearing. He declined to comment when CNN reached out to him through his son.\n\nLandry also believes his mother’s death wasn’t an accident.\n\nBut his feelings about his father’s potential release are more complicated. He wonders how an elderly convicted murderer would re-enter a world that’s nothing like the one he left behind.\n\nWhere would his father live? How can he readjust to a society that’s mostly digital? Would he be able to work and support himself?\n\n“It’s hard enough for anybody to get a job these days, let alone a convicted felon who’s going to be 82 years old,” he said.\n\nOn a recent phone call, his dad joked about moving into his son’s garage. Landry quickly shut that idea down.\n\nLandry said he hasn’t listened to the new podcast because it’s overwhelming for him to revisit the grim details about his mother’s murder. He took a deep breath before clarifying that he has no hate for his father and is not against his parole.\n\n“It’s a lot for me to think about. I’m still trying to keep my own head above water. I’m still dealing with the lingering effects of this trauma and what I’ve been through,” he said.\n\nHis dad’s potential prison release adds another layer of complexity, he said. “What makes sense? What doesn’t? What’s fair? There are so many different nuances with all of this.”\n\nLandry said he wonders what his life would have been like if his mom wasn’t killed. He wonders what it’s like to grow up in a family with “normal” parents.\n\n“My favorite quality about myself is I’m a genuinely nice and kind person,” he said. “I’m just grateful that this tragedy didn’t rob me of these things.”\n\nHe relishes his life in Southern California, where he can go to the beach, play pickleball with friends and pursue his photography and filmmaking passions without the burden of his father’s shadow. There, he said, he can share his story on his own terms.\n\nThe little boy who sent his father to prison is gone.

During the routine security screening required for base access, the woman’s name was flagged as a problem.\n\nBase personnel contacted the Naval Criminal Investigative Service, which looked into the matter, said the official.

The Trump administration says her mother asked officials to take her with her, documents show.\n\nUS District Judge Terry Doughty said the child, identified in the court documents as V.M.L., was released in Honduras Friday afternoon alongside her mother, who the judge said is an undocumented immigrant.\n\nLawyers for the family filed an emergency petition Thursday, asking the court to order the child’s “immediate release” by the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement, saying they “lack any statutory or constitutional authority” to detain her as a US citizen, according to the petition.\n\nThe child was born in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, on January 4, 2023, the petition says. The child was taken into custody by ICE Tuesday morning with her mother and her 11-year-old sister, while the mother was “attending a routine check-in” with the federal agency, according to the petition.\n\n“In the interest of dispelling our strong suspicion that the government just deported a US citizen with no meaningful process,” Judge Doughty said in the order, a hearing is scheduled on May 16 in Monroe, Louisiana.\n\nThe judge added, “It is illegal and unconstitutional to deport, detain for deportation, or recommend deportation of a U.S. citizen,” citing a 2012 deportation case.\n\nThe federal government, Doughty said, “contends this is all okay because the mother wishes that the child be deported with her … But the court doesn’t know that.”\n\nThe court documents filed by the government opposing the petition argued that the child’s mother, “made known to ICE officials she wanted to retain custody of V.M.L.” in a handwritten note and requested for the child to go with her to Honduras.\n\nAuthorities in Honduras, US Immigration and Customs Enforcement, lawyers for the family and the US Justice Department did not immediately return requests for comment.\n\nIn a statement to CNN, a senior Department of Homeland Security official said the mother “made the decision to take the child with them to Honduras. It is common that parents want to be removed with their children.”\n\n“Parents are asked if they want to be removed with their children or ICE will place the children with someone the parent designates. In this case, the parent stated they wanted to be removed with the children,” the official said.\n\nThe DHS, the official said, takes its “responsibility to protect children seriously and will continue to work with federal law enforcement to ensure that children are safe and protected.”\n\nRoughly an hour after the mother and her two daughters went into the agency’s office in New Orleans, the father received a call from the agency saying, “the family had all been taken to the immigration office and gave him an address,” the petition says.\n\nWhen the father arrived at the address, which led him to the ICE field office in New Orleans, officers gave him a paper saying the mother was “under their custody” and said they could not give him any more information but V.M.L’.s mother “would call him soon,” the petition said.\n\nAn ICE officer was then in contact with the father’s attorney, informing him the mother’s deportation “was certain and he believed they were all in a hotel” but would not disclose the location, according to the petition, nor could he facilitate a legal call between the attorney and the child’s mother.\n\nThe same day, the father was again contacted by an ICE officer who said the mother was in their custody and informed the father that the mother and daughters were going to be deported, court documents showed. “He heard his daughters crying and his partner crying. He reminded V.M.L.’s mother that their daughter was a US citizen and could not be deported,” the documents say.\n\nBefore the father could finish providing the mother with contact information for their attorneys, he heard the ICE officer “take the phone from her and hang up the call,” according to the petition.\n\nThe father then moved to give provisional custody of his two daughters to his sister-in-law, a US citizen who lives in Baton Rouge, and the mandate was notarized in Louisiana, the documents say.\n\nThe petition alleges ICE refused to honor the father’s request to release V.M.L. to the sister-in-law, stating “it was not needed” because the child was already with her mother, and informed the father he would be taken into custody if he tried to pick her up.\n\nThe federal government said in court documents the mother wrote in a letter she “will bring my daughter … with me to Honduras.”\n\nThe government said the “man claiming to be V.M.L.’s father” has not presented or identified himself to ICE despite requests to do so, the court documents say.\n\n“V.M.L. is not at substantial risk of irreparable harm if kept with her lawful custodian mother,” the government said.', '', 'Updated 4:35 PM EDT, Sat April 26, 2025', 'federal-judge-says-2yearold-us-citizen-was-deported-with-mother-to-honduras-1745804464'),

Petrova told the AP she didn’t realize the items needed to be declared and was not trying to sneak in anything. After an interrogation, Petrova was told her visa was being cancelled.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security said in a statement on X that Petrova was detained after “lying to federal officers about carrying substances into the country.” They allege messages on her phone “revealed she planned to smuggle the materials through customs without declaring them.”\n\nPetrova’s boss and mentor, Leon Peshkin, said the samples were not in any way dangerous or biohazardous.\n\n“I don’t think she did anything wrong,” Peshkin told the AP. “But even if she did, at most she should have gotten a warning or maybe a fine of up to $500.”\n\nHarvard said in a statement that the university “continues to monitor the situation.”\n\nPetrova has a very special scientific skill set required by the work, said Peshkin, a principal research scientist at Harvard’s Department of Systems Biology who explained Petrova is assisting an investigation into the earliest stages of cell division using frog embryos.\n\n“She has made herself crucial to pretty much every project that’s going on in the lab. I don’t know how we’re gonna continue without her,” Peshkin said.\n\nWill Trim, a postdoctoral fellow and Petrova’s roommate, backed the description of her scientific value. He has worked with her as she writes computer scripts to read images from a unique microscope that Trim believes has the potential to make breakthroughs in cancer detection.\n\n“Some very important research will end if she’s gone,” Trim said.\n\nTrim boarded a flight to Louisiana on Friday to visit Petrova, who is allotted one visitor a week.\n\nThe facility is one of nine immigration detention centers in the state, all located in the rural north or western parts of the state. Many detainees have complained of isolation as they are held long distances from their families and attorneys.\n\nLouisiana has been at the center of other high-profile immigration cases, including the detention of Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University activist.\n\nLike many others in detention, Petrova left her country to avoid conflict or possible political repression. She fled after Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, marking the start of a bloody three-year war.\n\n“If I go back, I am afraid I will be imprisoned because of my political position and my position against war,” Petrova said.\n\nA Louisiana immigration judge earlier this week found the federal government’s case to be legally insufficient and gave ICE a week to submit stronger evidence.\n\nPetrova’s case is being closely watched by the scientific community, with some fearing it could impact recruiting and retaining foreign scientists at US universities.\n\n“I think that there is a wrong perception that foreign scientists are somehow privileged to be in the United States.

Supporters at the protest Friday and a similar protest in February carried “Free Luigi” signs or wore green in a reference to Nintendo’s “Luigi” character. In his time behind bars, Mangione has received hundreds of letters from across the US as well as from Brazil, Japan and Australia. Two heart-shaped notes were even smuggled into a pair of his argyle socks prior to a recent court hearing.\n\nHis legal defense fund has raised over $950,000 from about 27,000 people as of April 25. A website set up by his legal defense lists 13 “Frequently Asked Questions,” and 10 of them relate to sending him letters or contributing to his fund.\n\nMangione himself has taken notice.\n\n“I am overwhelmed by – and grateful for – everyone who has written me to share their stories and express their support,” Mangione said in a note to supporters posted on the defense website. “Powerfully, this support has transcended political, racial, and even class divisions, as mail has flooded MDC from across the country, and around the globe.”\n\nCNN spoke with a number of Mangione’s supporters to better understand their position on the man and on America’s health care system at large.\n\nThe crux of their support is based on a deep resentment and anger at the American health care system and insurance companies, but it goes well beyond that frustration. Others offered support in a show of opposition to the government’s aggressive charging decisions and the potential death penalty. Looming over it all is a belief that The Elites are cracking down on The People to uphold The System.\n\n“They’re putting all of this effort and the death penalty behind one person who allegedly killed one CEO who is responsible and profiting off of the death of thousands upon thousands of sick people and bringing people into financial ruin as well as death,” said Tilly, a Mangione supporter wearing a lime green jacket and light green sunglasses. “They do not put this same effort behind, say, school shooters or people who shoot up concerts.”\n\n“It shows that the state has more care for the uber-wealthy and the CEOs that are profiting off of people’s death and pain than they do for the people.”\n\nThe core reason for Mangione’s support is a deep dislike of American health care insurance companies, and this has curdled into disdain and resentment for the executives in charge.\n\n“Sometimes, drug dealers get shot,” comedian Chris Rock succinctly put it when discussing the incident in his “Saturday Night Live” monologue last December.\n\nIco Ahyicodae, the project coordinator with the group People Over Profit NYC, attended Friday’s protest and said the shooting brought mass attention to the problems with the health care system.\n\n“This is less about Luigi than it is about Brian Thompson,” Ahyicodae said. “Before Luigi was even a person of interest in the case, people exploded with health care stories.”\n\nThompson, a 50-year-old husband and father of two, was appointed CEO of UnitedHealthcare in 2021 and had worked at the company since 2004. UnitedHealthcare, part of UnitedHealth Group, is the largest health care organization in the US and was holding an investors’ conference in New York around the time he was killed.\n\nMangione was not insured by UnitedHealthcare, but he allegedly had a notebook that expressed “hostility toward the health insurance industry and wealthy executives in particular,” according to a federal complaint.\n\nNotably, three 9 mm shell casings from the crime scene had the words “delay,” “deny” and “depose” written on them, the NYPD has said, an apparent reference to a 2010 book critiquing insurance industry tactics to avoid paying for care.\n\nUnitedHealthcare has defended the company and Thompson. In a December statement, UnitedHealthcare said “highly inaccurate and grossly misleading information has been circulated about our company’s treatment of insurance claims” and that it “approves and pays about 90% of medical claims upon submission.”\n\nStill, even UnitedHealth Group CEO Andrew Witty acknowledged the health care system’s flaws.\n\n“We know the health system does not work as well as it should, and we understand people’s frustrations with it,” Witty wrote in a guest essay in the New York Times. “No one would design a system like the one we have. And no one did. It’s a patchwork built over decades.”\n\nAt the protest Friday, Elena held a sign saying, “No more death by deductible$” and criticized the health care system’s “complete and utter failings.”\n\n“I’m pointing to the high deductibles that everyday Americans have to face in order to get basic health care. Just going to the doctor for really simple procedures can end up being thousands of dollars’ worth of bills. None of it is very predictable, the system is obscured, and it’s intentional,” she said.\n\nShe said she goes “back and forth” on whether Mangione should really be set free.\n\n“There’s a lot of sympathy for Luigi,” she said, noting his online posts about a back injury and surgery. “Seems to be like he was mad at the health care system, like we all are. I obviously don’t think anyone should be murdered, and I don’t think that’s a way to solve the problem, but I sympathize with the idea that we can actually make that happen and just to use this moment to make that happen.”\n\nDr. Shane Solger, an emergency and internal medicine doctor, came to the protest wearing blue scrubs on behalf of the Physicians for a National Health Program, a group supporting universal, single-payer health care. He said he did not support Mangione – but he understood why Mangione allegedly did what he did.\n\n“We are certainly not pro-murder, but we do recognize that Luigi is standing as a surrogate for rebellion against the current health care system as it exists right now,” he said. He criticized the “for-profit health care system that isn’t taking care of people, that is doing what they can to try to siphon off as much money as they can, and we’re seeing people get hurt, with Luigi being a manifestation of that hurt.”\n\nA second element of Mangione’s support stems from the aggressive legal prosecution and political posturing in his case.\n\nAfter his arrest at an Altoona McDonald’s, Mangione was whisked from Pennsylvania to downtown New York on a jet and a helicopter in a remarkable spectacle in front of media cameras. Once in New York, a handcuffed Mangione was led on a lengthy “perp walk” by a swarm of heavily armed NYPD officers, with New York Mayor Eric Adams and NYPD commissioner Jessica Tisch right behind them.\n\nMangione faces charges in three different venues – Pennsylvania, New York and in federal court – and each count is more serious than the last. In New York, he pleaded not guilty to a charge of first-degree murder to further “an act of terrorism.”\n\nFederally, Mangione was indicted on charges of murder, stalking and a firearms offense. Even before his indictment, though, Attorney General Pam Bondi said the Justice Department would seek the death penalty against him.\n\nMangione’s attorney Karen Friedman Agnifilo sharply criticized this decision in a statement earlier this month.\n\n“By seeking to murder Luigi Mangione, the Justice Department has moved from the dysfunctional to the barbaric,” she wrote. “Their decision to execute Luigi is political and goes against the recommendation of the local federal prosecutors, the law, and historical precedent. While claiming to protect against murder, the federal government moves to commit the pre-meditated, state-sponsored murder of Luigi.”\n\nLindsy Floyd, a 40-year-old living in Connecticut, told CNN she made arrangements for her two children and drove to New York to be present for Mangione’s hearing Friday.\n\nShe criticized the health care industry and noted Thompson’s role in a company that she claims is responsible for countless deaths. Putting a twist on an old saying, she said Mangione was the proverbial “canary” sounding the alarm about the “coal mine” that is the for-profit health care industry.\n\n“Do we just punish the canary in the coal mine, or do we look at whether or not a coal mine is a good idea in the first place?” she asked.\n\nBill Dobbs held a sign saying, “No Death for Luigi Mangione” and said he was there with the group Death Penalty Action to oppose capital punishment. A lawyer, Dobbs said he opposes the death penalty in all cases, saying it throws the whole justice system “out of whack.”\n\n“Executions and the availability of them make things like life in prison without parole seem reasonable,” he said. “We’re crazy for punishment, and we’re also crazy for rich people.”\n\nChelsea Manning, the former US Army soldier and whistleblower convicted of violating the Espionage Act after leaking documents to WikiLeaks, attended Mangione’s court hearing and afterwards criticized the legal case against him.\n\n“This case is being speed run in an unprecedented manner,” Manning said. “We don’t speed run justice.”\n\nAsked if she is a Mangione supporter, she said, “I’m a supporter of the justice system being done in a fair manner. I feel it’s important for me to witness that and observe that, and now I understand why.”\n\nFinally, some supporters have positioned Mangione as a folk hero of sorts in the vein of Robin Hood or bank robber Jesse James standing up against the elites.\n\nIn an essay in The New Yorker, Jessica Winter placed Mangione in the context of the folk hero outlaw.\n\n“Mangione allegedly took a human life, which is despicable,” she wrote. “This act did not justify itself. But this act also gave people permission to go far enough – to acknowledge their righteous hatred of our depraved health-care system, and even to conjure something funny or silly or joyous out of that hate.”\n\nSeveral of the largest donations to Mangione’s legal defense relate to this broader point saying his shooting was a way of standing up to the elites.\n\n“I am disturbed by what the government is doing to you,” said one anonymous donor who gave $5,000 to Mangione’s defense fund. “They are clearly making an example of you. For them, it was and always will be about protecting the 1%. I’m disgusted at this gross miscarriage of justice, so here I am again. This is not only your fight but ours as well. Head up, Luigi. We are right here with you.”\n\n“Such ridiculous gov overcharging & overreach; the 1% lobbied for Luigi’s harshest charges,” wrote an anonymous donor who gave about $5,700 to his fund. “Social media companies censor sympathetic content, & the press vilifies him. Luigi’s (treatment) has been an affront to justice! He deserves a fair trial-not political persecution.”\n\nFriedman Agnifilo, Mangione’s attorney, connected the decision to seek the death penalty to broader systemic failures in a recent statement.\n\n“By doing this, they are defending the broken, immoral, and murderous healthcare industry that continues to terrorize the American people,” she wrote.\n\nKatie, the protester wearing the “But Daddy I Love Him” shirt, said she believed her position was bipartisan.\n\n“This is just about humans. I think that’s why they’re so scared is because he’s getting so much support and it is uniting the right and left,” she said. “This is the one issue I find that everyone is like, ‘Yeah.’”', 'Frustration with health care', 'Published 7:00 AM EDT, Sat April 26, 2025', 'what-luigi-mangione-supporters-want-you-to-know-1745804464'),

Most school districts – at risk of losing state funding – have since complied with the order, with the Massapequa Union Free School District in particular standing out in defiance of it and taking the matter to court.\n\nThe district’s stance is a source of frustration for one resident, who played hockey for the Massapequa High Chiefs and later in life learned he was of Native American descent.\n\n“I understand the attachment to the mascot,” Adam Drexler, 60, told CNN, saying his issue is not so much the ban but with how people are discussing it in his community.\n\n“They talk about respecting and honoring Native Americans that were here first but they’re not,” Drexler said. “If they were, they would revisit the image.”\n\nThe school district sued the state in federal court in September 2023 in an attempt to keep the chief as its mascot, embarking on a subsequent legal battle that came to a head last month, with a judge dismissing the case.\n\nIn her March 27 ruling, the judge stated the plaintiff failed to support its claim. US District Court Chief Judge Margo K. Brodie gave Massapequa schools 30 days to modify its claim or face permanent closure of the case. On Friday, the judge granted the plaintiff’s request for an extension, setting May 12 as the deadline to file an amended claim.\n\nTrump weighed in on the matter on social media this week, voicing support for the school system in a region he comfortably won in 2024. He called the name change “ridiculous” and noted the NFL’s Kansas City Chiefs aren’t changing its name anytime soon.\n\nThe president’s support for the district is consistent with his stance against diversity, equity and inclusion programs, which has recently played out in his administration’s crackdown on higher education institutions.\n\n“I agree with the people in Massapequa, Long Island, who are fighting furiously to keep the Massapequa Chiefs logo on their Teams and School,” Trump said in a Truth Social post. “I am asking my highly capable Secretary of Education, Linda McMahon, to fight for the people of Massapequa on this very important issue.”\n\nCNN has reached out to the US Department of Education for more on possible actions it may take.\n\nTrump addressed the issue again on Wednesday when asked about the NFL’s Washington Commanders changing its name from the Washington Redskins, telling reporters it’s “demeaning” and “degrading to the Indian populations” to “erase” a Native American name from sports teams and logos.\n\nIn a joint statement, the Massapequa Board of Education referred to Trump’s stance as “affirmation” of what the district was fighting for.\n\n“The Massapequa community has been working hard to preserve our identity and protect local decision-making. We are honored that President Trump has recognized our efforts and brought national attention to our cause,” read the statement. CNN has inquired if officials in Massapequa reached out to the president for assistance after the legal setback.\n\nThe state education department has remained steadfast in its position insisting the 2023 regulation was adopted to prevent “demeaning Indigenous names and mascots in New York’s public schools.”\n\n“It is ironic that the federal government now seeks to intervene on an issue that is squarely reserved to the States,” state education department spokesperson JP O’Hare said in a statement to CNN.\n\nThe Massapequa school district, which serves around 6,500 students, led three other Long Island public school systems into civil court seeking to overturn the ban, arguing it constituted government overreach and violated the First Amendment.\n\n“The ‘Chiefs’ mascot is not just a school sports mascot, it is a mindset that unifies the Massapequa community and encourages them to strive for excellence,” the lawsuit says.\n\nThe suit referenced an April 18, 2023, letter to the Massapequa community stating the mascot “honors Chief (Sachem) Tackapausha, who, according to local history sources, sold the area now known as Massapequa Park to a group of settlers in 1658.”\n\nThe letter also stated, “from our very name of Massapequa to the many historical plaques located throughout town, we pay our respects to 365 years of history.”\n\nThe lawsuit notes that the name Massapequa itself “is derived from the Native American term “Marspeag” or “Mashpeag,” which translates to “great waterland.”\n\nO’Hare said Massapequa school officials “stayed silent during the regulatory process,” adding they did not reach out to Indigenous leaders or engage the department’s Mascot Advisory Committee to determine whether its Native American team name and mascot would be permissible – which requires the approval of “local tribal leaders.”\n\n“Instead, Massapequa decided to pursue litigation challenging the State’s regulations. Unsurprisingly, these cases have been dismissed,” O’Hare said in his statement to CNN.\n\nIn their complaint, attorneys for the school district said, “Native American tribes and individuals cannot be the sole decision-makers on whether a school district’s use of an Indigenous name, logo or mascot is legal or not.”\n\nLong Island is home to two recognized Indian tribes, the Shinnecock Nation and the Unkechaug Nation, which are based on two separate reservations east of Massapequa. CNN has reached out to representatives of both Nations for comment.\n\nIn his statement, O’Hare quoted Germain Smith, former general council secretary of the Shinnecock Nation, as supporting the education department’s position: “Speaking for myself as a tribal leader and as an Indigenous person, the message that is being sent by [the state regulations] is that we’re not a symbol, we’re not a mascot, we’re not history. We’re real people that are still here and still exist.”\n\nDrexler, the former Chiefs hockey player, was reluctant to get into the politics of it all. He focused on the appropriateness of the image, in particular the headdress, which he called, “the Hollywood romanticized image of the Native American.”\n\nDrexler said in 2000 he re-connected with his biological mother who informed him of his heritage. He is a member of the Chickasaw Nation.\n\n“I was adopted into White Jewish family only to find out at 35 that I was Native American…. I can’t claim what it feels like to be Native American. I look like a typical White boy,” said Drexler, who works in commercial sales but spends time researching Indigenous history since his “life-changing moment.”\n\nWhile walking near the chief mural on Tuesday, Donna Schneider, said she agreed with fellow residents that the Chief logo should not be switched but she wished the White House would stay out of it. Schneider said she works with the Massapequa school district’s administration department.\n\n“Don’t get me started. He’s got bigger fish to fry,” said Schneider, referring to the president. “I don’t think this should be on his platform at all. I just don’t think it’s a Trump issue or presidential issue.”\n\nBack inside the barber shop, the president’s attempt to intervene in the bitter battle between the district and the state was well-received.\n\n“I think it affects everybody. He represents us….I’m glad he’s standing up for this,” Grimaldi said as he got his haircut.\n\nWhile the school district may ultimately lose the legal battle over its use of Chiefs, the associated image likely will remain a staple in the community: Tackapausha’s profile adorns the Massapequa Chamber of Commerce welcome sign and is featured on its fire department’s trucks and patches.', 'Legal battle comes to a head', 'Updated 6:11 AM EDT, Sat April 26, 2025', 'a-long-island-communitys-chief-concern-draws-president-trumps-attention-1745804464'),

A timeline of the dispute', 'https://edition.cnn.com/2025/04/26/us/harvard-university-trump-timeline/index.html', 'Andy Rose', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2210118600.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_833,w_1480,c_fill', 'Students walk through Harvard University\'s campus on April 17 in Cambridge, Massachusetts.', 'Since returning to office in January, President Donald Trump has made a major push to put America’s elite universities on notice over political ideology. But the groundwork for the White House’s stronger stance was laid more than a year earlier.\n\nTwo months after Hamas’ October 7, 2023, attack on Israel sparked the Gaza war – and protests over it at US colleges – the then-president of Harvard University was asked in a congressional hearing whether “calling for the genocide of Jews” would violate Harvard’s rules against bullying and harassment.\n\n“It can be, depending on the context,” Claudine Gay said in a response that slackened the jaws of many students and donors and deeply divided the campus and its alumni.\n\nGay later apologized. But the backlash, plus a plagiarism scandal, ultimately led her to resign, with Jewish organizations agreeing the nation’s oldest, wealthiest and most prestigious university wasn’t taking antisemitism seriously enough.\n\nThe reaction also provided a fresh line of criticism for conservative groups and politicians who for decades had complained about liberal teachings at ivory tower institutions.\n\nHarvard soon launched a task force on antisemitism that called for stronger action against “harassment, abuse and intimidation” and more consistent discipline for violators. Since then, the school says it has tightened its ban on encampments and other protests that disrupt student activities, made “doxing” a violation of its anti-harassment and anti-bullying rules and expanded “inclusion and belonging efforts” to include Jewish students.\n\nStill, the Trump administration’s claims of campus antisemitism continue to dog Harvard, with the White House this month making sweeping new policy demands of its leaders while threatening billions of dollars in federal funding. The Anti-Defamation League and Harvard’s Hillel chapter have expressed appreciation for the administration’s focus on antisemitism but also decried funding cuts as overreach with the potential to harm Jewish students.\n\nWhile such pressure has yielded changes at other American universities, Harvard has refused to comply and is now the first institution to sue the Republican administration over it, claiming it violated federal procedures and the First Amendment.\n\nHere’s a timeline of key events in the Harvard dispute:\n\nJanuary 29: Days into his second term, Trump signs an executive order calling for tougher enforcement of government efforts against antisemitism. Since the October 7, 2023, attack, “Jewish students have faced an unrelenting barrage of discrimination; denial of access to campus common areas and facilities, including libraries and classrooms; and intimidation, harassment, and physical threats and assault,” the order says.\n\nNo specific universities are mentioned, but top administration officials are told to recommend how higher education institutions should “monitor for and report activities by alien students and staff” and how the government “if warranted, (take) actions to remove such aliens” under federal legal authority that covers any foreigner who “endorses or espouses terrorist activity.”\n\nThe administration will cite the executive order repeatedly in pressuring Harvard to change its policies and separately will use claims of participation in pro-Palestinian protests or other claims without evidence to move to deport or revoke the visas of foreign scholars.\n\nFebruary 3: The Department of Justice announces the creation of a multiagency Task Force to Combat Anti-Semitism led by Leo Terrell, a lawyer and former talk radio host who, upon his appointment by Trump as an assistant attorney general for civil rights in the Department of Justice, retweeted an X post calling him “HARVARD’S WORST NIGHTMARE.”\n\nFebruary 27: The Department of Justice’s Civil Rights Division sends a letter to Harvard President Alan Garber demanding a meeting within 30 days with “relevant administrators, faculty, staff members, and any on-campus Jewish stakeholder groups” relative to Trump’s executive order on curbing antisemitism.\n\n“(W)e write to notify you that we are aware of allegations that your institution may have failed to protect Jewish students and faculty members from unlawful discrimination, in potential violation of statutes that we enforce,” says the letter signed by Terrell.\n\nFebruary 28: The Task Force to Combat Anti-Semitism announces it will visit 10 university campuses to “meet with university leadership, impacted students and staff, local law enforcement, and community members.” Harvard is among them.\n\nMarch 8: “We’re going to bankrupt these universities. We’re going to take away every single federal dollar,” Terrell tells Fox News regarding institutions he accuses of permitting antisemitism, adding, “If these universities do not play ball, lawyer up, because the federal government is coming after you.”\n\nMarch 10: Harvard is included in a list of 60 schools receiving letters from the Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights, advising them they are under investigation for potential Civil Rights Act violations “relating to antisemitic harassment and discrimination.”\n\n“US colleges and universities benefit from enormous public investments funded by US taxpayers,” Education Secretary Linda McMahon says in a statement. “That support is a privilege, and it is contingent on scrupulous adherence to federal antidiscrimination laws.”\n\nMarch 31: The General Services Administration notifies Harvard it is conducting an official review “of all Federal contracts and grants,” with “greater than $8.7 billion of multi-year grant commitments” to be reviewed, according to a memo and an email from an agency commissioner, Josh Gruenbaum. “The Federal Government reserves the right to terminate for convenience any contracts it has with your institution at any time during the period of performance,” the memo says.\n\nApril 1: Trump speaks favorably of the idea of cutting off all federal funding to Harvard, The New York Times later reported. “Wouldn’t that be cool?” the president says in a private interaction at the White House, according to a person familiar with the conversation.\n\nApril 3: The GSA’s Gruenbaum tells Harvard’s Garber via email, “I am sending you an official notice of pre-conditions your institution must comply with in order to be in good standing and continue to be the recipient of federal taxpayer dollars.”\n\nAttached to the email is a two-page letter also signed by attorneys with the Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Education with “immediate next steps that we regard as necessary for Harvard University’s continued financial relationship with the United States government.”\n\nIn addition to demanding further steps to prevent antisemitism and punish those who discriminate against Jewish people, the letter demands Harvard “cease all preferences based on race, color, or national origin” in admissions and hiring, make efforts to “shutter” DEI programs and improve “viewpoint diversity.”\n\nApril 11: The Trump administration sends a new letter expanding on the April 3 correspondence. In stronger language, the same attorneys write, “Harvard has in recent years failed to live up to both the intellectual and civil rights conditions that justify federal investment.”\n\nThat is followed by a proposed four-page “agreement in principle” of demands. They include Harvard reform its international student program “to prevent admitting students hostile to the American values and institutions inscribed in the US Constitution and Declaration of Independence, including students supportive of terrorism or anti-Semitism,” and report to the federal government any foreign student who commits conduct violations.\n\nThe proposed agreement would also require Harvard to pay for outside review through 2028 of the school’s “viewpoint diversity” and hire a “critical mass of new faculty” if it is not found to be sufficiently diverse. Additionally, the previous email’s requirement of “efforts” to close DEI programs is made mandatory by August.\n\nApril 14: Harvard publicly releases the April 11 letter as well as a response from Garber, who categorically refuses the proposal, saying the government’s demands would violate the First Amendment. “The University will not surrender its independence or relinquish its constitutional rights,” he writes.\n\n“No government – regardless of which party is in power – should dictate what private universities can teach, whom they can admit and hire, and which areas of study and inquiry they can pursue.”\n\nWhile the administration confirms the legitimacy of its April 11 letter, a senior official later told the New York Times it was intended to continue negotiations. “It was malpractice on the side of Harvard’s lawyers not to pick up the phone and call the members of the antisemitism task force who they had been talking to for weeks,” May Mailman, the White House senior policy strategist, said to the Times.\n\nOn the same day, the Task Force to Combat Anti-Semitism announces “a freeze on $2.2 billion in multi-year grants and $60 (million) in multi-year contract value” to Harvard in response to the school’s actions. “Within hours of the Freeze Order, Harvard began receiving stop work orders,” the university says in its lawsuit.\n\nApril 15: Trump says in a Truth Social post: “Perhaps Harvard should lose its Tax Exempt Status and be Taxed as a Political Entity if it keeps pushing political, ideological, and terrorist inspired/supporting ‘Sickness?’”\n\nShortly afterward, the Internal Revenue Service begins making plans to rescind Harvard’s tax-exempt status. The idea “was certainly worth looking into,” McMahon, the education secretary, tells CNN.\n\nApril 16: The Department of Homeland Security threatens to revoke Harvard’s certification to participate in the Student and Exchange Visa Program, jeopardizing the enrollment of thousands of international students. “It is a privilege to have foreign students attend Harvard University, not a guarantee,” reads the letter.\n\nApril 17: The Department of Education sends a records request to Harvard demanding information on all overseas gifts, plus information relating to “expelled foreign students,” effectively reviving a four-year investigation closed at the end of the Biden administration, with Harvard agreeing to update its financial disclosures.\n\n“Critical aspects of Harvard’s recent foreign funding disclosure submissions are a cause for concern with the Department,” the letter says.\n\nApril 21: Harvard sues the Trump administration, calling threats to its federal funding a violation of the First Amendment, as well as “arbitrary and capricious.”\n\n“HHS has not notified Harvard of, or provided any justification for, the imposition of any additional conditions on any specific grants,” the lawsuit says, adding the White House has failed to follow the law on how grants can be canceled.\n\nApril 22: Still, the Trump administration considers itself to be in an ongoing negotiation with Harvard and other universities, and the demands in the letters sent to Harvard are part of the back-and-forth, the education secretary reiterates.\n\n“We had hoped Harvard would come back to the table to discuss these. We would like to have viewpoint diversity,” McMahon tells CNBC’s “Squawk Box.” The April 11 letter, she added, “was intended to have both parties sit down again and continue their negotiations.”\n\nApril 23: Harvard asks a federal judge to fast-track its legal challenge to the funding freeze, arguing it threatens critical research and academic endeavors and “chills Harvard’s exercise of its First Amendment rights,” its filing states.\n\nApril 28: The first court appearance for both sides in Harvard’s lawsuit is set for this date by US Judge Allison Burroughs – a Barack Obama appointee – in a Boston courtroom.

CNN has reached out to their attorney for comment.\n\nThe migrant, Cristhian Ortega-Lopez, is a Venezuelan who was charged earlier this year for unlawful possession of a firearm or ammunition, court documents show.\n\nHomeland Security Investigations launched an investigation into Ortega-Lopez in January after receiving an anonymous tip accusing him of living with other undocumented migrants at a home owned by Nancy and Jose Cano in Las Cruces and carrying firearms, the complaints state.\n\nUS Attorney General Pamela Bondi told Fox News Friday authorities got a tip the migrant had been living with the judge. “This is the last person we want in our country, nor will we ever tolerate a judge or anyone else harboring them,” she said.\n\nOrtega-Lopez had posted photos and videos on Facebook showing him at what appears to be a shooting range in Las Cruces and observed to be holding handguns or assault-style rifles, according to the complaint against him.\n\nInvestigators said they identified tattoos, clothing and hand gestures “commonly associated” with Tren de Aragua in photos and videos posted online by Ortega-Lopez, saying this “provide(s) strong evidence of Cristhian Ortega’s potential connection” to the gang, according to the criminal complaint.\n\nTren de Aragua is a criminal gang that originated in a Venezuelan prison and now operates in the United States. The gang has been linked to human trafficking and other crimes targeting migrants, as well as money laundering, drug smuggling, kidnapping and extortion, according to the US Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control.\n\nThe former judge staunchly denied any wrongdoing and maintained he had no prior knowledge of Ortega-Lopez’s alleged ties to the Tren de Aragua gang, or of the two other men who associated with him, and defended his decision to allow the men to stay on his property, CNN affiliate KOAT reported, citing a 23-page letter previously submitted to the New Mexico Supreme Court.\n\n“Let me be as crystal clear as possible,” Jose Luis Cano wrote, KOAT reported. “The very first time I ever heard that (the men) could possibly have any association with Tren de Aragua was when I was informed of that by (the) agents on the day of the raid.”\n\nTwo search warrants were executed on February 28, with one location being the Canos’ home, and Ortega-Lopez was ultimately arrested and charged, the complaints state. Investigators found three cell phones belonging to Ortega-Lopez at the Canos’ home, while four firearms were found at a separate residence that was also searched, according to the complaints.\n\nA phone call Ortega-Lopez made at the time of his arrest made investigators believe he might have another cell phone, the documents show. On April 22, investigators requested any “recorded jail calls, messages, videos, and deposits pertaining to Ortega.”\n\nThey discovered two video messages between Nancy Cano and Ortega-Lopez, which showed a fourth phone and the two discussing how to potentially delete Ortega-Lopez’s Facebook accounts, the complaint against Nancy Cano states.\n\nThis prompted investigators to execute a warrant at the Cano property Thursday looking for another phone owned by Ortega-Lopez, as well as a phone owned by Nancy Cano, according to the complaint.\n\nDuring the search, Jose Luis Cano agreed to speak with investigators and told them he destroyed Ortega-Lopez’s phone “by smashing it with a hammer and discard(ing) the remaining pieces in the city trash dumpster approximately five weeks ago,” adding he thought the phone “contained photos or videos that would reflect negatively” on Ortega-Lopez, the complaint against him stated.\n\nWhen questioned further, Jose Luis Cano said he destroyed the phone because he believed it contained photos of Ortega-Lopez holding firearms, the complaint stated.\n\nCNN has reached out to ICE and the US Attorney General’s Office for more information on the case.\n\nThe arrests of Jose Luis and Nancy Cano come after the former judge resigned from his role in March, according to court documents. On Tuesday, the New Mexico Supreme Court ordered Joel Cano never to hold or run for a New Mexico judicial office in the future, the documents stated.\n\nCNN’s Hanna Park, Ray Sanchez and Rafael Romo contributed to this report.', '', 'Published 10:01 PM EDT, Fri April 25, 2025', 'former-new-mexico-judge-and-wife-arrested-on-charges-of-tampering-with-evidence-linked-to-suspected-tren-de-aragua-member-1745804464');

A contingent of American Secret Service agents hovered, alert, from a distance. Dignitaries walking past gave the scene wide berth.\n\nStraining to catch a glimpse of what was happening, the visitors saw a remarkable scene unfold: President Donald Trump, knee-to-knee with his Ukrainian counterpart Volodomyr Zelensky, in their first face-to-face meeting since an explosive Oval Office row ended with the Ukrainian’s eviction from the White House 57 days earlier.\n\n“I see him as calmer,” Trump said of Zelensky the next day. “I think he understands the picture. And I think he wants to make a deal.”\n\nSaturday’s meeting underneath the Vatican vaults was a remarkable collision of diplomacy and coincidence, quietly orchestrated by both sides at a moment of reckoning in the three-year-long war, according to multiple American and European officials familiar with the matter.\n\nBehind the scenes, European officials had been encouraging a meeting between the men for days, hopeful an in-person meeting in Rome could prove fruitful at a fraught moment in negotiations to end the war.\n\nTrump’s criticism after the meeting of Russian President Vladimir Putin was his strongest to date, and sparked new hope in Ukraine and beyond that the US leader could be adopting a different approach to a conflict he once promised to end on the first day of his presidency.\n\n“I want him to stop shooting, sit down and sign a deal,” Trump said of Putin on Sunday as he returned to Washington to begin what aides say will be a critical week in determining the future of US-led efforts to broker an end to the war. “We have the confines of a deal, I believe, and I want him to sign it and be done with it and just go back to life.”\n\nWhether Trump maintains the critical approach to Putin is anyone’s guess. History has shown Trump far more conciliatory toward the Kremlin leader, sometimes echoing his talking points.\n\nAnd for all of the Vatican meeting’s symbolism — peace talks inside the marble walls where Pope Francis had once called for peace — it was far from clear afterward what if anything had actually changed in the efforts to end the war.\n\nStill, for a president who said this month he was “not a fan” of Zelensky and accused him of prolonging the invasion of his own country, it was a remarkable shift in blame after the encounter inside St. Peter’s.\n\nIt was a meeting neither side seemed certain would come to pass, and both US and Ukrainian officials were careful not to telegraph any expectations ahead of time. Heading into Rome on Friday, Trump suggested he wouldn’t have time for extensive meetings, and questioned whether it would be quite suitable to engage in foreign policy while honoring the late Pope Francis.\n\nInside the Vatican the next day, as Trump and Zelensky found themselves walking through the building at the same time, it still wasn’t clear to people watching the encounter unfold whether they would in fact sit down for talks.\n\nBut Vatican officials were quick to mobilize, bringing three chairs to a corner of St. Peter’s Basilica where Trump and Zelensky could be sequestered from fellow world leaders and speak in private.\n\nThe third chair was originally intended for a translator, one person familiar with the matter said, seeking to put to rest speculation it could have been meant for French President Emmanuel Macron, who greeted both Trump and Zelensky in the minutes before the huddle began.\n\nMacron had been among the leaders who was hoping Trump and Zelensky would be able to speak directly in Rome. But when it came time for them to sit down, Macron walked away after exchanging words with Trump, leaving the US and Ukrainian leaders to speak directly.\n\n“The thing he was determined to do was to talk to Zelensky face-to-face and talk about how we’re going to get the largest land war in Europe to an end,” US National Security Adviser Mike Waltz, who was in Rome, said on Fox News. “Both sides have to want that.”\n\nWith no aides present, the precise contours of what the two men discussed underneath a massive painting of Jesus’s baptism remain closely held. Only cursory readouts were provided afterward.\n\nBut a day later, Trump told reporters Zelensky had asked him for more weapons, which he said was typical, and said they briefly discussed the issue of Crimea — the peninsula Russia annexed in 2014, which the US would recognize as Russian under an American peace proposal.\n\nIf Zelensky had protested that concession, Trump seemed unmoved.\n\n“I don’t know how you can bring up Crimea,” he said Sunday. “That’s been a long time.”\n\nTrump’s efforts to end the Ukraine war have become a major frustration as he approaches his hundredth day in office. He has told advisers that mediating an end to the conflict is harder than he expected.\n\nSome of Trump’s advisers continue to worry they are wasting their time trying to resolve a conflict that has shown little signs of waning. Trump himself said Sunday he was “surprised and disappointed” that Russia had launched a missile assault on Kyiv as the talks were proceeding, and pondered whether Putin was “tapping” him along.\n\nPerhaps as a way to pressure both sides to reach a deal, Trump’s top diplomat suggested Sunday the end-point in US efforts was approaching.\n\n“This week is going to be really important week in which we have to make a determination about whether this is an endeavor that we want to continue to be involved in, or if it’s time to sort of focus on some other issues that are equally, if not more, important,” US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Sunday on NBC.\n\nYet for all of the difficulties in negotiating a settlement, the meeting Saturday provided at least some hope to Trump and his aides that diplomacy was possible, at least with the Ukrainians.\n\nFor his part, Trump also appeared taken by the grandeur of the setting.\n\n“It was a beautiful meeting,” Trump said in New Jersey. “I’ll tell you it was the nicest office I’ve ever seen.”\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details.', '', 'Updated 8:24 PM EDT, Sun April 27, 2025', 'how-coincidence-and-diplomacy-drove-a-consequential-meeting-between-trump-and-zelensky-inside-st-peters-1745804464'),
(49, 'Ron and Casey DeSantis were plotting a political dynasty in Florida. Then came a scandal', 'https://edition.cnn.com/2025/04/27/politics/ron-casey-desantis-florida-scandal/index.html', 'Steve Contorno', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/c-gettyimages-1258381913.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_833,w_1480,c_fill', 'Florida Governor and 2024 presidential hopeful Ron DeSantis and his wife Casey DeSantis speak to supporters during a campaign stop at The Grove on Augusta in Gilbert, South Carolina, on June 2, 2023.', 'A year after his presidential ambitions collapsed, Gov. Ron DeSantis and his wife Casey can no longer lay claim to the future of the Republican Party. And in Florida, even their present is in jeopardy.\n\nOnce firmly in his corner, many Sunshine State Republicans have lately turned on DeSantis, stymying his agenda and frustrating him to no end. At the same time, Casey DeSantis, long regarded as a political force in her own right, is encountering quiet but firm resistance as she lays the groundwork for a potential run to succeed her husband — a campaign that would pit her against President Donald Trump’s handpicked choice to lead the state, Rep. Byron Donalds.\n\nNow, a funding scandal involving one of Casey’s signature initiatives — a state assistance program known as Hope Florida — is casting a shadow over the governor’s legacy and complicating her political ambitions. Lawmakers spent the spring investigating why $10 million from a state Medicaid settlement was routed to a charity connected to Hope Florida, which then transferred the same amount to two groups that financially backed a DeSantis-led campaign against legalizing recreational marijuana. Key lawmakers have publicly suggested the flow of money appears illegal.\n\nThe couple have fiercely stood by their work and denied wrongdoing. DeSantis this week called the criticism of Hope Florida “all political.” Standing alongside her husband Thursday, Casey DeSantis characterized the program as “a philosophy” that “shows we can help people in need.”\n\nRemarkably, the investigation into Hope Florida was not by Democrats, but by Republicans — a striking sign of DeSantis’ eroding clout in a state capital he once controlled with unchallenged authority. Outside Tallahassee, some of Trump’s staunchest allies in Florida have helped to amplify the controversy to their MAGA followers.\n\nAmid the fallout, the DeSantises have grown increasingly isolated. Donors, fundraisers and operatives are fleeing their orbit, and at the moment, few in Florida politics seem willing to sign up for another campaign with the couple. Multiple people have turned down positions in a potential gubernatorial campaign, according to two sources who remain in contact with the governor’s remaining team.\n\n“These days, I can’t tell the difference between being their friend and their enemy,” a longtime Republican operative once close to the governor told CNN.\n\nEven among their remaining allies, there is a growing sense that Casey shouldn’t announce a bid until the cloud hanging over the couple is lifted, though few people are willing to share those sentiments directly with them. Earlier this year, Ryan Tyson, the pollster for DeSantis’ presidential campaign, gave the couple a blunt assessment of the hurdles Casey would face in trying to extend their political dynasty, according to one of the sources.\n\n“It wasn’t well received,” the person said, “and no one has tried to give them advice since.”\n\nAs they mount a public defense, the couple is also privately engaged in an intensifying lobbying campaign to keep Trump’s involvement in the Florida Republican primary to a minimum. Casey joined Trump for a round of golf and DeSantis was recently spotted playing with the president’s son, Eric, at Trump National Doral Miami. They also recently dined with Trump.\n\nBut soon after these engagements, Donalds accompanied Trump to a UFC event in Florida – a joint appearance that signaled to many that the overtures from Ron and Casey had fallen short.\n\nA visibly exasperated DeSantis, watching Tallahassee allies drift away from him and his legislative priorities, recently asked aloud during a press conference: “Why the hell are they doing this?”\n\nCasey DeSantis launched Hope Florida in 2021 with a mission to wean people off government assistance by connecting them with faith-based and other charitable help in their communities. It quickly became her hallmark project as she built up her profile, regularly distributing novelty checks carrying the state seal and her signature. Eventually, Casey and Ron DeSantis would tout the program in other states as they campaigned for president as a one-two punch in 2023.\n\nAround that time, the Florida Department of Children and Families created the Hope Florida Foundation, a separate nonprofit entity assigned to bolster the state program. In its first year, the foundation raised about $800,000 in donations and awarded only $40,000 in financial assistance, according to a recently released tax return.\n\nLast year, the foundation saw its coffers boom by $10 million. At the time, few people noticed. But a Florida House committee probing the organization discovered the source of the windfall: A state settlement with Centene, a Medicaid contractor that had overbilled Florida and other states. The agreement with Centene included an unusual provision that required the company to donate $10 million to the Hope Florida Foundation.\n\nWithin days of the donation, the foundation awarded two $5 million grants to a pair of political groups, according to documents first reported by the Tampa Bay Times and Miami Herald and provided to CNN by the foundation’s lawyer, Jeff Aaron. The two organizations then sent $8.5 million to Keep Florida Clean, a committee that spearheaded the successful fight last November against a ballot measure that would have amended the state constitution to legalize recreational marijuana.\n\nKeep Florida Clean was operated by James Uthmeier, the governor’s chief of staff at the time who DeSantis later named Florida’s attorney general. Uthmeier has denied any wrongdoing.\n\nAfter the election, campaign finance records show Keep Florida Clean shifted $1.2 million to the Florida Freedom Fund, a political committee controlled by the governor. The committee could ultimately be used to support Casey DeSantis’ political ambitions. A spokesperson for the governor’s political operations did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nState Rep. Alex Andrade, a Republican who led the House investigation, told CNN the money trail “looks very much like wire fraud and money laundering to me.” On Thursday, he announced his committee has concluded its work, but he has publicly encouraged law enforcement agencies to review the committee’s findings.\n\n“I hope @PamBondi is paying attention,” Andrade wrote on X, tagging Trump’s attorney general and former top prosecutor in Florida. Bondi’s office declined to comment.\n\nDeSantis contended at an appearance earlier this month that the $10 million was separate from the state settlement and “kind of like a cherry on top, where they agreed to make an additional contribution.” Bryan Griffin, a spokesman for the governor, argued that neither Ron or Casey DeSantis has a role in the Hope Florida Foundation and said the state program “has been extremely successful and has helped 30,000 Floridians reduce or eliminate reliance on public assistance.”\n\nOther elements of Hope Florida illustrate the coziness between the governor’s political orbit and his wife’s top priority.\n\nThe chairman of the Hope Florida Foundation is Joshua Hay, the CEO of Indelible Solutions, a company that the state has paid tens of millions of dollars since he joined the charity, the Times and Herald reported. His company donated $125,000 to DeSantis’ 2022 reelection. A board member for the foundation, Tina Vidal-Duart, is executive vice president for CDR Enterprises, a consulting company that donated $1 million to a Super PAC that supported DeSantis’ presidential campaign. Her husband Carlos Vidal is the company president and CEO.\n\nSeveral of the foundation’s top donors contributed to DeSantis’ political committee as well, including Centene, according to tax documents and campaign finance records.\n\nAnd then there’s Unite Us, a health technology company hired to build the web-based portal that connects people in need to local services. Unite Us rostered a noteworthy team of lobbyists that included Dane Eagle, DeSantis’ former Secretary of the Florida Department of Economic Opportunity; his former chief of staff Adrian Lukis and former deputy chief of staff Courtney Coppola. Nine days after the state executed the contract with Unite US, DeSantis’ presidential campaign announced Coppola and Eagle would serve on his national finance committee.\n\nThe state awarded the $3.9 million deal to Unite Us despite a track record of supporting initiatives that clashed with DeSantis’ crackdown on progressive priorities, like promoting transgender rights and diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives. The technology company’s positions on those issues could provide Republican foes another attack line against Casey DeSantis tied to Hope Florida.\n\nIn the past, Unite Us had publicly boasted on its website its commitment to diversity in hiring, gender neutral restrooms at its New York and Los Angeles offices and use of gender pronouns on internal communications. Days after Casey DeSantis barnstormed through Iowa in June 2023 sporting a custom-made leather jacket embroidered with the slogan “Where Woke Goes to Die,” Unite Us announced a workplace culture award, noting its DEI efforts and that most of its staff were women, non-binary and minorities.\n\n“In so many organizations, ‘diversity,’ ‘equity,’ and ‘inclusion’ are just big-ticket buzz words,” said a quote on archived web page for Unite Us. “But at Unite Us, diversity, equity, and inclusion are core to our mission.” The webpage no longer appears to be operational.\n\nThe governor’s office said he had no involvement in the awarding of the Unite Us contract. Miguel Nevarez, a spokesman for the Florida Department of Children and Families, said a team of negotiators for the contract unanimously selected Unite Us.\n\nNevarez also noted that DCF has provisions in its contracts “that restricts the use of any state funds for the purpose of promoting, advocating for, or providing training or education on “Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion.” The contract with Unite Us specified that the portal could not “list categories or subcategories related to diversity, equity, or inclusion.”\n\nClose allies of Trump are gleefully watching the funding scandal unfold. Roger Stone, Trump’s longtime political adviser, recently dissected the scandal on his podcast with the help of the Florida Democratic Party leader. Laura Loomer, a deeply devoted Trump ally and a regular DeSantis tormenter, has amplified the developments out of Tallahassee to her 1.6 million followers on X.\n\nFormer Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz, who remains close to Trump and is weighing his own gubernatorial run, has also seized on the controversy through his One America News program.\n\nDeSantis has responded with characteristically aggressive counter attacks and has accused Republican lawmakers of attempting to smear his wife for political gain. He has also sought to fundraise off the controversy, asking donors to send money to his political committee to fight “squishy” House Republicans, according to an email obtained by CNN.\n\n“Some people feel threatened by the first lady. Let’s just be clear about that,” DeSantis said at a press conference earlier this month. “If you’re looking at 2026 and you’ve got some horse, you don’t want her anywhere near that. You’re very worried because she runs circles around their people. Everybody knows that.”\n\nCORRECTION: This story has been updated to clarify the work that Indelible Solutions has done for the state of Florida.', 'A funding controversy', 'Updated 7:49 PM EDT, Sun April 27, 2025', 'ron-and-casey-desantis-were-plotting-a-political-dynasty-in-florida-then-came-a-scandal-1745804464'),

USSS said in a Sunday evening news release it made a second arrest in Miami in connection with the theft. The agency said that person “is believed to be a co-conspirator” with the primary defendant.\n\nThe arrests came after the US Secret Service launched an investigation to find the perpetrator who stole her bag as she ate dinner with her family on Easter Sunday.\n\nA spokesperson for the Secret Service initially declined to comment on the arrest, but in a statement to CNN Sunday, Washington Field Office Special Agent in Charge Matt McCool said the primary “the defendant is a serial offender.”\n\n“We have also determined that this incident had no protective nexus to Secretary Noem or her role as Secretary of Homeland Security. The investigation revealed alleged criminal activity, including potential device and credit card fraud,” McCool said.\n\nMultiple additional arrests are expected in a theft ring recently which recently targetedWashington, DC’s, Penn Quarter area, a law enforcement source familiar with the investigation told CNN.\n\nNoem thanked the Secret Service and Immigration and Customs Enforcement in a post on X on Sunday and described the primary suspect as a “career criminal who has been in our country illegally for years.”\n\n“Unfortunately, so many families in this country have been made victims by crime, and that’s why President Trump is working every single day to make America safe and get these criminal aliens off of our streets,” Noem wrote.\n\nAs CNN previously reported, surveillance footage of the incident at The Capital Burger restaurant in Washington, DC, showed the suspect purposefully moving close to Noem as he zeroed in on her Gucci bag near her feet, a second law enforcement source said.\n\nThe thief, dressed in dark clothing, sat down at an empty table next to Noem with his back facing her and used his left foot to slide the bag away, the source said. He surveyed the restaurant before eventually picking up the bag, covering it with his jacket and leaving.\n\nOnly when Noem got up from the table did she realize her bag was missing, the source said.\n\nItems inside the bag included a Louis Vuitton Clemence wallet, Noem’s driver’s license, medication, apartment keys, passport, DHS access badge, makeup bag, blank checks, and about $3,000 in cash, multiple sources said.\n\nCNN reached out to The Capital Burger’s parent company, Darden Restaurants, which did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe Secret Service was inside the restaurant with Noem, who was dining at a table with her family, according to a source familiar. The source didn’t specify how many agents accompanied Noem or where they were inside the restaurant.\n\nCommenting on the large sum of cash Noem was carrying immediately following the incident, a DHS spokesperson said: “Her entire family was in town including her children and grandchildren – she was using the withdrawal to treat her family to dinner, activities, and Easter gifts.”\n\nLaw enforcement experts have raised concerns about whether the incident, which involved a thief getting so close to a Cabinet official and then absconding with her belongings, may have been a lapse in security.\n\nSecret Service “will maintain jurisdiction over the case and intends to present its findings to a federal court in coordination with the United States Attorney’s Office for the District of Columbia,” McCool said.\n\nThis story was updated with comment from DHS Secretary Kristi Noem and to reflect that there was a second arrest.\n\nCNN’s Samantha Waldenberg, Kit Maher and Piper Hudspeth Blackburn contributed to this report.', '', 'Updated 7:13 PM EDT, Sun April 27, 2025', 'arrests-made-in-the-theft-of-kristi-noems-purse-and-thousands-in-cash-1745804465'),

Flores-Ruiz was set to be in Dugan’s courtroom for an unrelated case.\n\nDugan allegedly demanded that the agents leave a public hallway in the courthouse and said they required a different type of warrant to make the arrest, according to the documents. She then allegedly directed Flores-Ruiz and his attorney to leave through a “jury door,” which leads to a nonpublic area of the courthouse, court documents say.\n\nColón, a sitting judge, said Dugan’s arrest is an example of the Trump administration wanting the judicial system to “essentially succumb to their power and their policy priorities independent of Constitutional rights and what other rights people have.”\n\n“I think what they want to do is to essentially have the judiciary not only in Wisconsin but the independent judiciaries of the state … essentially succumb to their power and their policy priorities independent of Constitutional rights and what other rights people have,” he said.\n\n“That’s not the way we do business in a democratic, in a democratic country.

I expect that victims will be afraid to come to court.”\n\nWhen asked by Lah why Americans should care about Dugan’s arrest amid the influx of news coming out of the White House, Colón issued a stark warning on the threat the Trump administration poses to democracy.\n\n“Why should you care?” Colón asked, “Because if our Constitutional structure continues to fray in the way they are intentionally fraying it, we will not have a working democracy.”\n\nCNN’s Hannah Rabinowitz, Michael Williams and Devan Cole contributed to this report.', '', 'Published 2:00 PM EDT, Sun April 27, 2025', 'trump-administration-is-sending-a-message-to-chill-the-judiciary-with-wisconsin-judges-arrest-her-peer-says-1745804465'),

It comes during an already unprecedented string of events for young people — people in their early 20s are earning less and have more debt, already battered by the Covid-19 pandemic and an onslaught of inflation.\n\nSo, the United States might not be in a recession right now, but its youngest working adults are still anxious — and seeking advice from their older peers.\n\nWhen scrolling through TikTok, Sasha Whitney, 37, noticed Gen Z users shared the same feelings over an impending recession: “downtrodden, frustrated, very bleak and hopeless about the future.”\n\nIt’s a stark difference from when Whitney graduated from college in 2009 during the Great Recession, before social media became as pervasive and when Barack Obama, who ran his campaign on the concept of hope, just took office.\n\n“When I talked to some of my millennial friends, they were like, ‘Yeah, we were broke. We were struggling,’” said Whitney, whose primary audience on TikTok is aged 18 to 25 years old. “However, we weren’t trying to keep up with the Joneses. You weren’t trying to portray a lifestyle for social media.”\n\nOther millennials joked on social media about the sense of community they had during the recession, sounding nostalgic for the days of cheaper liquor, wearing business casual and endless replays of feel-good recession pop. “If you want to know how we survived, yeah we blacked out,” one millennial user quipped on TikTok.\n\nBut millennials did share their real financial struggles. After graduating, Whitney lived at home for a bit, then moved out, paying rent and student loans and leaving $20 a week for groceries. She worked in retail immediately out of college and figured out how to handle her finances through trial and error.\n\n“I’m buying packs of tuna, frozen vegetables, bread, putting it in the freezer. That’s when it really hit me that something’s going on,” she said.\n\nWhitney’s TikTok video walked viewers through some recession tips, including: taking whatever job you can get, living below your means, and deleting payment platforms like Klarna and After Pay. Other videos from millennials on TikTok offer recession preparation guides, such has having an emergency savings fund and updated resumes.\n\n“If I can give somebody advice, especially younger folks, that’s what I’m going to do,” Whitney said.\n\nMany TikTokers are vowing to do one thing: limit their spending.\n\nFor Imani Smith, a 29-year-old in Dallas, that means password-sharing subscriptions with her friends and cutting back on going out to eat.\n\nBeauty maintenance is also a high cost, so she buys press-on nails from Amazon instead of going to the salon. Salon owners are reporting more requests for “recession blonde,” cheaper, more low-maintenance hairstyles.\n\nAnd despite the famous lipstick index — the theory that small “treat yourself” purchases uptick during economic downturns — social media users have promised to cut out small purchases like expensive lip balms and candles.\n\n“I want to (save) and build a practice of doing it before I have to do it out of basic necessity,” Smith, who described herself as in between a Gen Z and millennial, told CNN. She added that she uses TikTok, like many young people, as a search engine. In a video on TikTok, she asked viewers who were adults in 2008 whether her recession plan was good enough.\n\nWhen people sense their budgets contracting, they have to decide what they’re going to spend on, Simon Blanchard, a professor at Georgetown University’s McDonough School of Business, said to CNN. He added it may be a good time to self-reflect if you have enough emergency savings, whether we’re in a recession or not.\n\nPeople tend to cut an entire category of spending rather than a little bit of everything, so it doesn’t seem like they have to downgrade on every part of their life, Blanchard said.\n\n“And maybe those small indulgences like lipstick are the things that might be first to go because they’re just non-essential,” Blanchard said.\n\nDespite the advice from millennials to let go and live, as all the great music of the mid-2000s encouraged, anxiety still persists among many young people.\n\nAfter talking to people who lived through 2008, Smith said that “they might’ve lost their jobs, but the cost of living was so low back then that they could have picked up something retail and held themselves afloat for a while,” emphasizing her worries for the job market right now.\n\nFor many young people, their anxiety goes back to the Covid-19 pandemic. Smith had just started working her first corporate job when the pandemic hit, triggering the shortest recession in US history that ended after two months in April 2020.\n\n“It put me in the mindset that I need to be prepared for anything,” Smith said. “Because none of us could have anticipated Covid-19 and the lasting effects that had.”\n\nCNN’s Lacey Russell contributed to this report.', 'Living below your means', 'Updated 12:23 PM EDT, Sun April 27, 2025', 'millennials-are-giving-gen-z-advice-for-their-first-potential-recession-1745804465'),

Recession fears and a stock market sell-off that has eaten into many would-be buyers’ savings have heightened disruptions in the real estate market.', 'A few weeks ago, Los Angeles real estate agent Scott Price got the kind of call that’s only happened once before in his two-decade-long career: His buyer was backing out — just two days before closing.\n\nTo Price, the reason seemed to be a growing uneasiness with the economy. Price’s client, warned by his company that layoffs may be coming, no longer felt secure enough to make such a large purchase. Rather than take the risk, the buyer walked away from the home — and their 3% deposit.\n\n“This is not a common occurrence for me,” Price said about the transaction falling through. “It was a very unusual event.”\n\nThough deal cancellations may not be common for Price, they are happening more frequently around the US. In the four weeks between March 17 and April 13, more than 14% of all home purchase agreements in the US were canceled, according to data provided to CNN by Redfin. That’s the highest level for this time of year since 2020, when the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic froze the housing market.\n\nPresident Donald Trump’s on-again, off-again approach to tariffs this month has led economists to warn that everything from footwear to furniture may soon see price hikes, and some anticipate a recession could occur as soon as this year. But real estate agents say they may already be feeling the effects of economic uncertainty today.\n\nEven before Trump’s April 2 announcement of sweeping tariffs, homebuying in 2025 was off to a slow start. Sales of previously owned homes, which make up the vast majority of the market, dropped 5.9% in March from the prior month, according to the National Association of Realtors. That was the weakest pace of home sales in March since 2009.\n\nStill, many had hoped this year’s busy springtime homebuying season would be an improvement after the pace of national home sales nearly ground to a standstill in 2024, but recession fears and a stock market sell-off that has eaten into many would-be buyers’ savings accounts have heightened the disruptions in the real estate market.\n\n“First-time homebuyers have been a little more skittish,” Maddy Mixter, a Realtor based in Tacoma, Washington, said. “I think there is anxiety around if the markets will rebound and that makes younger buyers even more hesitant to cash out stocks right now.”\n\n“I think, for the most part, people are kind of taking a step back or being really cautious in their moves in the real estate market,” she added.\n\nEver since Trump announced his “reciprocal” tariffs on all imports to the US, later instituting a 90-day pause on many of the highest tariffs (with the exception of China), stock and bond markets have experienced massive swings.\n\nThe bond market directly affects home borrowing rates. Mortgage rates track the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield, which spiked as high as 4.5% in the weeks after Trump’s initial tariff announcement. As a result, the average rate on a standard, 30-year fixed mortgage experienced the largest one-week jump in nearly a year last week.\n\n“Mortgage rates are a huge factor, especially for first-time homebuyers who are really trying to thread the needle of affordability right now,” Mixter said. “Every tenth of a point increase is a big deal.”\n\nThose who may have been saving up to buy a new home by investing in the stock market may be disappointed by the recent performance in their portfolio: The Dow tumbled 9.1% in the first three weeks of April, the index’s worst performance for any April since 1932.\n\nAt a time when someone’s finances — or career prospects — might be in flux, Douglas Boneparth, certified financial planner and the founder of wealth management firm Bone Fide Wealth, advises waiting on making a large purchase like a new home.\n\n“It’s a case-by-case basis,” he said. “There may be individuals out there who, regardless of uncertainty, have strong savings or feel fine about their job.”\n\nFor those who plan on buying a new home in the near future, Boneparth suggests being more conservative with investments and ensuring that savings aren’t exclusively invested in stocks.\n\n“If you have a short-term goal, like buying a home in the next handful of years, the money that you need to facilitate that transaction, like a down payment, closing costs, furnishing, moving, all that stuff, that shouldn’t be fully invested in the stock market,” he said. “We need to make sure we have the resources available for that decision.”\n\nThere’s another way the Trump administration’s trade policies are already impacting the spring home market, though. Tariffs on imported construction goods and appliances have changed the calculation for buyers looking to purchase fixer-upper homes, said Matthew Bizzarro, a Realtor who works primarily in New York City and Westchester, New York.\n\n“The main talk I’ve heard about tariffs is from folks who are buying places that need to be gut-renovated,” Bizzarro said. “Some have started to feel concerned about the cost of goods to renovate and that’s creating pause.”\n\nMixter, the real estate agent in Washington, also said many of her first-time homebuyers are no longer considering homes that will require renovations.\n\n“Classically, starter homes need a little bit of shining up,” she said. “But I’ve seen a lot of first-time homebuyers that are really cautiously looking at homes that they could just move right in to… just because of the climate and the uncertainty of what’s happening moving forward.”\n\nHowever, there are some outliers. Mixter said her office has seen interest in real estate purchases among some older homeowners who recently cashed out some stock holdings amid market gyrations.\n\nFor now, they see real estate as a sound investment alternative, she said.', 'What to do if your nest egg is tied up in stocks', 'Published 9:00 AM EDT, Sun April 27, 2025', 'tariffs-and-stock-market-volatility-are-clouding-spring-home-shopping-season-1745804465'),

Imports arriving at the country\'s busiest seaport could see a slowdown by May as orders are paused in response to President Donald Trump\'s tariffs on China and other countries.', 'In 2017, Christina and Ian Lacey decided to take a chance and leave their stable careers to turn their hobby into a small business.\n\nThe risk and hard work paid off. The Denver couple started Retuned Jewelry from their home and have seen impressive returns — averaging $360,000 in annual sales, most of which stemmed from frequenting music and art festivals.\n\nChristina, a former dental assistant, and Ian, who previously worked in information technology, handcraft donated guitar and bass strings into earrings, necklaces and bracelets.\n\n“We’ve worked 24/7 on this,” Christina told CNN. “This is our baby. We’ve pushed through burnout just to keep it alive.”\n\nBut all the hard work may fall to the wayside due to President Donald Trump’s 145% tariffs on Chinese imports, which accounted for nearly $440 billion in goods to the United States in 2024. While businesses of all sizes are impacted by tariffs, smaller operations — like Retuned Jewelry — are more exposed, according to John Arensmeyer, founder and CEO of Small Business Majority, an advocacy group that represents a network of 85,000 small businesses.\n\nHe said small businesses will have to raise prices, cut staff, delay growth plans or shut down entirely just to keep up with the rising costs of imports they can’t source domestically.\n\n“Small businesses have thinner margins and less leverage to negotiate with suppliers,” Arensmeyer told CNN.\n\nWhile the Laceys rely on free strings that otherwise would end up in landfills, the other materials they rely on — beads, chains, clasps and hooks — come from China. Ian said they’ve tried sourcing materials domestically, but those products simply aren’t made in the United States.\n\n“We’ve looked,” he said. “There’s no facility here that makes what we need.” The Laceys have already raised prices on their products ahead of the tariffs.\n\nArensmeyer said small businesses usually don’t have the cash reserves to ride out unexpected price hikes. He said the tariffs amount to a crisis for small businesses, one where “they don’t have much control.”\n\nFor the Mitchell Group — a second-generation, family-owned textile company based in Niles, Illinois — the lack of cash reserves could have serious effects during production hiccups or other problems.\n\n“Because of our business model, tariffs have put a serious strain on our cash flow,” said Ann Brunett, the company’s chief operating officer. “We typically keep goods on hand. So, I’m paying a 45% tariff — plus duty — to bring in products that might sit on a shelf until our distributors need them. That ties up our cash.”\n\nThe Mitchell Group employs 18 full-time staff and 12 sales representatives, and generates just under $10 million in annual revenue, according to its president, Bill Fisch.\n\nBrunett said the company will do “everything we can” to avoid shutting down. She said that the business “means everything to us” and that the company wants to avoid laying off their staff.\n\nFisch has explored Vietnam, India, Malaysia and even Europe as production alternatives. “No one has the infrastructure China does,” he said. “We need our coated fabrics produced under one roof and to our exacting standards. You can’t make one part in Vietnam, another in India and assemble in Thailand. It doesn’t work.”\n\nWhile Trump has touted tariffs as a way used to bolster domestic manufacturing, Arensmeyer said an increase in US production could take a long time to come into fruition.\n\n“You can’t fix that overnight,” Arensmeyer said. “You can’t just say, ‘Oh, we’re going to have a tariff, and now people are going to buy domestically,’ when we don’t have those products being made domestically.”\n\nThe textile and apparel industry has steadily declined in the United States over the past several decades, largely due to the rise of cheaper overseas production and globalization, according to Sheng Lu, a professor at the University of Delaware’s Department of Fashion and Apparel Studies.\n\nFisch said key materials the Mitchell Group uses, like specialized vinyl polymers and textiles, are virtually nonexistent in the United States. China is the world’s largest textile producer, manufacturing everything from cotton and silk to synthetic fibers and vinyl polymers.\n\nHe added that he isn’t able to find enough workers to staff a fabric factory in Mississippi.\n\n“The textile business for our kind of product?

Investors are ringing alarm bells with the assets they’re buying and mostly selling – and suddenly making comparisons to the Great Depression. And everyone from the International Monetary Fund to Trump’s billionaire friends are issuing stark warnings about his massive tariffs.\n\nHere’s what you might have missed this week.\n\nPresidential relationships can change, but Trump has taken that to an extreme.\n\nAfter calling the Fed chair (whom he appointed in 2018) “a major loser” whose “termination cannot come soon enough last week, Trump seemed to soften up on Tuesday. He said he had “no intention” of firing Powell after advisers warned that terminating the central bank chief would backfire legally and economically, sources familiar with the matter told CNN.\n\nBut the president’s outlook soured by Wednesday.\n\n“I haven’t called him. I might call him,” Trump said in an Oval Office executive action signing ceremony Wednesday evening. “I believe he’s making a mistake by not lowering interest rates, and I think, as well as we’re doing, we could do much better.”\n\nOn Wednesday, Trump said he could reimpose “reciprocal” tariffs on some countries in as soon as two or three weeks. The president had set a 90-day pause on his massive so-called reciprocal tariffs, which aren’t technically reciprocal, earlier this month to spur negotiations with other countries.\n\n“In the end, I think what’s going to happen is, we’re going to have a great deals, and by the way, if we don’t have a deal with a company or a country, we’re going to set the tariff,” Trump said in an Oval Office ceremony. “I’d say over the next couple of weeks, wouldn’t you say? I think so. Over the next two, three weeks. We’ll be setting the number.”\n\nIf he reimposes the tariffs, it would be a significant re-escalation in the global trade war.\n\nThe stock market has been on a rollercoaster this week.\n\nInvestors started with a steep Monday sell-off after Trump’s attacks on Powell. The dollar tumbled to a three-year low, and nearly every company in the Dow and the S&P 500 closed lower.\n\nShares modestly rebounded Tuesday after Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told investors that the US-China trade war is unsustainable and that he expects the battle to de-escalate, a person familiar with the matter confirmed to CNN.\n\nStocks soared on Wednesday, but Trump still has a long way to go to ease investors’ fears. Despite the two-day rally, the S&P 500 has shed $6.5 trillion in market value since its record high in February, according to Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices.\n\nMeanwhile, US crude oil has tumbled as investors fear a recession could tank demand. And US Treasury yields, which trade in opposite direction to prices, have surged in recent weeks.\n\nThe IMF released a stark warning for the global economy and US prosperity in a Tuesday report.\n\n“We are entering a new era as the global economic system that has operated for the last 80 years is being reset,” the IMF said, predicting rapidly slowing economic growth – particularly in the United States – and reignited US inflation.\n\nSouth Korea’s Customs Service also reported that exports for the first 20 days of April declined by 5.2% compared to the same period last year – a sign for where global trade is heading under Trump’s tariff agenda.\n\nBillionaires are becoming more and more vocal about the economic consequences of Trump’s tariffs.\n\nHedge fund Citadel CEO Ken Griffin, a supporter of the president, said Wednesday that tariffs are hurting America’s position in the world.\n\n“The United States was more than just a nation. It’s a brand. It’s a universal brand, whether it’s our culture, our financial strength, our military strength,” Griffin said at the Semafor World Economy Summit in Washington. “And we’re eroding that brand right now.”\n\nGriffin joins the list of wealthy business leaders diverging from the president.

The school called the closure a “very difficult decision,” but offered little explanation, in a message to the hundreds of families that it serves across two campuses.\n\nThe closure comes amid bigger shifts by CZI and its namesake leaders, and as Big Tech broadly repositions itself in the era of President Donald Trump.\n\nParents were told that the school was shuttering because CZI was withdrawing its support, according to reports from the San Francisco Standard and the New York Times. A representative for the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative told CNN that the school’s board of directors made the decision and pointed to its statement, but did not respond to an additional question about the group’s funding for the school. CZI plans to donate $50 million to the communities and families affected by the closure, the school said in its note this week.\n\nCarson Cook, the Primary School’s senior manager of strategy and advancement, confirmed in an interview with CNN that the school began meeting with parents to inform them of the closure last Thursday and said those conversations are ongoing. But he declined to comment on the reasons behind the closure or the timing.\n\n“At the Primary School, our model has always been one that carefully considers the needs of the whole family, and we want to do our absolute best to ensure that every child and their caregiver is supported,” Cook said. “And I think what we just want to say is that that hasn’t changed.”\n\nCook declined to comment on CZI. The philanthropy has recently undergone a series of significant changes. In February, the organization told employees it would cut internal and external diversity, equity and inclusion efforts.\n\nThat followed a similar move a month earlier by Zuckerberg’s company Meta — one of several Trump-friendly changes the social media giant has made since the start of this year. Zuckerberg and Chan also attended Trump’s inauguration, where they were seated prominently among other Big Tech leaders.\n\nWhen Chan and Zuckerberg founded their philanthropy initiative in 2015 — at the same time that Zuckerberg pledged to give away 99% of his Facebook fortune — they did so with four goals: personalized learning, curing diseases, connecting people and community building.\n\nThe group said it was dedicated to improving health outcomes and invested in other education projects and immigration and criminal justice reform efforts. The Primary School was among the first of those investments.\n\nIn a column for CNN the year after the Primary School’s founding, Chan wrote that the organization wanted to address “toxic stress” among children that can be caused by abuse, neglect or poverty. She said the school’s early success proved that “children and adults can build resilience and thrive even in the face of trauma.”\n\nThe Primary School had become a model for other organizations — just last month, its medical director hosted a session at the SXSW conference about how integrating early childhood education and healthcare could help “the most vulnerable children and families.” More than 95% of the school’s students are “underrepresented minorities,” the Primary School reported in a 2023 tax filing.\n\nThe school’s unique approach involved pairing parents with “parent wellness coaches,” in an effort to support not just kids, but whole families. Cook said those coaches will work directly with parents to explore other schooling options for their children after the Primary School closes next year.\n\nIn the years after the school was founded, as Meta grew and gained influence, Zuckerberg and Chan continued to speak out about social issues.\n\nIn 2017, Zuckerberg pledged to visit and meet with people in every US state — even sparking rumors that he might make a bid to challenge Trump for the White House in 2020. Then in 2020, he and Chan expressed “disgust” and called for “unity” after Trump’s inflammatory remarks about nationwide protests against racial injustice.\n\nBut Zuckerberg has since made somewhat of a political about-face.\n\nLast summer, Zuckerberg called Trump a “badass” after he survived an assassination attempt. The CEO later visited Mar-a-Lago as he angled for an “active role” in the president’s policy discussions, and he donated $1 million, through Meta, to Trump’s inauguration. Meta has also shelled out $25 million to settle the lawsuit Trump brought against the company for suspending his account after the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol — $22 million of which will help fund a forthcoming Trump presidential library.\n\nAnnouncing major policy updates ahead of Trump’s inauguration in January, Zuckerberg said the new administration represented “a real opportunity” for change at Meta.\n\nThen in February, CZI announced it would focus on science and “wind down” its investment in “social advocacy.” That included cutting work on “immigration reform, as well as our racial equity grantmaking,” it said, along with its internal DEI programs\n\nFor families at the Primary School, CZI’s abrupt decision to shut its doors marks another way tech giants like Meta have reshaped their community — and not always for the better. For years, Bay Area residents have complained that as Silicon Valley grew, the influx of highly paid tech workers created a housing shortage and priced lower-income people out of the area.\n\nOne parent told the San Francisco Standard that the school had been a “gift to the community” in the wake of the housing crisis. “Now they’re gonna take this away too,” she said.\n\nAs for the Primary School’s staff, Cook said they are focused on the year they have left with students.\n\n“We have an incredible staff and the fact that we have one more year with our families just invigorates and motivates us to provide them with the best year of school and programming that we possibly can,” he said. “Our team cares very deeply about our children, our families and about this community.”', 'Changing philanthropy focus', 'Published 5:01 PM EDT, Fri April 25, 2025', 'a-tuitionfree-school-created-by-mark-zuckerberg-and-priscilla-chan-will-shutter-next-year-1745804465'),

But the mystery of who may have killed Boston Police Officer John O’Keefe on a frigid night in Canton lingers as jurors visited the house near where his body was found.\n\nO’Keefe’s girlfriend, Karen Read, was back in court Friday for her second murder trial, accused of killing O’Keefe with her Lexus SUV.\n\nRead has pleaded not guilty to second-degree murder, vehicular manslaughter while intoxicated and leaving the scene of a collision resulting in death. Her first murder trial ended in a mistrial last year after the jury said it could not reach a unanimous verdict.\n\nAround midday Friday, jurors boarded a bus from the courtroom in Dedham and made the roughly 20-minute journey to the house in Canton, about 20 miles south of Boston.\n\nThat’s where O’Keefe’s body was found in the snow blanketing the front of the house in the predawn hours of January 29, 2022. Shards of glass and splotches of blood were found nearby.\n\nBefore traveling to the house Friday, Judge Beverly Cannone told jurors that she and attorneys on both sides of the case would join them.\n\n“I have to make something very clear: The purpose of this view is to help you better understand the evidence you will hear at trial and help you appreciate the location and surroundings,” Cannone told the jury.\n\n“The observations that you make while on the view may be used and considered by you in your deliberations in reaching a verdict,” the judge said. “Also, while you are on the view, you are not to take any notes or photographs. You are not to conduct any investigation in this case. You really are simply to stop and look.”\n\nThe prosecution and defense each told the jury what they believed jurors should pay attention to at the scene.\n\nWhen jurors arrived at the home, Read’s black Lexus LX 570 was parked outside – but in a different spot from where jurors from Read’s first murder trial saw it when they visited the house last year, CNN affiliate WCVB reported Friday.\n\nInstead of being near the end of the driveway, the SUV was parked near the flagpole where O’Keefe’s body was found.\n\nProsecutors say Read struck O’Keefe with her SUV after dropping him off at a party and returned hours later to find him dead. Defense attorneys say Read was a victim of a conspiracy involving the police.\n\nThe night before O’Keefe was found dead, he and Read went out drinking at two bars with friends.\n\nShortly after midnight, the couple climbed into Read’s SUV and drove to the Canton home of O’Keefe’s colleague for an after-party. There, O’Keefe got out of the vehicle, and Read later drove home.\n\nEarly the next morning, Read and two friends drove around in a snowstorm looking for O’Keefe and found his body in the front yard of the Canton house, according to court documents.\n\nProsecutors say Read’s SUV had a broken taillight, and pieces of it were found outside the Canton home.\n\nBut in Read’s first trial, the defense theorized O’Keefe was beaten in the home and mauled by the homeowners’ German shepherd, Chloe, and then tossed out in the snow to die. The police then conspired to fabricate evidence and lie under oath to protect their own, the defense alleged.\n\nA medical examiner determined O’Keefe suffered multiple skull fractures consistent with blunt-force trauma that led to bleeding in the brain.\n\nHe also had two swollen black eyes and several abrasions and scrapes on his right arm, the autopsy found. Hypothermia was a contributing factor in his death, the autopsy said.\n\nDuring opening statements this week, special prosecutor Hank Brennan said the state’s case will rely on “facts, science and data” and told jurors they will hear Read’s own public statements about the case in recent media interviews.\n\nBrennan described comments from a Canton firefighter and paramedic who responded to the scene and found O’Keefe’s body. After the paramedic asked Read what happened, the prosecutor told jurors, “You’ll hear her words … ‘I hit him, I hit him, I hit him.’”\n\nParamedic and firefighter Jason Becker testified Friday that Read told him her last conversation with O’Keefe, who Becker said Read referred to as her “husband,” was an argument.\n\n“I didn’t feel like it was my role to really find out the details on what was said, but that’s what she said to me,” Becker said.\n\nDefense attorney Alan Jackson said the trial will show O’Keefe wasn’t hit by a vehicle.\n\nJackson accused Massachusetts State Police Trooper Michael Proctor, the lead investigator who has since been fired, of lying and fabricating evidence. Jackson told jurors that during the first search of the house, police didn’t find any pieces of taillight around O’Keefe. However, Jackson said, after Proctor took possession of the vehicle, about 46 pieces of “bright red taillight” started “magically showing up” in places already searched by officers.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional information.\n\nCNN’s Elise Hammond, Eric Levenson, Braden Walker, Dakin Andone and Faith Karimi contributed to this report.', 'What we know about the house and the couple’s last night', 'Updated 6:20 PM EDT, Fri April 25, 2025', 'jury-in-karen-reads-murder-trial-visits-the-home-where-boyfriend-and-police-officer-john-okeefe-was-found-dead-outside-1745804465'),

All incidents of gun violence are included if they occurred on school property, from kindergartens through colleges/universities, and at least one person was shot, not including the shooter.

Accidental discharges of firearms are included, as long as at least one person is shot, but not if the sole shooter is law enforcement or school security.\n\nIn the first year of the pandemic, when schools were closed, there was a major decline in gun violence incidents on school grounds. Since then, recent years saw a stark increase in school shootings, with 2021, 2022, 2023 and 2024 all setting records since at least 2008. There were at least 83 incidents in 2024, but 2022 was one of the deadliest years, with 47 fatalities, according to CNN’s analysis. That year saw the shooting at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas, where 19 students and two educators were killed and more than a dozen others were injured.\n\nStudents and educators have engaged in activism around the issue of gun violence, and some educators have quit the profession.\n\nSome states in the south have seen the highest rate of school shootings relative to their populations since 2008, according to CNN’s analysis. Washington, DC had the highest rate — 6 total shootings, almost 1 per 100,000 people — while Texas had the most overall with 62 school shootings.

He scribbled on a yellow legal pad at times during the 30-minute hearing, seated between two of his lawyers.\n\nBesides federal charges, the defendant also faces state charges in New York, where Thompson died, and Pennsylvania, where Mangione was arrested – and officials had previously said his New York state case would proceed first.\n\nBut in Friday’s arraignment, his attorney Karen Friedman Agnifilo said she will ask that his federal trial start first, citing the Justice Department’s announcement a day earlier that it intends to seek capital punishment for his top federal charge – murder through use of a firearm. The department’s announcement came weeks after Attorney General Pam Bondi directed the office to seek the penalty.\n\nIn his New York state case, Mangione would face a maximum sentence of life in prison if convicted, according to prosecutors. Details about when Mangione’s legal team would request the change in the order of his trials weren’t immediately available.\n\nMangione’s next hearing in the federal case is scheduled for December 5, when a trial date will be set, Judge Margaret Garnett said Friday. She expects the trial to begin in 2026, she said.\n\nFriday’s court appearance comes about a week after a federal grand jury indicted Mangione on the four federal charges in the December 4 killing of the insurance executive.\n\nThe targeted shooting of Thompson, who was on his way to a UnitedHealthcare investors’ conference in New York, has led to an outpouring of support for Mangione from people with deep frustration and anger at the American for-profit health care system.\n\nOutside the courtroom Friday, supporters of Mangione gathered, some wearing green – a reference to Nintendo’s “Luigi” character – and holding banners, with messages like “Luigi Before Fascists” and “Stop the Violence: End the Death Penalty Now.” Critics also appeared: One person displayed what seemed to be a fake skeleton dressed in a green shirt and blue overalls – clothes in the style of the Nintendo character – in a mock electric chair.\n\nMangione’s last court appearance in February similarly drew a sizable contingent of supporters.\n\nIn New York, he has pleaded not guilty to state murder and terror charges. In his Pennsylvania case, he faces firearm and forgery charges in connection to the 3D-printed firearm and false identification allegedly in his possession when he was arrested at a McDonald’s in Altoona. He did not enter a plea in Pennsylvania before he was extradited back to New York to face charges there.\n\nAn attorney for Mangione filed a series of motions in Pennsylvania state court seeking to dismiss the charges against him there, and suppress several pieces of evidence should the case go to trial. His lawyers said Mangione was illegally stopped and searched by authorities and requested that Mangione’s recovered writings not be referred to as a manifesto.\n\nThe charges stem from the December 4 shooting of Thompson in Midtown Manhattan that set off a five-day manhunt.\n\nMangione was arrested in connection with the killing in Pennsylvania, more than 270 miles away from the shooting. He allegedly possessed on him the fake ID used by the suspect, the gun they believe was used in the shooting and a handwritten “claim of responsibility,” authorities have said.\n\nMangione was not insured by UnitedHealthcare, but at the time of his arrest, he allegedly had a handwritten notebook that expressed “hostility toward the health insurance industry and wealthy executives in particular,” according to a federal complaint. Notably, three 9mm shell casings from the crime scene had the words “delay,” “deny” and “depose” written on them, the NYPD has said, an apparent nod to a 2010 book critiquing insurance industry tactics.\n\nMangione has garnered support from some who see the American health insurance industry as broken, overly expensive and quick to deny coverage. The majority of insured US adults had at least one issue with their health insurance within the span of a year, including denial of claims, according to a survey released in June 2023 by nonprofit health policy research group KFF.\n\nMangione, born and raised in Maryland, was valedictorian at a prestigious Baltimore private school before studying computer science at the University of Pennsylvania. When his name was published shortly after his arrest, onlookers and journalists alike rushed to scrutinize his prolific social media presence: He had written online about years of debilitating back pain and publicly kept track of nearly 300 books he had read or wanted to read, even posting a review of the Unabomber manifesto on Goodreads.\n\nA couple weeks before the shooting, Mangione’s mother had reported him missing to authorities in San Francisco, where he lived after stints in Hawaii and traveling in Asia.\n\nAs of Friday, a legal defense fund in support of Mangione has raised more than $900,000.\n\n“To be honest, I’m really not that surprised that all this widespread support has sort of risen up in this moment for this young man alleged to have taken action in this way,” Sam Beard, spokesperson for the December 4th Legal Committee – the group fundraising for Mangione – previously told CNN’s Laura Coates.\n\n“I think Americans are fed up with the way of the – that the health insurance system operates,” Beard added.\n\nMeanwhile, mainstream politicians have lambasted Mangione’s alleged actions as horrific crimes and said he should face serious consequences.\n\n“In America, we do not kill people in cold blood to resolve policy differences or express a viewpoint,” Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro said the same day Mangione was apprehended. “He is no hero.”\n\nThe sharply polarizing views on his case have made Mangione a particular focus of public attention.\n\nIn December, Mangione was whisked from Pennsylvania to downtown New York on a jet and a helicopter in a remarkable spectacle in front of media cameras. Once in New York, a handcuffed Mangione was led on a lengthy “perp walk” by a swarm of heavily armed NYPD officers, with New York Mayor Eric Adams and NYPD commissioner Jessica Tisch right behind them.\n\nThe defense has accused law enforcement and prosecutors of inappropriately playing to the television cameras in that incident.\n\nMangione’s February 21 court hearing in New York on state charges drew dozens of his supporters despite frigid temperatures and long lines to enter the courtroom.\n\nSome wore “Free Luigi” scarves and “Free Luigi” sweaters, and they chanted slogans supporting him and criticizing the American health care industry.\n\nChelsea Manning, the former United States Army soldier and whistleblower convicted of violating the Espionage Act after leaking documents to WikiLeaks, was spotted among the attendees that day, and also appeared outside his Friday federal hearing.\n\nMangione himself wore a green sweater in the February court hearing – a fashion choice that prosecutors said the defense made intentionally. The defense “has on the one hand cried foul when entities outside the People’s control have made public statements or gestures, while on the other has itself fanned the flames of the public attention,” prosecutors wrote in a recent filing.\n\nFurther, prosecutors revealed that Mangione’s attorneys provided him a new pair of argyle socks that contained hidden heart-shaped notes of support. Mangione’s attorneys later said they “inadvertently did not see” the notes in the socks.\n\nUltimately, Mangione did not wear those socks during the hearing.', 'How we got here', 'Updated 4:01 PM EDT, Fri April 25, 2025', 'luigi-mangione-pleads-not-guilty-to-federal-charges-in-killing-of-unitedhealthcare-ceo-1745804465'),

Super, a professor of administrative and constitutional law at Georgetown and Yale, told CNN.\n\nWhether the government can impose broad demands on Harvard as a precondition for funding appears to be the latest Trump controversy inevitably headed for the Supreme Court. And while predicting what the high court will do is usually a fool’s errand, Georgetown Law professor Steve Vladeck believes Harvard’s case is strong.\n\n“It’s not that controversial a proposition that the government’s not allowed to say in exchange for this money – which we’re going to give you to fund medical research, to fund new scientific methods, etc. – you have to only teach the classes we tell you to teach or you have to only hire the administrators we tell you to hire,” the CNN contributor told the network’s Laura Coates on Monday.\n\nThe Administrative Procedure Act, known as APA, was passed in the wake of World War II, as the government struggled to manage the major expansion of federal agencies under President Franklin D. Roosevelt.\n\n“Congress passed the APA to guard against irrational, emotional, unfounded decision-making,” Super said. “Its purpose is not to push any particular agenda substantively but to make sure that the executive branch is following the law and considering the facts before it acts.”\n\nThe APA does not require a hearing for every decision made by a government agency, but it does say agencies should not suddenly change procedures without reason.\n\nHarvard argues suspending federal medical and scientific research funding as a way to combat antisemitism doesn’t make any sense and upends official procedures they had come to expect with no warning.\n\n“For decades, Harvard has relied on the well-established process for federal financial assistance in its budgeting and financial planning, including with respect to staffing, infrastructure, facility and equipment purchases, and long-term investment decisions,” the university said in its suit.\n\nWhile the Trump administration asserts Harvard has allowed antisemitism to flourish in violation of the Civil Rights Act, the university says it is already addressing concerns from Jewish students and faculty by tightening its ban on encampments and other protests that disrupt student activities, making “doxing” a violation of its anti-harassment and anti-bullying rules and expanding “inclusion and belonging efforts” to include Jewish students.\n\nFurther, Harvard says the Civil Rights Act requires the government to first give it a chance to fix any violations before taking federal money away.\n\n“Agencies have to follow their own procedures. If they say they’re going to give you a warning, they have to give you a warning,” Super said. “They can’t say, ‘Well, we’re mad, so we’re going to bypass the warning.’”\n\nIn its lawsuit, Harvard argues the Trump administration did just that: “They issued a Freeze Order on research funding first (with no process or opportunity for voluntary compliance) and used that freeze as leverage to negotiate,” Harvard’s attorneys wrote. “Such action is flatly unlawful and contrary to statutory authority.”\n\nIndeed, the university learned the billions in federal funding would be frozen at the same time everyone else did – in the final 26 words of a one-page news release from the government’s Task Force to Combat Anti-Semitism, it says. The release was issued on the same day Harvard President Alan Garber announced the school would not agree to the administration’s demand letter.\n\nThe Trump administration’s attorneys have not yet provided a response to the allegations in the lawsuit, but White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said Tuesday, “The president has made it quite clear that it’s Harvard who has put themselves in the position to lose their own funding by not obeying federal law, and we expect all colleges and universities who are receiving taxpayer funds to abide by federal law.”\n\nHarvard’s decision to challenge the funding freeze in court seemed to take the administration by surprise. One White House official considered the back-and-forth with Harvard all part of a negotiation, they told CNN, and Education Secretary Linda McMahon said in a CNBC interview, “We would like to be able to move forward with them and other universities.”\n\nBut along with the carrot, the White House official continued to brandish a stick at Harvard.\n\n“They want to remain the envy of the world when it comes to research and science and academia, and they can only do that if they work with this administration,” the official told CNN.\n\nHarvard is far from the only group affected by the Trump administration’s orders to mention the APA when fighting back in court. More than 160 lawsuits have cited alleged violations of it, from complaints over international students facing deportation and fired federal workers to transgender students’ access to sports.\n\nLawsuits challenging the finer points of federal law often take years to resolve, but Harvard is asking a judge to speed up the process, saying time is of the essence to avoid harm to their programs.\n\n“While Harvard is diligently seeking to mitigate the effects of these funding cuts, critical research efforts will be scaled back or even terminated,” the university’s lawyers wrote Wednesday in a court filing asking for an expedited hearing.\n\nWith so many lawsuits pending, the question of how much the APA can limit the White House is almost certain to be decided by the Supreme Court. An early ruling from the justices indicated that, despite showing sympathy to APA-based challenges in the past, citing that law is not a guarantee of success.\n\nEarlier this month, they blocked a lower court’s order to delay the Trump administration’s planned termination of $600 million in teacher training grants to states, saying the APA does not necessarily give courts the power to force the government to pay grant money.\n\n“The Government is likely to succeed in showing the District Court lacked jurisdiction to order the payment of money under the APA,” said the unsigned order from the conservative majority.\n\nIt was a 5-4 ruling, with conservative Chief Justice John Roberts siding with the court’s three liberal justices, a split that makes future decisions in similar cases even more difficult to predict.\n\nThe issue at the heart of the teacher grants case – with states arguing withholding grant money over diversity, equity and inclusion policy amounted to a broken promise from the government rather than a First Amendment dispute – is different than Harvard’s.\nBut it shows the rocky road anyone challenging the White House’s administrative decisions could face, perhaps including Columbia University, which cut its own deal last month over federal funding tied to policy demands over antisemitism.\n\nStill, education advocates say, it’s worth facing the legal uncertainty to draw a line in the sand.\n\n“Harvard did absolutely the right thing. They came up with a very courageous decision, and more importantly, I think, they made great arguments for why this kind of federal overreach is beyond the pale,” said American Council on Education President Ted Mitchell.\n\nAnd the extreme speed of the actions of taken against Harvard – the unapologetic pace Trump prizes – is likely to be the government’s legal undoing, Super said he believes.\n\n“These actions are so sloppy that I don’t see any serious chance that they’ll survive,” he said.\n\nCNN’s Katelyn Polantz, Tierney Sneed and Betsy Klein contributed to this report.', 'Why the Administrative Procedure Act could be key in court', 'Updated 9:51 AM EDT, Fri April 25, 2025', 'a-blandly-titled-law-from-1946-may-play-a-key-role-in-harvards-lawsuit-against-the-trump-administration-1745804465'),

An estimated 800,000 Tutsis were killed during the three-month-long genocide. The indictment of the Bridgehampton man was unsealed in Central Islip on Long Island.\n\nAt an initial court appearance, Nsabumukunzi pleaded not guilty to visa fraud and attempted naturalization fraud and was released on $250,000 bail. The bail package requires home detention and GPS monitoring, but he will be allowed to continue working as a gardener.\n\nEvan Sugar, a lawyer for Nsabumukunzi, described his client in an email as “a law-abiding beekeeper and gardener who has lived on Long Island for more than two decades.”\n\nHe said Nsabumukunzi was “a victim of the Rwandan genocide who lost scores of family members and friends to the violence.”\n\nSugar said Nsabumukunzi was rightfully granted refugee status and lawful permanent residence and planned to “fight these 30-year-old allegations” while maintaining his innocence.\n\nIn a detention memo seeking detention, prosecutors said interviews of witnesses who knew him in Rwanda indicated that Nsabumukunzi falsely assured Tutsis at public meetings when the genocide began that they would be protected.\n\nBut, they said, he then, in private meetings, urged Hutus to begin killing Tutsis, the memo says.\n\nProsecutors said witnesses told them that Nsabumukunzi not only participated in the killing of Tutsis, including in his administrative offices, but he also encouraged Hutu men to rape Tutsi women as a genocidal tool.\n\nProsecutors said that when the charges were described to Nsabumukunzi as he was arrested Thursday morning, he responded: “I know I’m finished.”\n\nAccording to the indictment, Nsabumukunzi was sentenced to life in prison after he was convicted on genocide charges in absentia by a Rwandan court. He’d been accused of using his leadership position to oversee the killings of Tutsis in his local area.\n\nHe allegedly set up roadblocks during the genocide to detain and kill Tutsis and participated in killings, the indictment says.\n\nIn 2003, Nsabumukunzi applied to settle in the US as a refugee and received a green card in 2007 before applying for citizenship in 2009 and 2015, authorities said.\n\nIn his applications, they added, he falsely asserted that he was not involved in the genocide.\n\nMatthew R. Galeotti, head of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division, said in a release that Nsabumukunzi participated in “heinous acts of violence abroad and then lied his way into a green card and tried to obtain U.S. citizenship.”\n\n“For over two decades, he got away with those lies and lived in the United States with an undeserved clean slate, a luxury that his victims will never have,” said U.S. Attorney John J.

The individuals whose homes were searched were not arrested, though some were detained and later released, officials said.\n\nThe search warrants were executed as part of the Michigan Department of Attorney General’s investigation into at least 12 “coordinated and related” acts of vandalism and property damage that occurred in multiple Michigan counties between approximately February 2024 through March 2025, officials said. The estimated cost of the damage is about $100,000, according to authorities.\n\n“These search warrants were not investigative of protest activity on the campus of the University of Michigan nor the Diag encampment; today’s search warrants are in furtherance of our investigation into multijurisdictional acts of vandalism,” the attorney general’s office told CNN Wednesday, adding that local, state and federal authorities were involved in the searches.\n\n“Political slogans or messages” were placed at every vandalized site, the attorney general’s office said. Graffiti displayed pro-Palestinian messages at most of the sites, photos show.\n\nSeveral University of Michigan administrators were among those targeted.\n\nThe home of Erik Lundberg, the university’s chief investment officer, was vandalized with the words “Divest” and “Free Palestine.” University of Michigan President Santa Ono’s home was vandalized with graffiti that included the word “intifada” in part. The home of Jordan Acker, a member of the university’s Board of Regents, was also damaged – with a window broken and the words “Free Palestine” written on his car. His law firm was also vandalized with pro-Palestinian language. Photos of provost Laurie McCauley’s home likewise show shattered glass and the words “No honor in genocide” graffitied on her fence.\n\nNo charges have been filed against any of the people whose homes were searched, authorities said. The attorney general’s office did not identify any suspects in the investigation.\n\n“The University of Michigan condemns these criminal acts in the strongest possible terms,” the school said in a December statement after Acker’s home was vandalized. “They are abhorrent and, unfortunately, just the latest in a number of incidents where individuals have been harassed because of their work on behalf of the university. This is unacceptable and will not be tolerated.”\n\nThe Maurice & Jane Sugar Law Center for Economic & Social Justice, which is representing two of the individuals whose homes were raided, said most are University of Michigan students. When asked about the vandalism at Acker’s home, the lawyers denied that their clients were involved.\n\nJohn Philo, the legal director at the law center, told CNN ﻿Thursday that the individuals are being targeted for their pro-Palestinian beliefs.\n\n“The students that were targeted appear to be those that UM officials believe are most active in on-campus protests - protests that have been loud at times…but which in no way can be characterized as violent or causing significant vandalism,” Philo said. “Other than a shared viewpoint concerning Palestine, a real question exists as to why student campus protestors are being targeted or is that the point - because they are expressing that viewpoint on UM’s campus.”\n\nThe incidents followed months of tensions between the university’s administration and pro-Palestinian students who had in 2024 demanded university leaders divest from Israel amid its war in Gaza.\n\nOther instances of vandalism and property damage occurred at the Jewish Federation of Detroit, an officer’s home, a country club, a car dealership, an office and the historic Wilcox House, according to the attorney general’s office.\n\nThe alleged vandalisms were committed in the middle of the night, and in one instance, children were sleeping at a residence but were awoken, according to the attorney general’s office. Windows were smashed in several cases and “noxious chemical substances were propelled” into homes on two occasions.\n\nThe TAHRIR Coalition, a pro-Palestinian student organization at the University of Michigan, said FBI agents, the Michigan State Police and local police officers detained but later released six activists whose homes were searched in Ann Arbor and Ypsilanti. Personal belongings and electronics were also confiscated, according to the organization. At a third residence in Canton, no individuals were detained. At least one of the individuals was required to have a DNA sample taken, according to Philo.\n\nAt one of the homes searched Wednesday, police forcibly entered after they negotiated entry for more than an hour to satisfy the search warrant, the attorney general’s office said.\n\nGraduate Employees’ Organization, a union representing graduate workers at the University of Michigan, said one of its members was among those detained and released and “executors of the search warrants were reluctant to reveal their warrants or their reason for visiting these activists.”\n\n“We strongly condemn the actions taken today and all past and present repression of political activism,” the union said in a news release. “We urge University of Michigan administrators, the Regents of the University of Michigan, and Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel to end their campaign against students and stop putting graduate workers in harm’s way.”\n\nPhilo said that the multi-agency response to alleged vandalism was unwarranted.\n\n“None of these students have any [history] of violence, none have prior criminal records, and none have been charged. They are 17-22 year olds and very much college students or recent grads,” Philo said. “Why were three or more police agencies at every home?

The agent “believed there was a flight risk and arrest was necessary,” and put him under arrest, the document says.\n\nKhalil’s attorneys responded to the government’s claims by pointing to video of the arrest, which shows Khalil did not attempt to flee or refuse to cooperate with agents as they placed him in handcuffs.\n\nThe DOJ submitted documents to a New Jersey court Thursday, with both sides sparring over whether a warrant was needed to arrest Khalil, a legal permanent resident.\n\n“The Trump administration’s latest motion shows that they are steadfast in smearing Mahmoud Khalil to justify his horrific and unconstitutional abduction. We have the receipts: Mr. Khalil was taken from his family with no warrant and in clear retaliation for his protected speech,” Veronica Salama, staff attorney at the New York Civil Liberties Union said in a statement. “We will continue to fight for Mr. Khalil’s freedom and defend the right to speak freely about Palestinian rights without fear of detention and deportation.”\n\nCNN has reached out to the White House for comment.\n\nThe documents were filed in response to a request from New Jersey federal district court Judge Michael Farbiarz, who directed Khalil’s legal team and attorneys for the Department of Justice to submit all filings that were presented in Khalil’s immigration case, which is playing out in a Louisiana immigration court.\n\nCNN has reached out to Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the Department of Homeland Security, but has not heard back.\n\nKhalil has two parallel cases playing out in two separate courts: an immigration case in Louisiana and a federal case in New Jersey where his attorneys are challenging the legality of his detention and seeking his release on bail.\n\nThe legality of Khalil’s detention is central to the case currently unfolding in New Jersey, where his attorneys have petitioned the court for his release.\n\n“They further do not dispute that they had no warrant at all, neither judicial nor administrative, when they arrested Mr. Khalil in his private apartment building. Instead, without pointing to a single piece of evidence, they falsely contend that Mr. Khalil refused to cooperate with agents, and this supposed failure to cooperate justified their warrantless arrest,” Khalil’s attorneys wrote.\n\nKhalil, a Columbia University graduate who played a prominent role in helping organize protests against the Israel-Hamas war on the campus of Columbia last year has been in custody in Louisiana since March.\n\nLouisiana Assistant Chief Immigration Judge Jamee Comans found Khalil should be deported during proceedings earlier this month after the government submitted evidence to support Khalil’s deportation, which consisted of a two-page memo from Secretary of State Marco Rubio saying the pro-Palestinian activist is deportable because his “beliefs, statements or associations” would compromise US foreign policy interests.\n\nRubio’s determination was also cited by attorneys who told the court they were not required to obtain a warrant after Rubio’s directive was issued.\n\n“Given the agents’ interaction with the respondent and the information received regarding removability and the Secretary of State’s determination, the agents had reason to believe that the respondent was likely to escape before a warrant could be obtained,” attorneys for the Department of Justice wrote.\n\nThe documents also reveal immigration officers were surveying Khalil’s movements prior to the arrest as part of an effort to establish what attorneys for the Department of Justice describe as a “pattern of life.” It was during that surveillance that officers received notice that a charge of removability under the Immigration and Nationality Act had been approved and supported by the Secretary of State.\n\nKhalil’s attorneys and the government were facing a deadline to submit additional documents to the immigration court this week. Judge Comans had ordered the parties to submit any additional evidence or motions seeking relief.\n\nAttorneys for Khalil told CNN Thursday he has applied for asylum with the court, which remains sealed due to the sensitive nature of the request.\n\nIt’s not entirely clear why New Jersey district court Judge Farbiarz requested to see evidence submitted in the immigration case.\n\nDuring a hearing with the parties last week, Farbiarz said he was still weighing whether he had jurisdiction to rule on multiple motions before him – including a motion to release Khalil on bail, a motion to compel the government to return him to New Jersey, and a motion seeking a preliminary injunction that would release Khalil from custody.\n\nIf Farbiarz grants the preliminary injunction it would also block the Trump administration from targeting other noncitizens who have engaged in protest activity for deportation.', '', 'Published 9:54 PM EDT, Thu April 24, 2025', 'mahmoud-khalils-attorneys-and-doj-spar-over-whether-a-warrant-was-needed-to-arrest-him-court-documents-reveal-1745804465'),

About two hours after the texts went out, Serena Longley, the college’s vice president and general counsel, sent an email Monday to faculty and staff stating, “Barnard was not given advance notice of this outreach.”\n\nTwo days later, the school explained in another email to employees it was aware of access to personal contact information being granted to the EEOC, but maintained it did not know the survey was being sent out.\n\nBarnard said the EEOC’s commissioner, Andrea Lucas, initiated an investigation last summer against the college concerning whether it “discriminated against Jewish employees on the basis of their national origin, religion, and/or race in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964,” according to the email.\n\nThe college told its employees Wednesday it has been “robustly defending” itself against the inquiry, but said the EEOC was legally entitled to gain access to contact information for Barnard’s employees so the commission “could offer employees the option to voluntarily participate in their investigation,” the email stated.\n\n“Barnard complied with this lawful request,” the college said in the email.\n\nThe surveys come as the Trump administration takes aim at higher education institutions in the US in an effort the administration says is to fight antisemitism and address what President Donald Trump has called “Hamas sympathizers” on college campuses.\n\nSeveral Barnard staff members told CNN the college has their personal contact information in case of emergency only. “The cellphone belongs to me, it doesn’t belong to Barnard,” said Nara Milanich, chair of the school’s history department.\n\nMilanich, who is Jewish, said she “didn’t even know it was legal” for the school to turn her information over.\n\nAnother staff member who received the text, and who wished to remain anonymous out of concern for their job, expressed fears it might not just have been their own information that was shared with the government.\n\n“It would be one thing if they gave them my office number, but they gave them my cellphone number, and who knows what else? I’m concerned that they may have given the numbers of my emergency contacts and my loved ones, who have nothing to do with any of this. I’m worried if they gave other personal identifying information about me,” the staff member said.\n\n“There’s a lot that I don’t know and that I am very disheartened by.”\n\nThe survey that was sent to employees at both schools recommended that respondents not reply to it during work hours or on company-supplied equipment.\n\nStill, the perceived breach of privacy has rattled the recipients. The survey also asked for specific information about identifying when the respondents began working for the school, and who their supervisors are.\n\n“Barnard seems perfectly willing to do anything that it can to appease an administration that is interested in inserting itself and taking over our college and telling us who to teach and how,” Becher said.\n\nThe administration has been vocal about being against pro-Palestinian student protests that have broken out on various college campuses – including Columbia – since the Israel-Hamas war began.\n\nTrump signed an executive order highlighting measures to combat antisemitism on campuses during his second week in office.\n\nAnd last month, Columbia was listed as one of 60 universities under investigation by the Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights warning them of “potential enforcement actions” if they failed to protect Jewish students on their campuses under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act.\n\nThe EEOC responded to CNN’s request for comment on the surveys, stating in an email, “Per federal law, we cannot comment on investigations, nor can we confirm or deny the existence of an investigation.”\n\nColumbia declined to comment on a pending investigation, a university spokesperson told CNN.\n\n“I think there’s a troubling dynamic in which administrators and faculty, who should be on the same side of this whole challenging moment that we are in, are not working together,” says Milanich. “We should be working together to defend our institution and defend the values of our college, but this feels like more evidence for that not happening as it should.”\n\nCNN’s Kaitlan Collins, Rene Marsh, Karina Tsui and Elizabeth Wolfe contributed to this report.', '', 'Published 7:59 PM EDT, Thu April 24, 2025', 'federal-agency-texts-columbia-university-and-barnard-college-employees-a-survey-asking-if-they-are-jewish-1745804465'),

They have also filed several other motions challenging the death penalty, including one based on purported violations by the state in providing evidence.\n\n“Mr. Kohberger’s autism spectrum disorder (ASD) reduces his culpability, negates the retributive and deterrent purposes of capital punishment, and exposes him to the unacceptable risk that he will be wrongfully convicted and sentenced to death,” defense attorneys wrote in court papers.\n\nThey argued that executing someone with autism would constitute cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth Amendment to the US Constitution.\n\nProsecutors argued that under US Supreme Court precedent, the only mental disability that precludes imposition of the death penalty is an intellectual disability — and Kohberger’s diagnosis was of mild autism “without accompanying intellectual … impairment.”\n\nKohberger was a criminal justice graduate student at Washington State University, in Pullman, about 10 miles (16.1 kilometers) from Moscow, at the time of the killings in November 2022.

People standing next to Ben Gvir shout “whoa” as they realize items are being thrown.\n\nBen Gvir was not injured and is in “good health,” his office said.\n\nIn a separate video viewed by CNN, at least one person is seen being detained by police. CNN has reached out to New Haven police for comment and details about detainments or arrests.\n\nWhen the event began earlier Wednesday evening, protesters crowded the sidewalk outside the gated building while chanting “Free Palestine,” “From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free” and “Yale, your hands are red.” As attendees made their way into the venue, protesters yelled “shame” repeatedly and booed.\n\nMitchell Dubin, a Yale senior and member of the Shabtai Society, told CNN “Shabtai does not seek to legitimize or delegitimize world leaders. Instead, it provides a space where ideas are interrogated with rigor, policies are challenged with integrity, and civil discourse is preserved even under strain.”\n\nRenewed protests have spread at college campuses this spring over Israel’s handling of its war in Gaza.\n\nThe war started after Hamas, the militant group that has controlled Gaza since 2007, killed 1,200 people in Israel in a series of gruesome attacks and took hundreds of others hostage in October 2023.\n\nBut international groups have said Israel’s attacks in Gaza have killed tens of thousands of Palestinians – mostly women and children – and caused an ongoing humanitarian crisis.\n\nPro-Palestinian demonstrators also gathered at Yale University on Tuesday night to protest Ben Gvir’s visit.\n\nA Yale spokesperson told CNN an “unregistered group” of 200 people not “affiliated with any recognized student organization” gathered Tuesday and set up eight tents in Beinecke Plaza, a central square on Yale’s campus.\n\nThe group disbanded at 11 p.m. Tuesday after “university officials articulated Yale’s policies and the consequences of violating them” and offered a final warning, the Yale spokesperson said in a statement to CNN.\n\nProtesters were given cards with QR codes that linked to Yale University’s policies for peaceable assembly, such as keeping everyone physically safe, not blocking entrances and exits and not disrupting the university’s operations.\n\nSome students who were warned by campus officials in previous incidents that violated school policy were given written notices and “are subject to immediate disciplinary action,” the spokesperson said. But the university didn’t say how many received such notices.\n\nTuesday’s protest came shortly after the group met with Yale officials to discuss recent campus policy violations and were “warned that further violations would jeopardize the group’s privileges,” the university said.\n\nYale has since revoked the group’s status as a registered student organization, as officials say they are also investigating concerns about “disturbing antisemitic conduct at (Tuesday’s) gathering,” the university said Wednesday.\n\n“Yale condemns antisemitism and will hold those who violate our policies accountable through our disciplinary processes,” the statement said.\n\nA statement from Ben Gvir’s office said the protesters were there “in an attempt to prevent a speech by the Minister of National Security, Itamar Ben Gvir – who was invited to speak at the venue.”\n\n“The event is taking place against the backdrop of a round of diplomatic meetings that the minister is holding in the US, after speaking at President Trump’s mansion in the past 24 hours, and the day before at a meeting with Jewish communities in the US,” the statement said.\n\nOn Thursday, the Joint Task Force to Combat Anti-Semitism said in a statement it is “cautiously encouraged by Yale’s actions and will be keeping an eye on the situation and aftermath.” The university took several actions to handle the situation, including enforcing “time, place, and manner policies,” starting discipline investigations for students who did unlawful conduct and de-registering a participating student group, the federal task force said.\n\nBen Gvir – a far-right firebrand – has been public about his adoration for US President Donald Trump, proudly extolling his plan to resettle Gazans outside of the Palestinian territory.\n\nHe quit Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government in January because he was opposed to the ceasefire deal that saw the return of Israeli hostages from Gaza in exchange for the release of Palestinian prisoners and detainees. He only rejoined the government last month when Israel resumed its war in Gaza.\n\nBen Gvir has previously been convicted for supporting terrorism and inciting anti-Arab racism, and he was considered so extreme that the Israeli military rejected him from service. This is his first visit to the United States as national security minister.\n\nLast October, a group of 90 congressional Democrats urged President Joe Biden to sanction Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich, both of whom lead extreme nationalist parties within Netanyahu’s government. Ultimately, the Biden administration chose not to impose sanctions on Israeli government ministers.\n\nThe new protest on the New Haven campus comes exactly a year after 45 protesters were arrested and charged with criminal trespassing when they refused orders to leave Beinecke Plaza, part of a wave of demonstrations across US campuses last spring.\n\nAs part of their support for Palestinians in Gaza, protesters at the Yale campus demanded the university get rid of investments in businesses with connections to Israel’s military effort there.\n\nIn recent weeks, another Ivy League university, Harvard, has been at the forefront of the Trump administration’s effort to stop campus protests, contending they are examples of antisemitism.\n\nThe Trump administration is demanding Harvard give it access to all university reports on antisemitism and anti-Muslim bias on campus generated since October 2023, as it ramps up a confrontation with the school that risks billions in federal money amid a broader push to bring elite US colleges in line with its political demands.\n\nCNN’s Brad Lendon, Oren Liebermann, Taylor Romine, Diego Mendoza, Eugenia Yosef, Martin Goillandeau and Hanna Park contributed to this report.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional information.', 'Israeli official was convicted for supporting terrorism', 'Updated 6:32 PM EDT, Thu April 24, 2025', 'palestinian-supporters-confront-farright-israeli-security-minister-as-he-leaves-an-event-near-yale-1745804465'),

We sat down and we said, ‘Okay, that’s really affected us,’” Priddle told CNN.\n\n“We can deploy dogs in the UK to track people … to look for drugs, firearms and explosives, so why could we not look at developing the dogs that we were training for conservation efforts?”\n\nThe duo has since sent 15 dogs to five sub-Saharan African countries, including Mozambique and Tanzania, each one bred by them in southwest Wales.\n\nThey usually breed one or two litters each year. Dutch shepherds and Belgian Malinois are two of the most common breeds for tracking, while labradors and spaniels are typically the detection (sniffer) dogs of choice.\n\nTraining begins from as early as two days old. Priddle acknowledges that sounds young, but he believes early imprinting programs can provide a strong foundation for the formal training that commences around six weeks later.\n\n“There’s a lot of scientific study out there that’s been documented on exposing puppies to touch, different temperatures, different surfaces and textures, as well as different odors that we put into the whelping box when they’re very young,” he explained\n\n“It just helps their brain and (helps) their synapses to fire. We see a lot of advancement in those puppies.”\n\nThe curriculum closely follows that of the typical police or security dog, focusing on obedience, tracking, and scent detection – a skill used to sniff out rhino horn, elephant ivory and bushmeat.\n\nThe only key difference to the training process is acclimating dogs to the sights, sounds and smells of lions, giraffes and the myriad other species they will help protect. With rhino and elephant numbers severely lacking in the wetlands of Carmarthenshire, trips to local zoos are organized to desensitize the puppies to African wildlife.\n\nTypically, after 16 to 18 months, dogs are ready for assignment. Even though Priddle accompanies each one on the long flight to their new home, spending the first month with the anti-poaching unit to provide field and animal welfare training to rangers, goodbyes never get easier.\n\n“The transition from spending every waking moment with that dog, having a very strong relationship, to then letting that go is challenging and difficult,” Law said.\n\n“But as much as it breaks my heart when they go, I know they’re going for the greater good.”\n\nEasing the pain are WhatsApp group chats set up for Priddle and Law to keep in touch with and advise APUs across the various reserves and conservancies.\n\nThey are particularly active forums, especially given that the organization also provides training and consultancy to teams with existing dog units, such as the Akashinga Rangers, Africa’s first armed all-female anti-poaching squad, who watch over Zimbabwe’s vast Phundundu Wildlife Area.\n\nNaturally, updates of success are a source of immense personal pride for the pair back in Wales. Shinga’s tracking triumph in October followed the achievements of fellow Belgian Malinois Dan, which in 2013 alerted his team to a rhino calf that had been caught in a snare trap in KwaZulu-Natal Province, South Africa.\n\nSuch victories demonstrate the “game-changing” value such dogs can have when incorporated into conservation efforts, argue the duo, even through their mere presence.\n\n“When these reserves bring a specialist dog onto a wildlife reserve … the word spreads very quickly that the APUs now have the capability to actually catch these poachers on a more efficient and successful basis,” Priddle said.\n\n“Some of the smaller wildlife reserves almost eradicate poaching in all types completely, just because of the deterrent value that dog brings to the party.”\n\nAs park manager and head of anti-poaching operations at Zimbabwe’s 10,000-acre Imire conservancy, Reilly Travers has had a front row seat for the last seven years to the impact of Shinga and also Murwi, a Dutch shepherd whose training was paid for by the fundraising efforts of pupils of the local Harare International school.\n\nCapable of covering as much as 10 kilometers (6.2 miles) an hour when tracking, even in darkness, dogs allow rangers to “own the night,” Travers explained, adding an invaluable level of versatility and unpredictability to their arsenal.\n\nAnd on numerous occasions Shinga and Murwi have alerted units to potentially mortal threats – be it from poachers or predators – through body language alone.\n\n“They’ve saved our guys on the ground on several occasions and they’ve been responsible for apprehending quite a few poachers,” Travers told CNN.\n\n“It’s had a massive impact on security for Imire. We’ve had a drastic reduction in poaching and the K9 unit has a massive role to play in that … It’s not the silver bullet but it’s a tool that will make a significant difference.”\n\nZimbabwe once boasted thousands of rhinos, yet numbers nosedived to less than 450 by 1992 because of poaching networks, according to conservation charity Save the Rhino.\n\nThe efforts of Imire, which saw the birth of its 23rd rhino in 2023, helped the country’s rhino population climb back over the 1,000-mark in 2022, but statistics continue to make for grim reading across the wider continent.\n\nThough the numbers of African rhinos poached annually has dropped steadily since a peak of over 1,300 in 2015, almost 600 kills were still recorded last year, according to Save the Rhino. It contributed to an overall decline in the total African black rhino population in 2023, though white rhino numbers are on the rise.\n\nAnd the impact of each loss extends far beyond statistics, Priddle and Law explain, especially at the smaller reserves that Dogs4Wildlife focuses on, which have markedly less anti-poaching resources than the continent’s most renowned parks.\n\nRecalling the sight of a de-horned 25-year-old bull rhino and eight-year-old male in Limpopo, both killed by a single poacher, Law stressed the knock-on effect on the wider environment.\n\n“The vegetation they clear, the seeds they disperse, all the other animals that are impacted. You think it’s just a rhino that’s gone – it’s the whole ecosystem that suffers,” Law explained.\n\n“The owners of that reserve had a relationship with that bull for 25 years – we grieve when we lose a dog after 10 to 15 years. For us to experience the impact that losing those two rhinos had on the reserve owner sort of gave us added motivation.\n\n“It was just horrific. I never want to see that again.”\n\nAs Dogs4Wildlife looks ahead to its long-term goal of one day opening a specialized training and canine school within Africa, mobilizing future generations has become a key part of its overall mission.\n\nIts Conservation club, called Siyafunda Ngemvelo – which translates to “we learn in nature” in IsiZulu – has taken more than 180 South African children into reserves as part of a wildlife education program.\n\nLaw said that for local people to want to protect rhinos, they must first see the animals’ value to the environment.\n\n“We have to start at the fundamental basics, which is children taking responsibility for their own wildlife,” she added.\n\n“Once they get the passion for it, they’re going to become future rangers, not future poachers.”', 'Puppy love', 'Published 4:28 AM EDT, Wed April 23, 2025', 'meet-the-welsh-puppies-that-are-stopping-wildlife-poachers-in-africa-1745807748'),

Each had at least one child \"disappeared\" by the military regime.', 'Ana María Careaga was just 16 when she was kidnapped, stolen by the regime then running Argentina. To her mother, Esther Ballestrino de Careaga, it was as if she had vanished.\n\nIt was an event that would change not just the lives of both the women and the daughter Ana María was carrying, but the future of Argentina. And it was something a priest named Jorge Bergoglio would never forget.\n\nIt was 1977 and Argentina was under the grip of a military dictatorship following a coup the year before. Those who opposed the regime were abducted, tortured, and killed – victims of what would become known as the “Dirty War.”\n\nThere was no notification or public record of the detentions, and families had no idea what had happened to their loved ones.\n\nBy the time Ana María was seized, her brother-in-law had already disappeared. Soldiers took her to the clandestine detention center known as El Atlético, where she was tortured – even after she told her captors she was three months pregnant.\n\nAlthough the extrajudicial kidnappings were becoming increasingly common, families did not speak of them — until mothers took a stand.\n\nOn April 30, 1977, a dozen or so women, each the mother of a missing child, gathered in Plaza de Mayo, the grand square in front of the Casa Rosada presidential palace in Buenos Aires. They were ordered to disperse, but instead linked arms and continued to walk slowly around the square.\n\nEach Sunday, more women would come to join in, soon to include Esther who became one of the leaders of Las Madres de Playa de Mayo (the Mothers of Playa de Mayo.)\n\nEsther knew Bergoglio long before he had even joined the priesthood. She had been his boss while he was a high schooler working a technical internship at a laboratory.\n\n“He says she taught him the culture of work,” Ana María told CNN on Thursday, standing in Buenos Aires’ ornate Santa Cruz Catholic Church. “He says she sent him to get some tests done and he brought back the results very quickly.” She questioned him on his speedy work, and he revealed that the tests were coming out the same, so he merely copied them out. “She told him, ‘You have to do it right,’ and sent him to do it again,” Ana María said. It’s an account Bergoglio confirmed after he became Pope Francis, and the two stayed in touch as he joined the priesthood and rose to become a leader of Argentina’s Jesuit community.\n\nWhile Ana María was detained — always chained and blindfolded, she said — her mother and other members of the movement met in a back room at the Santa Cruz Church in downtown Buenos Aires.\n\nAna María turned 17 while still in captivity, and she was released on September 30, 1977, by then seven months pregnant.\n\nWithin days of a medical check arranged by her mother, she left for Sweden, where she was granted asylum.\n\n“That was the last time we saw each other,” Ana María said. “We wrote letters to each other, and in one letter she tells me that when I was kidnapped, she was like an automaton, thinking about (me) the whole time. She left in the morning and came back at night, out all day with the mothers searching, searching, searching.”\n\nEven when her daughter was safe, Esther kept campaigning for those who had become known as the “disappeared.”\n\n“When she returned to the plaza after I was released, the mothers asked her, ‘What are you doing here if you’ve already recovered your daughter?’” Ana María told CNN. “And she said, ‘I’m going to continue until they all appear, because all the disappeared are my children.’”\n\nTo Ana María, and perhaps to the priest who’d befriended her mother, it was a reflection that “the struggle wasn’t just individual, but a collective one.”\n\nMonths after her daughter’s release, in December 1977, Esther and others met as usual at Santa Cruz when they were betrayed. Stepping out of the church, she and others were abducted.\n\n“They had been taken to … a clandestine center for torture and extermination, and then they were thrown alive from the ‘death flights,’ which was the final solution they (the regime) boasted of having found to get rid of the bodies,” Ana María said. The “death flights” where prisoners were killed by being tossed from a plane over land or sea is now a documented horror of the Dirty War.\n\nMany bodies were never recovered, but days after she disappeared, the remains of Esther washed up on land.\n\n“What the Mothers say is that the sea did not want to be an accomplice and returned the bodies,” Ana María said.\n\nEsther’s remains were unidentified though and buried in a mass grave.\n\nAna María did not know of her mother’s disappearance until she called to tell her of the birth of her granddaughter, the baby carried while she was detained.\n\n“She was born on December 11, and we called on December 11, 1977, to say that she had been born, and that’s when we found out that my mom had been kidnapped three days earlier,” she said. “My mom didn’t know that she had been born safely.”\n\nAs Archbishop of Buenos Aires, Bergoglio testified about Esther during a 2010 trial related to Dirty War atrocities. In an excerpt posted on YouTube by journalist Uki Goñi, he said he had known her for more than 20 years.\n\n“It caused me great pain,” Bergoglio said of learning of her abduction. “I tried to get in touch with relatives, I wasn’t able to. They were mostly … in hiding.”\n\nHe said he had tried to speak to people who could help but had not approached the authorities. His actions or lack thereof during the Dirty War hung around him as unanswered questions, even as the Vatican dismissed allegations against him.\n\n“I did what I could,” he told the trial. “I remember her as a great woman.”\n\nDecades later, long after the fall of the military regime in 1983, the remains from the oceanside mass grave were identified, and found to include Esther.\n\nFamilies petitioned Bergoglio to allow them to be buried not in a cemetery, but outside the Church of Santa Cruz — the last place they had walked free.\n\n“He said it was an honor,” Ana María told us. “He remembered his friend Esther and said it was an honor and authorized it so we could, as the faithful of this church say, sow them in the last free land that their feet trod.”\n\nTo commemorate her mother and all the others who challenged the regime, April 30 is now recognized as the founding of the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo.\n\nThe Vatican publicized a message then Pope Francis sent to Ana Marìa in 2018 to play on a radio show she hosts. “I very much remember your mother,” he said then. “She worked hard, she was a fighter and together with her many women who fought for justice, both because they had lost their children or simply because mothers who, seeing the drama of so many missing children, came together to fight for this as well.”\n\nStanding just off the main altar inside Santa Cruz Church, Ana María calmly pulled out her replacement phone — her original had been recently stolen. Fortunately, her WhatsApp messages had been backed up, preserving the Pope’s words, and her memories.\n\nShe still has that recording on her phone. In it, the Pope tells her: “I’m glad you follow these footsteps of your mother and that you broadcast it to others in your radio show. So today, in a special way, I pray for mothers, I pray for you, I pray for your mother Esther, and I pray for all the men and women of good will who wish to carry forward a project of justice and fraternity among all. May God bless you all.”\n\nEsther Ballestrino de Careaga never met her granddaughter. But Pope Francis did, spending about an hour with her last year when she visited Rome, her mother said, proudly showing a video of the two together. “He knew the whole story because my mom told him everything they had done to me, the torture, everything,” Ana María said.\n\nAs another April 30 anniversary approaches, Ana María has only memories now of her mother and the Pope.\n\nOf her mother, she said: “I have a very vivid memory of a very loving, hard-working, and committed person. I feel she left me with many values, and she’s present in our history because disappearance generates that — disappearance is the permanent presence of an absence.”\n\nShe carries a directive from the Pope as well.\n\n“When my daughter went to see him last year, he told her that we had to continue bearing witness,” she said. “We, right now in Argentina, are going through a very difficult time, and I say … we need to remember again.”\n\n“Everything that happened, the 30,000 disappeared, and how the Mothers created a civilizing pact in this country, a social contract of ‘never again.’ And that’s why it’s so important to preserve memory, which was also what the Pope said: that memory had to be preserved.”', '‘The disappeared are my children’', 'Published 6:00 AM EDT, Sun April 27, 2025', 'pope-francis-used-whatsapp-to-stay-connected-to-torture-survivor-of-argentinas-dirty-war-1745807748'),

But some of the faithful here believe he sent a final message home, in the unlikeliest but perhaps most appropriate of ways.\n\nFrancis was a lifelong soccer fan — and occasional youth goalkeeper — and a card-carrying member of his favorite club, San Lorenzo.\n\nAnd it’s the number on that card that’s become the talk of Buenos Aires.\n\n“It has to be destiny,” said Ramiro Rodríguez, who arrived wearing a rosary over his team shirt at a small chapel that’s the spiritual birthplace of the club, for a Mass to celebrate the life of Francis.\n\nThe number that’s causing the stir is assigned to “regular member” Jorge Mario Bergoglio, the Pope’s birth name: 88235.\n\nAnd as person after person has pointed out, Francis was 88 when he died, at 2:35 a.m. Argentina time on Easter Monday.\n\nFor Rodríguez, it was another otherworldly, even divine, connection.\n\n“I went to the Vatican in 2019 and I wore my San Lorenzo (jersey), of course,” Rodríguez, 23, said. “I didn’t see him, but I knew he was there with all his energy and healing the world and that’s very significant to me.”\n\nIn a preface the late Pope contributed for an upcoming book by Cardinal Angelo Scola, he left an eloquent message about ageing and dying. “Death is not the end of everything, but the beginning of something,” he wrote.\n\nTalking to those who knew him well, it seems likely he would also have appreciated the warmth and good nature of the desire to see a meaning in his soccer club membership number.\n\nOmar Abboud knew how quick-witted his friend he still knew as Jorge was and how much he enjoyed a joke, but never at anyone else’s expense.\n\n“He has a different kind of humor,” Abboud said of the Pope, “a kind of joke that was with the people, not over the people. He has an intelligent, smart humor.”\n\nAbboud, a prominent Muslim leader in Argentina, formed The Institute of Interreligious Dialogue with then-Cardinal Bergoglio and Rabbi Daniel Goldman in 2002. They visited each other’s communities and regularly held meetings and public exchanges to break down barriers between faith groups.\n\nAbboud said he last visited the Pope in January, when the two spoke of artificial intelligence and how it could be regulated. He said he learned much from his friend Jorge and their discussions about literature and sacred texts. And he’s just beginning to talk about him in the past tense.\n\n“He used to be a good friend, we need him. Really, words are not enough,” he said, his voice trailing off.\n\nFrancis is on the minds of everyone we meet — from his friends to people who admired him from afar, to those to whom he had ministered.\n\nFlowers and messages are left in tribute at his childhood home, a square where he once played kickabout with other kids, and the church where he heard the call from God to join the priesthood. That church, the Basílica de San José de Flores, has an engraving marking the date when Francis received his vocation, while in the confessional — September 21, 1953.\n\nSo many candles have been burned to honor Francis that the steps of the Metropolitan Cathedral are covered with wax.\n\nSeven days of official mourning were declared to honor Francis in Argentina, but they won’t all be filled with sadness.\n\nThe Mass held at San Lorenzo’s chapel ended more as a pep rally and there will be another crowd for the soccer team’s next match on Saturday, a few hours after Francis is laid to rest in Rome.\n\nThe team will wear commemorative jerseys to honor the late pontiff, and there is talk a new stadium will bear the name “Papa Francisco.” In a sign of his humility, Francis once wrote he didn’t much like that idea.\n\nA Swiss Guardsman used to keep Francis updated on match scores and San Lorenzo’s progress by leaving notes on his desk; the Pope has said he had not watched television — barring seismic events like 9/11 — since 1990.\n\nFrancis said his love for sport was not only for the competition — and San Lorenzo is only one of several teams in soccer-mad Buenos Aires, the capital of soccer-mad Argentina, whose men are the current World Cup champions — but for the participation.\n\nHe believed sports, especially team games, get young people away from their screens and shuttered virtual lives and teach them to be out in the world.\n\nThe club may have lost Regular Member 88235 but Buenos Aires will remember him.\n\nA homemade flag at the cathedral linked Francis and San Lorenzo with a simple phrase that seems to apply to Buenos Aires today: “Mis Dos Amores,” my two loves.\n\nFrancis reciprocated that love, writing in his book “Hope:” “My homeland, for which I continue to feel just the same great, profound love.

They have fought three wars over the territory – which is famous for its dramatic mountains and lush meadows – since their independence from Britain in 1947.\n\nA bloody, decades-long insurgency in India’s part of the region has killed tens of thousands, waged by militant groups demanding either independence or a merger with Pakistan.\n\nIndia says those groups are supported by Pakistan, which Islamabad denies.\n\nTuesday’s attack – during which men were singled out and gunned down from close range, according to survivors’ testimony – was the latest in a list of bloody incidents to stain the region.\n\nBalachandran Menonparambil feels as though he’s lost his “right hand,” after his friend of six decades Ramachandran Narayanamenon was killed in the attack.\n\nHaving spent decades working in Qatar, Narayanamenon “looked forward to a life of retirement,” according to his friend, who described him as “a happy man,” caring and reliable.\n\n“He was on a trip with his wife Shiela, daughter Aarti, and two grandchildren and was looking forward to enjoying himself with his grandchildren,” said the 70-year-old.\n\nHe recalled how “excited” Narayanamenon, 69, sounded in their last call before he boarded the flight to Kashmir on Monday.\n\nA day later, Menonparambil was told that his friend was dead.\n\n“I was watching TV and they began to show what was happening in Kashmir… so I called him, but he did not pick up,” he said.\n\nHe then reached out to Narayanamenon’s son Arvind, who told him that “Dad is gone.”\n\nHe said people came up to offer condolences to him at the cremation. “Everybody was asking me what I will do, only half of me is working now. I told them he is there with me in my heart,” he said.\n\nOther survivors speaking to local media said the gunmen accused some of the victims of supporting Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.\n\nIn 2019, Modi’s Hindu-nationalist government stripped Muslim-majority Kashmir of its previous autonomy, sparking protests.\n\nAfter Tuesday’s massacre, New Delhi swiftly pointed the finger at Pakistan, downgrading ties and suspending its participation in a crucial water-sharing treaty. Pakistan has denied involvement and said any attempt to stop or divert water belonging to it would be considered an act of war.\n\nKavita Lele lost her husband Sanjay, 50, and two cousins – Hemant Joshi, 45, and Atul Mone, 43 – in the attack, her brother-in-law Rajesh Kadam told CNN.\n\nAll three men, described as “loving fathers” and family breadwinners, came from just outside the megacity of Mumbai. They had taken the trip to Pahalgam together, according to Kadam.\n\nSanjay and Hemant were both accountants working for small private firms, while Atul worked for the Indian Railways, he said.\n\nFor the Leles, Kadam said, the trip was long planned. His sister-in-law suffers from a form of paralysis on the left side of her body that means she walks with difficulty.\n\n“They had been planning this trip for a while but because of her health issues… it had gotten postponed. Once her health was doing better, they finally all lined up their schedules and managed to go,” he said.\n\n“Lele told his wife that if you won’t go, none of us will go. So she agreed and finally they all went,” said Kadam.\n\nKadam himself did not go on the trip, but later traveled to Kashmir to help bring the shell-shocked survivors from his family back home.\n\nThe holidaying family bought food from a stall not long before the attack. Unaccustomed to the realities of the restive region, they initially mistook the sound of gunfire for fireworks, Kadam said, but were warned to take shelter by locals who sensed danger.\n\nAll three men were shot shortly after, he said. A bullet grazed his 20-year-old nephew Harshal’s hand.\n\nIt took almost four hours for disabled Kavita to struggle down the hill to safety, he said.\n\nHe said the families have taken hope from protests in India demanding justice for the victims and their families.\n\nStill, their lives have been changed forever.\n\n“This is not something that can end,” he said.\n\n“We have to now live with this.”', '', 'Published 4:01 AM EDT, Sat April 26, 2025', 'family-and-friends-shattered-and-scarred-by-tourist-massacre-in-kashmir-1745807748'),

Photos of her face had been taken from social media and edited onto naked bodies, shared with dozens of users in a chat room on the messaging app Telegram.\n\nThe comments in screen shots of the chat room were demeaning and vulgar – as were the texts from the anonymous messenger who had sent her the images. “Isn’t it funny? … Watching your own sex video,” they wrote. “Tell me you honestly enjoy this.”\n\nThe harassment escalated into threats to share the images more widely and taunts that police wouldn’t be able to find the perpetrators. The sender seemed to know her personal details, but she had no way to identify them.\n\n“I was bombarded with all these images that I had never imagined in my life,” said Ruma, who CNN is identifying with a pseudonym for her privacy and safety.\n\nWhile revenge porn – the nonconsensual sharing of sexual images – has been around for nearly as long as the internet, the proliferation of AI tools means that anyone can be targeted by explicit deepfakes, even if they’ve never taken or sent a nude photo.\n\nSouth Korea has had a particularly fraught recent history of digital sex crimes, from hidden cameras in public facilities to Telegram chat rooms where women and girls were coerced and blackmailed into posting demeaning sexual content.\n\nBut deepfake technology is now posing a new threat, and the crisis is particularly acute in schools. Between January and early November last year, more than 900 students, teachers and staff in schools reported that they fell victim to deepfake sex crimes, according to data from the country’s education ministry. Those figures do not include universities, which have also seen a spate of deepfake porn attacks.\n\nIn response, the ministry established an emergency task force. And in September, legislators passed an amendment that made possessing and viewing deepfake porn punishable by up to three years in prison or a fine of up to 30 million won (over $20,000).\n\nCreating and distributing non-consensual deepfake explicit images now has a maximum prison sentence of seven years, up from five.\n\nSouth Korea’s National Police Agency has urged its officers to “take the lead in completely eradicating deepfake sex crimes.”\n\nBut of 964 deepfake-related sex crime cases reported from January to October last year, police made 23 arrests, according to a Seoul National Police statement.\n\nLegislator Kim Nam-hee told CNN that “investigations and punishments have been too passive so far.” So, some victims, like Ruma, are conducting their own investigations.\n\nRuma was a 27-year-old university student when her nightmare first began. When she went to the police, they told her they would request user information from Telegram, but warned the platform was notorious for not sharing such data, she said.\n\nOnce an outgoing student who enjoyed school and an active social life, Ruma said the incident had completely changed her life.\n\n“It broke my whole belief system about the world,” she said. “The fact that they could use such vulgar, rough images to humiliate and violate you to that extreme extent really damages you almost irrevocably.”\n\nShe decided to act after learning that investigations into reports by other students had ended after a few months, with police citing difficulty in identifying suspects.\n\nRuma and fellow students sought help from Won Eun-ji, an activist who gained national fame for exposing South Korea’s largest digital sex crime group on Telegram in 2020.\n\nWon agreed to help, creating a fake Telegram account and posing as a man in his 30s to infiltrate the chat room where the deepfake images had circulated. She spent nearly two years carefully gathering information and engaging other users in conversation, before coordinating with police to help carry out a sting operation.\n\nWhen police confronted the suspect, Won sent him a Telegram message. His phone pinged – he had been caught.\n\nTwo former students from the prestigious Seoul National University (SNU) were arrested last May. The main perpetrator was ultimately sentenced to 9 years in prison for producing and distributing sexually exploitative materials, while an accomplice was sentenced to 3.5 years in prison.\n\nPolice told CNN further investigations identified at least 61 victims, including 12 current and former SNU students. Seoul National University, in a briefing after the incident, said “the school will strengthen preventative education to raise awareness among the members of the university about digital sex crimes and do its best to protect victims and prevent recurrence.”\n\nExcerpts of the ruling shared by Ruma’s lawyers state, “The fake explicit materials produced by the perpetrator are repugnant, and the conversations surrounding them are shocking … They targeted victims as if they were hunting prey, sexually insulted the victims and destroyed their dignity by using photos from graduations, weddings, and family gatherings.”\n\nIn response to the verdict, Ruma told CNN, “I didn’t expect the ruling to align exactly with the prosecution’s request. I’m happy, but this is only the first trial. I don’t feel entirely relieved yet.”\n\nRuma’s case is just one of thousands across South Korea – and some victims had less help from police.\n\nOne high school teacher, Kim, told CNN she first learned she was being targeted for exploitation in July 2023, when a student urgently showed her Twitter screenshots of inappropriate photos taken of her in the classroom, focusing on her body.\n\n“My hands started to shake,” she recalled. “When could this photo have been taken, and who would upload such a thing?”\n\nCNN is identifying Kim by her last name only for her privacy and safety.\n\nBut she said the situation worsened two days later. Her hair was made messy, and her body was altered to make it look like she was looking back. The manipulated picture of her face was added onto nude photos. The sophisticated technology made the images unnervingly realistic.\n\nPolice told her that their only option to identify the poster was to request user information from Twitter, the social media platform bought by Elon Musk in 2022 and rebranded as X in 2023, with an emphasis on free speech and privacy.\n\nKim and a colleague, also a victim of a secret filming, feared that using official channels to identify the user would take too long and launched their own investigation.\n\nThey identified the person: a quiet, introverted student “someone you’d never imagine doing such a thing,” Kim said.\n\nThe person was charged but regardless of what happens in court, she said life will never be the same.\n\nShe said a lack of public empathy has frustrated her too. “I read a lot of articles and comments about deepfakes saying, ‘Why is it a serious crime when it’s not even your real body?’” Kim said.\n\nAccording to X’s current policy, obtaining user information involves obtaining a subpoena, court order, or other valid legal document and submitting a request on law enforcement letterhead via its website.\n\nX says it’s company policy to inform users that a request has been made.\n\nIts rules on authenticity state that users “may not share inauthentic content on X that may deceive people or lead to harm.”\n\nWon, the activist, said that for a long time, sharing and viewing sexual content of women was not considered a serious offense in South Korea.\n\nThough pornography is banned, authorities have long failed to enforce the law or punish offenders, Won said.\n\nSocietal apathy makes it easier for perpetrators to commit digital sex crimes, Won said, including what she called “acquaintance humiliation.”\n\n“Acquaintance humiliation” often begins with perpetrators sharing photos and personal information of women they know on Telegram, offering to create deepfake content or asking others to do so. Victims live in fear as attackers often know their personal information – where they live, work, and even details about their families – posing real threats to their safety and allowing anonymous users to harass women directly.\n\nSince South Korea’s largest digital sex exploitation case on Telegram in 2020, Won said the sexual exploitation ecosystem had fluctuated, shrinking during large-scale police investigations but expanding again once authorities ease off.\n\nThe victims CNN interviewed all pushed for heavier punishment for perpetrators. While prevention is important, “there’s a need to judge these cases properly when they occur,” Kim said.\n\nOnline platforms are also under pressure to act.\n\nTelegram, which has become a fertile space for various digital crimes, announced it would begin sharing user data with authorities as part of a broader crackdown on illegal activities.\n\nThe move came after the company’s CEO Pavel Durov was arrested in August in France on a warrant relating to Telegram’s lack of moderation, marking a turning point for a platform long recognized for its commitment to privacy and encrypted messaging. Durov is under formal investigation but has been allowed to leave France, he said in a post on Telegram.\n\nLast September, South Korea’s media regulator said Telegram had agreed to establish a hotline to help wipe illegal content from the app, and that the company had removed 148 digital sex crime videos as requested by the regulator.\n\nWon welcomed this move, but with some skepticism – saying governments should remove the app from app stores, to prevent new users from signing up, if Telegram doesn’t show substantial progress soon. “This is something that has been delayed for far too long,” she said.\n\nIn a statement to CNN, Telegram said the company “has a zero-tolerance policy for illegal pornography” and uses “a combination of human moderation, AI and machine learning tools and reports from users and trusted organizations to combat illegal pornography and other abuses of the platform.”\n\nA meaningful breakthrough occurred this January, marking the first time Korean authorities successfully obtained crime-related data from Telegram, according to Seoul police.\n\nFourteen people were arrested, including six minors, for allegedly sexually exploiting over 200 victims through Telegram. The criminal ring’s mastermind had allegedly targeted men and women of various ages since 2020, and more than 70 others were under investigation for allegedly creating and sharing deepfake exploitation materials, Seoul police said.\n\nMeanwhile, victims told CNN they hope other women in their position can receive more support from the police and the courts going forward.\n\n“No matter how much punishments are strengthened, there are still far more victims who suffer because their perpetrators have not been caught, and that’s why it feels like the verdict is still far from being a true realization of change or justice,” Ruma said. “There’s a long way to go.”', 'Victims taking action', 'Published 5:00 PM EDT, Fri April 25, 2025', 'deepfakeporn-is-destroying-real-lives-in-south-korea-1745807748');

Most of the 26 people killed are understood to be travelers.\n\nWhile authorities investigate the attack, tensions are rising between India and its neighbor. Despite Pakistan denying that it had any role in the attack, India’s Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri said in a Wednesday press conference that “cross-border linkages of the terrorist act” had been “brought out” during a special meeting of his country’s security cabinet.\n\nAmong the victims was a Nepali national, and another person of “Indian origin who works in the Middle East,” V K Birdi, inspector general of police in Kashmir, told CNN. Misri added that in addition to the Nepali citizen killed, the other 25 victims of the attack were Indian.\n\nBirdi told CNN that the attack took place in a part of the Baisaran Valley – which is only accessible by foot or on horseback. The assault unfolded in a meadow, with mountainous ridges nearby, that stretched several miles without any car roads, he said.\n\nSurvivors described horror as the attack unfolded and a bloody scene wrought by the gunmen.\n\nOne eyewitness told the news agency Press Trust of India that unidentified gunmen opened fire on the tourists from close range.\n\n“My husband was shot in the head while seven others were also injured in the attack,” one woman survivor said, according to PTI.\n\nAnother survivor, Asavari Jagdale, told PTI the gunmen came into the tent where her family was hiding. The attackers accused the family – hailing from India’s western Pune city – of supporting Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, before shooting Jagdale’s male relatives, including her father, she said.\n\nLocal resident Abdul Waheed told CNN he jumped on his pony to help transport the injured back to areas where they could be driven to the hospital, and enlisted others in his local pony association to help. For those who were too injured, they used makeshift cots to carry them down the valley.\n\n“I saw people crying, screaming, just lying in the aftermath of the attack. There were children, women, men, everyone,” he said. “It was a massive trauma. I did not sleep all night.”\n\nA little-known militant group called The Resistance Front claimed responsibility for the attack on social media, voicing discontent at “outsiders” who had settled in the region and caused a “demographic change.” It did not provide evidence, and CNN cannot independently verify its claim.\n\nBirdi told CNN authorities were aware the group had claimed responsibility, but said they were still investigating the matter. As of Wednesday, authorities had carried out medical examinations on the victims, and flown the bodies of the deceased to their home states. Some funerals were held, including that of an Indian Navy Lieutenant who was visiting the destination with his wife.\n\nOn Wednesday evening, police in Kashmir announced a reward of 2 million Indian rupees ($23,433) for “any information leading to the neutralization of the terrorists involved in this cowardly act.”\n\nThe picturesque Himalayan region, administered in part by both India and Pakistan though still disputed by both sides, is often rife with violence and has a heavy security presence – but attacks on tourists are rare.\n\n“It is an implicit sort of contract between the local population and the militant groups that the tourist trade will not be undermined because almost everyone in Kashmir, especially in the Valley, is directly or indirectly dependent on the tourism industry,” said counter-terrorism expert and author Ajai Sahni.\n\nBy Tuesday night, outraged residents had gathered in the region to protest. Videos of the protest show a crowd chanting slogans, holding candles and signs that read: “Stop terrorism.” Other signs called for the resignation of Indian home affairs minister, Amit Shah. Tourists were also scrambling to leave the region, with airlines putting on extra flights.\n\n“Those behind this heinous act will be brought to justice… they will not be spared! Their evil agenda will never succeed,” Indian leader Modi wrote on X.\n\nFollowing the attack, Modi cut short his two-day visit to Saudi Arabia after meeting with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.\n\nIndia’s defense minister Rajnath Singh called the attack “religiously targeted” and “cowardly” on Wednesday, adding that the Indian government will take “appropriate action.”\n\nThe Indian Army corps responsible for military operations in the area of the attack said a search operation was underway to bring “the attackers to justice.” Shah, the home minister, arrived in the region on Tuesday and chaired a high-level security meeting, his office said.\n\nIndia has long accused Pakistan of harboring Islamist militant groups that target Kashmir, something Islamabad denies. Attacks by militants have in the past led to a sharp escalation of tensions between the two nuclear-armed neighbors, both of whom have rival claims to the Himalayan region. India conducted air strikes inside Pakistan in 2019 following an insurgent attack on Indian soldiers.\n\nA spokesperson from Pakistan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs extended condolences to the victims, adding: “We are concerned at the loss of tourists’ lives in an attack in Anantnag district of Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir.”\n\nThe attack came a day after US Vice President JD Vance arrived in India for a visit with his family. On Tuesday, he shared condolences on X, writing: “Over the past few days, we have been overcome with the beauty of this country and its people. Our thoughts and prayers are with them as they mourn this horrific attack.”\n\nUS President Donald Trump also condemned the attack, expressing US solidarity with India against terrorism and calling Modi to convey his condolences, according to Indian authorities.\n\nOther leaders from Russia, Ukraine, Israel, Iran, France, Italy and the UAE also expressed condemnation.\n\nClaimed in its entirety by both India and Pakistan, the mountainous Kashmir region has been at the epicenter of an often-violent territorial struggle between the countries for more than 70 years. The region is one of the world’s most dangerous flashpoints, and a de facto border called the Line of Control divides the areas overseen by New Delhi and Islamabad.\n\nThroughout the past two decades, several domestic militant groups, demanding either independence for Kashmir or for the area to become part of Pakistan, have fought Indian security forces, with tens of thousands of people killed in the violence.\n\nViolence surged in 2018, and the Indian government took greater control of the region in 2019 amid a heavy military presence and a monthslong communications blackout.\n\nWhile the Indian government has said that militancy has since been reduced, attacks continue to plague the region.\n\nOn Tuesday, a regional spokesperson from Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) accused Pakistan of fueling terrorism in the region, and called the attack an “outcome of Pakistan’s frustration.”\n\n“Pakistan and its proxies are unable to digest the return of peace and tourism in Jammu and Kashmir. They want to stifle growth and plunge the region back into fear. But we won’t allow that to happen,” Altaf Thakur said.\n\nPakistan’s defense minister Khawaja Asif denied any link to the attack.\n\n“We have nothing to do with this, and we do not support terrorism anywhere,” he said in a TV interview with a Pakistani news outlet.\n\nPakistan has denied that it had any role in the attack, but India’s foreign secretary announced a number of measures against Islamabad at Wednesday night’s briefing, after Modi chaired a high-level security briefing where “cross border linkages of the terrorist act were brought out,” Misri said.\n\nA significant water-sharing treaty between India and Pakistan will be suspended with immediate effect until Pakistan “credibly and irrevocably” renounces “its support for cross-border terrorism,” the foreign secretary announced.\n\nPakistani nationals in India under the SAARC Visa Exemption Scheme, a scheme that allows professionals, including dignitaries, judges, parliamentarians, and journalists to enter member states visa-free, must now leave the country within 48 hours, he continued.\n\nIn addition, military, naval and air advisors from the Pakistani High Commission in New Delhi must now leave India within the next week, having been declared persona non grata, Misri added. India will also withdraw its military advisors from the Indian High Commission in Islamabad and a key trading check-post between the two nations will be closed, he said.\n\nAfter Misri’s announcement, Pakistani Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar announced that his country’s National Security Committee will meet on Thursday to respond to the measures.\n\nPakistan’s Minister of Energy, Awais Leghari, said in a statement that “India’s reckless suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty is an act of water warfare; a cowardly, illegal move. Every drop is ours by right, and we will defend it with full force — legally, politically, and globally.”\n\nLocal Kashmiris are fearful of a growing anti-Kashmiri and anti-Muslim sentiment brewing on social media and in statements made on national news channels.\n\n“All of Kashmir is in grief and shock, terror has no religion, these haunting images will remain etched in our collective memory, but we are being defamed,” Nasir Khuehami of the Jammu and Kashmir Students Association told CNN Wednesday from Srinagar, the largest city in Jammu and Kashmir.\n\n“Kashmiris have always faced violence and we know what it is like to lose a father or son, we empathize with these families,” he said, adding he has been receiving messages from Kashmiri students across the country who are afraid of being attacked.\n\nSahni, the counter-terrorism expert, said the attack would likely fuel both sides – celebrated as a triumph by Islamist extremists, and feeding fear and Islamophobia among India’s majority Hindu population, thus deepening already-fraught tensions between the two faiths.\n\n“Since this has been an attack specifically on Hindu tourists, so once again it will feed into the communal narrative on both sides,” she added.\n\nPahalgam lies on a major pilgrimage route, known as the Amarnath Yatra, which takes place every year and has been exposed to previous attacks.\n\nThousands of tourists flock to Kashmir during its peak season each year, which runs from March to August.\n\nThe last major attack on tourists in the region took place in June.

Companies were also allowed to swap their androids with substitutes when they could no longer compete, though each substitution came with a 10-minute penalty.\n\nThe first robot across the finish line, Tiangong Ultra – created by the Beijing Humanoid Robot Innovation Center – finished the route in two hours and 40 minutes. That’s nearly two hours short of the human world record of 56:42, held by Ugandan runner Jacob Kiplimo. The winner of the men’s race on Saturday finished in 1 hour and 2 minutes.\n\nAlan Fern, professor of computer sciences, AI and robotics at Oregon State University, told CNN he was “actually very impressed” that the robots managed within the time limit, saying he “would have bet that none of them would finish.”\n\nFern added that there are many companies in China, the US and Europe that are developing their own humanoid robots but says there’s no “clear leader” in the industry at this point.\n\n“And it’s gonna be interesting to see. I’m just excited that there’s so many options at this point in time,” he told CNN’s Kristie Lu Stout.\n\nTang Jian, chief technology officer for the robotics innovation center, said Tiangong Ultra’s performance was aided by long legs and an algorithm allowing it to imitate how humans run a marathon.\n\n“I don’t want to boast but I think no other robotics firms in the West have matched Tiangong’s sporting achievements,” Tang said, according to the Reuters news agency, adding that the robot switched batteries just three times during the race.\n\nThe 1.8-meter robot came across a few challenges during the race, which involved the multiple battery changes. It also needed a helper to run alongside it with his hands hovering around his back, in case of a fall.\n\nMost of the robots required this kind of support, with a few tied to a leash. Some were led by a remote control.\n\nAmateur human contestants running in the other lane had no difficulty keeping up, with the curious among them taking out their phones to capture the robotic encounters as they raced along.', '', 'Updated 1:33 AM EDT, Mon April 21, 2025', 'chinese-robots-ran-against-humans-in-the-worlds-first-humanoid-halfmarathon-they-lost-by-a-mile-1745807748'),

But it’s the Overseas Highway itself — the 113-mile-long engineering marvel under your tires with the ghost of a railway whispering below — that’s allowed motorists to answer the call of the Keys for nearly a century.\n\nThis is no blank-slate stretch of asphalt — the route, leapfrogging from one key to the next over 42 bridges, has seen tragedy and more than its share of colorful characters. Along this part of US 1 from mainland Florida to Key West, you’ll find relics of a historic railroad and plenty of ways to make the most of the aquamarine water all around you.\n\nDriving straight from Miami to Key West can take about four hours if things go smoothly. But if you’re beelining down to Mile Marker 0, you’ll be missing out.\n\n“I think people are learning more about the joy of the other Keys,” said Will Keizer, a captain at Captain Hook’s Marina and Dive Center, which has three locations in the Keys. “If you want bar-to-bar-to-bar busy, Key West is your jam — no doubt about it,” said Keizer, who’s originally from Michigan and has lived in the Florida Keys for about eight years.\n\nBut “if you want to slow down, take in the sights,” he says, it’s time to explore beyond Key West. Here are some stops along the way.\n\nKey Largo — the largest of the Keys and the first destination along the route — immediately delivers the underwater riches that bring divers here in droves.\n\nFor wreck divers, the 510-foot Navy dock landing ship USS Spiegel Grove now serves as an artificial reef six miles offshore. Local dive shops run trips to the wreck, where sea turtles mingle with coral, sponges and cascades of colorful fish. (And for seafood lovers, the pink-orange hogfish fries up nicely at The Fish House).\n\nAlso on Key Largo at Mile Marker 103, John Pennekamp Coral Reef State Park — the first undersea park in the US — offers snorkeling and scuba trips and glass-bottom boat tours.\n\nDown the road another 11 miles in Tavernier, the Blond Giraffe bakes up several delicious variations of the famous key lime pie, made from the zesty little limes that were once grown here commercially.\n\nDrive on and you’ll soon find yourself in Islamorada, a community stretching across five inhabited islands.\n\nJust east of US 1, near Mile Marker 82, a monument to the victims of the 1935 Labor Day Hurricane serves as a reminder of the tragedy that cost hundreds of lives and spurred the creation of the new highway.\n\nAmong the more than 400 dead were hundreds of World War I veterans who were working on a section of the Overseas Highway. Extensive damage from the hurricane put an end to a railroad dating back to 1912, the first direct, over-island route to Key West.\n\n“The state wound up taking over the railroad right of way and essentially made that rail line … a new version of the highway,” said Corey Malcom, lead historian at the Florida Keys History Center in Key West. “And that opened in 1938 and was connected by bridges. And people could then, from 1938 on, drive straight through from the mainland all the way to Key West.”\n\nWhile the Keys’ railroad chapter has long-since closed, reminders of the ambitious project are visible along the route, and its stories are told in exhibits throughout the islands.\n\nThe Over-Sea Railroad was part of the Florida East Coast Railway, owned by Standard Oil partner Henry Flagler. The extension to Key West — inspired by plans for the Panama Canal and its trade possibilities — was dubbed “Flagler’s folly” by skeptics, but the first train reached Key West on January 22, 1912.\n\nAfter the 1935 hurricane hastened the railway’s demise, the railroad bed was used for the new road and some of the railroad bridges were converted for cars — narrow, white-knuckle affairs that live on in memories, in ruins and in a span that’s recently been revived as a pedestrian and biking path.\n\nContinuing south along US 1 in Islamorada, you can’t miss Robbie’s on Lower Matecumbe Key — a one-stop compound for kitschy souvenirs, sport-fishing charters, cold drinks, hot meals and a tarpon feeding frenzy. For $2.50 you can access the dock and another $5 buys a bucket of fish to feed the tarpon. (For a quieter feeding atmosphere, Bud N’ Mary’s, a couple miles before you hit Robbie’s, doesn’t charge admission to its dock.)\n\nSome daredevils will let tarpon, which can grow up to 8 feet long, gulp their hands to the wrist for a great video moment, but Robbie’s visitors on a relatively quiet day in March were dangling fish through holes in a net, seemingly reluctant to participate in any unnerving limb gulping.\n\nAlso in the menagerie was a manatee named Samantha and an aggressive flock of pelicans poised to snatch fish not promptly gobbled up by the tarpon. And policing the dock with a padded stick to maintain order was Ron Hauter, a Robbie’s employee whose right hand showed signs of tangling with the critters.\n\nAt the time, Hauter, who had just moved down from Crystal River, Florida, was two weeks into his dream of living in the Keys.\n\nFlorida native Carl Hiaasen, a novelist and former Miami Herald reporter and columnist, had the same dream growing up in Broward County and lived it for about nine years before he sold his house on Lower Matecumbe Key. But the island chain has served as the backdrop for some of his satirical crime novels, including “Bad Monkey,” which recently became an Apple TV+ series starring Vince Vaughn.\n\n“I’ve set several novels in the Keys because I still find it an intriguing place, not just for the natural beauty, but for the people — the characters — it’s attracting … You have an outlaw component, who’s drawn to the Keys, and you have dreamers, and you have families, and you have retirees and … just retired scoundrels,” Hiaasen said.\n\nTraffic snarls are one reason why Hiaasen ultimately returned to eastern Florida. The Upper Keys can be “a parking lot on the weekends,” he said.\n\nBut for each resident who gets fed up with some of the hassles of Keys life, there’s someone like Ron Hauter ready to give it a shot.\n\n“Everything here is beautiful,” Hauter, 20, said enthusiastically. “The wildlife is so active — and aggressive. Everything is so aggressive in the Keys — I love it.”\n\nRegular traffic can be fierce along Route 1 — and when there’s a wreck? Well, with essentially one road in and one road out, it’s good to have some flexibility.\n\nCase in point: A Monday afternoon accident on the Seven Mile Bridge — the longest and most impressive modern span in the Florida Keys — snarled traffic for hours in early March.\n\nFortunately, the Turtle Hospital, at Mile Marker 48.5, required less than a mile of backtracking, and a planned overnight in Marathon allowed for leisurely waterfront dining instead of hauling down to Key West, feeling hours behind schedule.\n\nThe Turtle Hospital rescues, rehabilitates and, in many cases, releases sea turtles brought in because of boat strikes, disease and other hurdles encountered by the five species found in local waters.\n\nThe 90-minute guided visit involves turtle education, a look at the medical facility and an outdoor tour to see (but not touch) turtles awaiting release as well as others deemed too vulnerable to live in the wild.\n\nMarathon, a community of 13 islands, also offers casual waterside dining where marine wildlife adds to the ambiance.\n\nCastaway features a sushi roll with lionfish — the restaurant’s effort to help rid the Keys of the invasive species. And the manatees jostling in the canal for a sip of cool water dripping from an air-conditioning system keep diners very much in touch with the aquatic environment.\n\nOver on the Gulf side of Marathon, Keys Fisheries offers order-at-the-window seafood, a full bar and waterfront seating with sunset views and glimpses of the sharks, tarpon and pelicans that patrol the marina.\n\nDown the highway, near Mile Marker 47, the old Seven Mile Bridge — nicknamed “Old Seven” — is a prime place to get out and explore on foot.\n\nA 2.2-mile section of the old railway bridge, which was converted for highway traffic in the ‘30s and used until a new bridge was completed in 1982, reopened in 2022 to pedestrians and cyclists.\n\nAt the end of the repurposed section, you can access Pigeon Key, a tiny island where hundreds of railway construction workers lived from 1908 to 1912. Admission is $15 for adults arriving on their own via Old Seven or $28 for those who opt to ride a tourist train from a parking lot a few miles back.\n\nAdmission includes a guided tour, and you can picnic, snorkel and fish while you’re on the island.\n\nThe railway construction workers toiled six days a week, 70 to 80 hours per week for $1.50 per day, according to guide Eric Johnson. There’s a small museum dedicated to their work on the island and several original buildings.\n\nWalking back on the paved pedestrian stretch, with traffic zipping along the wider Seven Mile Bridge nearby, you can see the eras of this route’s history. When the railway was first converted into a highway, the tracks were removed and a 22-foot sheet of steel was laid down and paved. The old train tracks became railings on either side.\n\nThe narrow highway eventually earned the nickname “Highway of Mirrors,” according to Pigeon Key history, because cars passed so close to one another that their side mirrors were knocked off, littering the road.\n\nBack in the car, after crossing over the newer — technically 6.79-mile — Seven Mile Bridge, history buffs will find another impressive railroad ruin: the old steel truss Bahia Honda Bridge.\n\nToday, the area around the bridge at Mile Marker 37 is part of Bahia Honda State Park, where a trail follows the route that was once US 1 up onto the old bridge, where you can walk on one section.\n\nSnorkeling trips run from the park out to Looe Key, a protected reef about 9 miles southwest of the park. Captain Hook’s also runs expeditions to Looe Key.\n\nAt Looe, an hour spent floating above colorful parrotfish, angelfish and barracuda brings time to a near-standstill. Bobbing on the ocean’s surface, the value becomes clear of slowing down, breathing deeply and soaking up the pleasures of the other Keys.\n\nSome 30 miles down the highway, Key West awaits — with its rollicking bars, rooster soundtrack, Jimmy Buffett lore and historic sites tied to Harry S. Truman and Ernest Hemingway. But you should resist the urge to race to Key West straight from the airport in Miami or Fort Lauderdale, says Cori Convertito, a curator and historian at the Key West Art & Historical Society.\n\n“You’re going to get to Key West,” she said. “Hopefully Key West isn’t going anywhere anytime soon — so take your time.”\n\nDelight in the journey.', 'Under the surface', 'Published 8:00 AM EDT, Sat April 26, 2025', 'from-railroad-to-overwater-highway-driving-the-spectacular-route-through-the-florida-keys-1745807748'),

They were each other\'s first love, but lived on opposite sides of Atlantic. Almost three decades later, life brought them back together.', 'When American teenager Kerri Cunningham was dragged by her parents to Europe in the summer of 1993, she was less than impressed.\n\nDragged might sound like dramatic wording, but that’s how 14-year-old Kerri saw it at the time.\n\nKerri reacted to the vacation plans “from the teenage point of view of ‘Oh, it’s taking away from my summer break, and I want to hang out with my friends.’”\n\nLeaving her beachside hometown in the Hamptons, in New York, was the last thing she wanted.\n\n“I was dreading the trip,” Kerri tells CNN Travel today.\n\nLooking back today, Kerri says this was all a bit of a “spoiled brat, teenage attitude.” The trip — embarking first to the UK, then France and culminating in a two-week-bus tour around Italy — was an amazing opportunity.\n\nKerri realizes now that she was fortunate. Her parents wanted their daughters to see the world. But it was hard to see it that way back then. All teenage Kerri could fixate on was the time away from her life in New York.\n\nLittle did Kerri know this voyage to Europe would change her life forever. That she’d still feel the reverberations of this trip three decades on.\n\nThe first few days of the trip were uneventful, at least in Kerri’s mind. She sulked her way across the UK, and boarded a ferry with the other tour participants from Dover, England to Calais, France. She was glad two of her sisters were on the trip too, but she still resented being there.\n\n“And then I saw Dirk,” recalls Kerri. “And it instantly got better.”\n\nAs the ship crossed the English Channel, and the White Cliffs of Dover retreated into the distance, Kerri’s parents got chatting to an English family, the Stevenses, who were also en route to the continent to embark on the Italy bus tour.\n\nDirk was their 15-year-old son. Like Kerri, he was a reluctant teenage tagalong to a family holiday. But then he smiled at Kerri, and everything started to look up.\n\nKerri thought he was “so handsome.”\n\n“I was immediately smitten,” she admits. “Hugh Grant was really big at that time. And he sort of had this young Hugh Grant hair. Being an American girl, Hugh Grant was the guy.”\n\n“A bad haircut,” says Dirk today, laughing. “But it worked at the time.”\n\nDirk tells CNN Travel he also felt an “instant attraction” to Kerri. He vividly remembers his first impression of her: “Beautiful smile, dark hair, really pretty.”\n\nBefore long, the two teens were sitting side-by-side, sharing headphones and listening to Kerri’s Walkman music player.\n\nTheir parents bonded quickly, too.\n\n“We all just got chatting and hit it off,” recalls Dirk. “Our dads are sort of similar guys, you know, like to take machines apart, make something new, build something, design something, have a bonfire…”\n\nAs the group disembarked the ferry in France and boarded the bus to Italy — stopping off here and there en route — the two families grew even closer.\n\n“Our dads would be in a pub somewhere or grabbing a drink, and the moms would be shopping,” recalls Kerri.\n\nTheir parents’ friendship helped cement Kerri and Dirk’s bond, and Kerri also enjoyed observing the way Dirk interacted with his family. Dirk’s dad used a wheelchair, and Dirk was often the family member who’d help his dad navigate the cobbled streets of Italy.\n\n“Here’s this 15-year-old who’s pushing his dad all over Europe in this wheelchair, and not complaining about it, and getting on with it, but doing it with a smile on his face,” Kerri recalls.\n\nShe noticed that Dirk seemed to always “see the bright side of everything.” His warm, breezy attitude won her over.\n\n“I had never met anyone my age who was so comfortable with himself and his family and so accepting of me and mine,” says Kerri. “Everything was just easy and fun. We just got each other and there was a very strong attraction.”\n\nIn the evenings, while the parents were deep in conversation and Kerri’s sisters were doing their own thing, Dirk and Kerri would steal time alone.\n\n“Us two, sneaking off…” recalls Dirk. “There are pictures of us with bottles of champagne we’d taken at dinner.”\n\nThey became “fast friends, which became romantic,” as Dirk puts it. At one of the Italian hotels, they danced together, arm-in-arm. They always sat together at dinners, stealing glances and sharing in-jokes.\n\n“We just felt so comfortable together,” says Dirk. “I remember being on a gondola in Venice and just laughing the entire time.”\n\n“I’m pretty sure we stole a few kisses when our parents weren’t looking,” says Kerri. “I thought he was the cutest boy I had ever met.”\n\nAt the end of the two-week tour, the Cunninghams and the Stevenses promised to stay in touch. There was already talk about getting together the following summer.\n\nStill, for Dirk and Kerri, saying goodbye wasn’t easy. In fact, “it was awful,” says Dirk.\n\n“Just as you find someone special, you have to say goodbye,” he recalls. “But, our parents had already said we’d meet them next summer. Nothing was planned at that point, but everyone was excited for the idea.”\n\nBack in their respective hometowns on opposite sides of the Atlantic, the Cunningham family and the Stevens family remained connected.\n\n“Mum would talk to Mom and we’d be on the phone after,” recalls Dirk. “And Dad with Dad. Soon dates were arranged and the excitement and anticipation builds up.”\n\nA plan was in place: the Stevenses would visit New York in the following summer of 1994, and stay with the Cunninghams at their home on Long Island.\n\nAs they counted down to this reunion, Dirk and Kerri exchanged letters, sending each other magazine clippings and writing dispatches about their lives on opposite sides of the Atlantic.\n\nThey also enjoyed “long phone calls with the old plug-in phones, when you had a really long extension lead so you could go and sit on the stairs or in the bathroom to try and get privacy,” as Dirk recalls.\n\n“My dad was very strict, so I wasn’t allowed to talk to many boys on the phone,” says Kerri.\n\nBut Dirk was an exception.\n\n“Unlike other boys our age, he wasn’t afraid to talk to my parents on the phone,” she says. “In fact, I think he really enjoyed it! And my parents really loved him.”\n\nFor Kerri and Dirk, the 12-month countdown to their reunion only intensified their feelings for each other.\n\n“We’d missed each other for a year, were desperate to see each other,” says Dirk.\n\nKerri remembers the moment she saw Dirk again on Long Island in summer 1994. He smiled at her. Right away, she felt “at home.”\n\nShe loved how he greeted her, calling her “darling.”\n\n“I know it’s an English thing,” says Kerri of the pet name. “But when he called me ‘darling’ — in person, in emails or on the phone — my heart would just melt.”\n\n“It was a very exciting time,” says Dirk of that summer in New York.\n\nKerri and Dirk spent every moment together. They hung out at the beach together, Dirk tagged along to Kerri’s summer job. They spent long evenings in each other’s company.\n\n“This was first-love stuff,” says Dirk. “Knowing that our time together was limited, made it all the more special.”\n\n“We loved each other and were great friends, but we lived an ocean apart and never even considered being together. I guess we thought… ‘How could we?’ We were just teenagers,” says Kerri.\n\nWhen Kerri and Dirk said goodbye at the end of Dirk’s visit, they did so accepting “that we couldn’t be together,” she says.\n\n“But knowing that we’d get to see each other again at some point,” adds Dirk.\n\n“Yeah,” says Kerri. “I kind of felt like, ‘Oh, we’ll always… we’ll always…”\n\n“…Have this,” says Dirk, finishing Kerri’s sentence.\n\nAfter their New York summer, Kerri and Dirk continued to write letters and speak to each other on the phone. But as they finished up high school, this communication gradually slowed down.\n\nCalls became “every two months, then three months…” recalls Dirk.\n\nThen they dropped off almost completely when they graduated. It was still the mid-1990s, and there was no social media offering easy long distance back-and-forth. Staying in touch required time and effort.\n\n“We both got busy. We loved each other, but we weren’t sure when we’d get to see each other again,” says Dirk. “We were both students that couldn’t afford expensive flights. Life gets in the way.”\n\n“We were both going to college, working, dating and our lives were moving ahead,” says Kerri. “We were so far apart, being together just didn’t seem possible.”\n\nStill, even when they weren’t in touch, the two always thought of each other fondly. Plus, their parents remained connected, so Kerri and Dirk got regular secondhand updates on each other.\n\n“Mum would pass me on information about Kerri and the family,” recalls Dirk. “We’d catch each other every now and then.”\n\nAs email became more commonplace, Kerri and Dirk would send the occasional note back and forth. They’d write, as Dirk recalls it, “how you doing? Thought of you today. Miss you.”\n\n“Emails were easier than phone calls,” he says.\n\nThen, in Kerri’s first year of college, her father was diagnosed with ALS, a progressive neurodegenerative disease. When she was 19, he passed away.\n\nIt was a devastating loss for Kerri and the Cunningham family. The Stevenses were also heartbroken to hear the news.\n\nAround the time of her father’s death, Kerri had been supposed to go to Paris with some girlfriends. The trip got called off.\n\nThrough the grapevine, Dirk’s mother heard about Kerri’s canceled vacation. She immediately offered a suggestion to Kerri’s mother: she’d love to take Kerri and Dirk to Paris, together. Dirk’s mother had studied there when she was younger, and knew the city well. It was the least she could do, she said, after the loss they’d weathered.\n\nLooking back today, Kerri suggests that Dirk’s mother was also keen for Dirk to reconnect with Kerri.\n\n“She knew how much we cared for each other and I think she wanted us to be together as much as we wanted it,” says Kerri.\n\nKerri’s mother encouraged her daughter to go. Soon, Kerri started daydreaming about Paris again. Flights were booked and hotels arranged — and Kerri and Dirk got back in regular touch. Via email, they started counting down the days until their reunion.\n\n“All that excitement built up again,” says Dirk.\n\nKerri hoped seeing Dirk would be a balm to her grief. And when he picked her up from the airport in February 2001, she was proven right.\n\nIt was like they’d never been apart, though it had been seven years since they’d last seen each other in person. They were now in their early 20s.\n\n“We were different, we’d grown up a bit,” says Dirk. “Kerri was more beautiful.”\n\n“It happened to be Valentine’s Day week,” says Kerri. “It was very romantic.”\n\nWith Dirk’s mother leading the way, Kerri and Dirk visited Notre Dame, took walks on the Seine, climbed the Eiffel Tower, visited the Moulin Rouge and toured the Louvre. They also went off the tourist track.\n\n“Mum had studied Art History and languages there, so she took us to see unusual buildings, unique architecture, cafes she remembered…” says Dirk.\n\nEverywhere in Paris felt suffused with romance. The Eiffel Tower was emblazoned with a big red heart. All the restaurants had roses on the table centerpiece.\n\n“Everywhere we went Dirk would say ‘Do you like that? I ordered it special, just for you.’ And his mom and I would laugh,” says Kerri.\n\nBut it really did feel, recalls Kerri, like “everything in Paris that week was for us.”\n\n“It was magical,” she says. “After his mom would go to bed, we’d go out and find a little bar where we would have drinks and dance and share our fears and our dreams. It was so lovely and I didn’t want it to end.”\n\nThe trip was perfect, but it also felt bittersweet. Kerri was grieving her father. Some part of her also saw Paris as a farewell to her teenage love for Dirk.\n\nAs an adult, she felt the barriers of ever being together even more acutely.\n\n“It just seemed impossible,” she says.\n\nDirk and Kerri were now in their early twenties, tied to their respective home countries through jobs, friends and commitments.\n\nThey said farewell at the end of the week with no plans to see one another again.\n\n“We knew we’d keep in touch and fate would do its thing,” says Dirk. “It’s always a tough goodbye, with hugs, tears and kisses.”\n\n“I guess it always felt like a ‘vacation romance’ and we told ourselves that’s all it was to avoid getting hurt,” says Kerri.\n\nAfter Paris, Kerri went back to New York and Dirk returned to the UK. As they moved through their twenties, Kerri and Dirk both made life choices that cemented them on different paths.\n\n“I had different girlfriends, and ended up having a baby and later getting married and having three children,” says Dirk.\n\nMeanwhile, Kerri met and fell in love with a fellow Long Islander, Dean.\n\nThe Cunningham family and the Stevens family remained in touch. Kerri’s mother went to Dirk’s sister’s wedding in the UK. Dirk’s parents visited Kerri’s mother in New York. And Dirk’s parents attended Kerri’s wedding to Dean, in the summer of 2010.\n\n“All the families were still connected and loved each other,” says Dirk.\n\nThrough their families, Kerri and Dirk learned updates about one another, and how they were navigating life’s ups and downs.\n\nIn 2015, Dirk’s daughter was diagnosed with a rare genetic neurological and developmental disorder. Then in 2016, his mother died suddenly.\n\nAnd that same year, Kerri’s husband Dean was diagnosed with a terminal Glioblastoma brain tumor.\n\nDirk reached out to Kerri after hearing the news, offering his support from afar.\n\nBut Kerri was swept up in hospital appointments, caring for her husband and processing the inevitable loss that was to come.\n\n“It was 20 years after my dad…it just felt like ‘This is happening again,’” recalls Kerri. “I remember looking at my mom and my sister and just saying, ‘I can’t do this.’ But you do it, you find the strength and you do it.”\n\nEighteen months after his cancer diagnosis, Dean passed away.\n\n“I lost him in 2017,” says Kerri. “We did not have any children.”\n\nIn the aftermath of Dean’s passing, Kerri says her “world turned upside down.” She didn’t know how to process the loss or what to do next.\n\nA couple of years passed in a blur. Kerri fell into a relationship that didn’t feel right. She agonized over the future.\n\n“Then my aunt suggested a trip to Ireland with her to ‘get away,’” says Kerri. “Around the same time, Dirk emailed me to see how I was doing. I told him of my upcoming plans for Ireland and he asked if he and his dad could meet us there. We hadn’t seen each other in 17 years.”\n\nKerri was surprised when Dirk suggested joining her in Dublin. She said Dirk and his father were welcome to come along, but internally, she doubted they would. Kerri knew Dirk was married, with three children in the picture. She thought it was unlikely that he would board a flight to Dublin to see old family friends out of the blue.\n\nBut unbeknownst to Kerri, Dirk was separated from his wife. The couple had gone through a tough time and were in the process of getting divorced. Dirk had moved in with his father.\n\nDirk didn’t mention any of this to Kerri in his emails. He didn’t want to seem like he was trying to overshadow Kerri’s loss. And he didn’t have any specific intentions when he got back in touch. He’d just been trying to reconnect with old friends in the wake of his marriage breaking down. He knew his father would enjoy seeing Kerri, and it was easy for them to get to Ireland from their home in England.\n\nUntil the moment Kerri and Dirk reunited in Dublin, she didn’t believe he’d come.\n\nBut then, suddenly, he was in front of her. Standing there, in person, for the first time in almost two decades.\n\n“When we saw each other, we hugged so tightly and I started crying. I realized I had never stopped loving him and, boy, was it nice to be hugged by such an old, true friend,” recalls Kerri.\n\nShe surprised herself by feeling the same sentiment she’d felt when she reunited with Dirk on Long Island, in the summer of 1994: “It felt like I was home.”\n\nDirk felt this same feeling when he saw Kerri: a surprising certainty that everything was right with the world, despite everything they’d been through while they were apart.\n\nThe two spent the rest of the day in Dublin together, with Dirk’s father and Kerri’s aunt completing the party. They toured the Guinness Factory and went out for dinner as a group.\n\nAnd as Dirk pushed his father’s wheelchair through the Dublin streets, Kerri’s aunt walked alongside, Kerri had a feeling of déjà vu. It felt like the summer they’d first met, touring Europe in 1993, “like we were teenagers again. Just exploring a city with our chaperones.”\n\nThey were only together for a couple of days, but during this time, Kerri and Dirk opened up to each other. She told Dirk about her unhappiness and uncertainty amid her grief. He told her about his marriage breakdown.\n\n“As old friends do, we talked — about all the good and bad going on in our lives — and the truth came out,” says Kerri. “It felt like some divine intervention that we were there for each other.”\n\n“That holiday, the time we spent, was just perfect, and it was just what we both needed, unknowingly, perhaps,” says Dirk.\n\nIt helped that their long history led to an easy comfort, even after years apart. They felt able to be totally honest with each other.\n\n“It was very freeing to just be with someone that you trust and spill your guts to them,” says Kerri.\n\nPerhaps it was Kerri and Dirk’s ease with one another that explained why, everywhere they went, strangers assumed they were a couple.\n\n“In a pub, just having a conversation in a queue…they’re like, ‘Oh my God. How long have you two been together? You’re the nicest couple we’ve ever met,’” recalls Dirk. “And we’re like, ‘No, we’re not. We’re old friends, and we just came with my dad and her aunt.’”\n\nThe two laughed off strangers’ assumptions, but both wondered if there was something in them.\n\nAs they readied themselves to say goodbye, both Kerri and Dirk hoped this wouldn’t be goodbye forever.\n\nAnd then, before Kerri left for the airport, Dirk decided to take a chance: he told Kerri he loved her.\n\n“Maybe we can make this work?” he asked her.\n\nFor Kerri, this was the decisive moment. It was scary and unknown, but she felt she should take a leap of faith into a life with Dirk. She knew she loved him too.\n\n“I knew I had to give us a real chance, because something much bigger had brought us back together,” she says today.\n\nThe leap of faith paid off. Today, six years since they reunited in Ireland, Kerri and Dirk are a couple, now in their forties, living life together, as a team.\n\nKerri’s job still ties her to the US, while Dirk’s kids live with him fulltime, so he’s in the UK.\n\nBut the couple make the back and forth work. Kerri splits her time across the Atlantic, and loves spending time with Dirk’s children. She says getting to know them has been “a real gift.”\n\nIn the six years since they reunited, Kerri and Dirk have helped each other rebuild their lives, embrace the present and embark on a new future together.\n\n“Needless to say, both of our families were over the moon,” adds Kerri.\n\nDirk’s father recently passed away, but before he died, he told Kerri she was the best thing that happened to his son.\n\nKerri’s mother, who is in her eighties, is also very supportive. When Kerri told her she’d reunited with Dirk, Kerri’s mother told her their love story was “written in the stars.”\n\n“While she doesn’t love me being so far away most of the year, she knows that I am where I’m meant to be,” says Kerri.\n\nWhile Kerri and Dirk wish that her father and his mother had also lived to see them finally get together, Kerri believes they know. She feels their presence, their influence in her life, all the time.\n\n“We have lots of angels that look over us,” Kerri says, referring to all the loved ones she and Dirk have lost, including her late husband, Dean, who she’ll always hold close to her heart.\n\n“Dean and I, we traveled all around the world, and we did fun stuff, and he lived an amazing life as well. I’m forever grateful for those years,” Kerri says, reflecting that “Dean would be very happy” to see where she is today.\n\nNavigating the loss of her late husband also helped Kerri have the courage to embrace her new chapter with Dirk.\n\nWhile she always felt safe and comfortable with Dirk, she knew any relationship comes with risk, with its challenges and uncertainties.\n\n“But after Dean died, I said, ‘I’m not afraid of anything, because I feel like I’ve been through the worst thing possible,’” recalls Kerri. “If this doesn’t work, then it doesn’t work.”\n\nAnd when Dirk makes her laugh and makes her smile, Kerri embraces that happiness wholeheartedly and gratefully, not taking any of it for granted.\n\n“We always have fun,” Kerri says of her life with Dirk. “You can’t be sad forever. Life goes on, and I think everybody deserves to be happy…and the hard times are always the hardest when you’re in them and you realize how strong you know we all are. We’re all a lot stronger than we think we are.”\n\nTogether, Kerri and Dirk’s attitude to life is to “accept and enjoy the journey,” as Dirk puts it.\n\n“Enjoy the journey,” echoes Kerri. “That’s how we started. We started out on a journey. And we met each other.”\n\n“And now we’re just continuing the journey,” says Dirk. “Let the universe take you along. You know, it will guide you where you’re meant to go.”\n\nKerri adds — jokingly — that the moral of their story is “go on a trip with your parents when you’re a teenager, even if you don’t want to.”\n\nBut more seriously, Kerri suggests it’s “allow yourself to be happy, and to be open to the universe.”\n\n“We were always meant to be together,” she says of Dirk. “We are twin flames that found our way back to each other after all those years.”', 'A significant meeting', 'Published 9:08 AM EDT, Fri April 25, 2025', 'they-had-a-teen-summer-romance-26-years-later-they-reunited-1745807748'),

Christy, meanwhile, was being covertly investigated in 2007 over the theft of several artworks, including a 17th-century etching by Dutch master Rembrandt van Rijn.\n\n“That etching that was my entrée into his ring,” recalled Walker, who recently retired from the FBI after almost 29 years, allowing him to speak more openly about his career exposing fraudsters, forgers and traffickers in elaborate sting operations.\n\n“At the time, I was really hyper-focused on learning about fine art prints,” added the former agent, who met Christy through a confidential source in 2007. “And I made him believe I was the kind of person who could sell a Rembrandt.”\n\nBut things got trickier for Walker, he said, when Christy’s expert accomplice got in touch.\n\n“(Christy) took art off walls, but he wouldn’t necessarily know if it was valuable or not. He would figure that out later on,” Walker told CNN over Zoom. “So, starting off that operation, I was the expert — I knew more than him. But, pretty quickly, the tables turned… the stakes got pretty intense once I found myself going head-to-head with an art dealer.”\n\nAround 18 months earlier, Walker said, Christy had unexpectedly vanished from the FBI’s radar. It transpired he was serving time, for an unrelated theft, at Washington State Corrections Center, court records show. By happenstance, Christy had shared a cell with Kurt Lidtke, a disgraced art dealer whom the FBI said was imprisoned for selling his clients’ works without paying them proceeds. Using the latter’s knowledge of the Seattle art market — namely the whereabouts of some of its most valuable paintings — the two cellmates began plotting an ambitious crime spree, Walker said.\n\n“They were going to hit dozens of collections in the Pacific Northwest to the tune of several hundred million dollars,” he added.\n\nWalker, still masquerading as an art dealer, resumed contact with Christy upon his release from prison. Christy soon carried out a successful burglary, while Lidtke was still in prison, according to court documents. And it wasn’t long before his new co-conspirator called Walker to sell him some paintings — and to sound him out, the former investigator said.\n\n“Fortunately, (Lidtke) thought I was a dealer who specialized primarily in California Impressionists, and he was a dealer who specialized in the Northwest School (a 20th-century art movement),” said Walker, adding that they later “spent a lot of time talking about our respective areas of expertise.”\n\nWalker used his art market knowledge to build rapport with the dealer, he said, and gained the duo’s trust by pretending to sell three of their stolen artworks. He also began gathering information about their next potential victim as the FBI prepared a trap at the target’s home.\n\nEven as authorities appeared to be closing in — Christy was confronted by police while surveilling the property from a parked pickup truck, though he was allowed to leave the scene — Walker believes his performance had been so convincing that Lidtke was oblivious to his involvement until the very end, attributing Christy’s brief encounter with police on bad luck.\n\n“Kurt (Lidtke) didn’t trust his instincts and blame me,” he recalled. “We’d had a long enough, and a solid enough, relationship up to that point that he didn’t listen to that inner voice saying, ‘Well, if only three people in the world knew (about the planned robbery) it must have been (him)’.”\n\nThe FBI averted the burglary and later arrested the pair, according to court documents. Walker said that incriminating recordings he collected during the sting operation helped secure convictions for both Lidtke and Christy, on charges of conspiracy and transportation of stolen goods. In 2011, they were sentenced to four and five-and-a quarter years in prison, respectively.\n\nThe Art Crime Team, and Walker’s involvement with it, dates to the early years of the Iraq War.\n\nAs US troops advanced on Baghdad following the 2003 invasion, looters had plundered an estimated 15,000 artifacts from the country’s National Museum in just 36 hours. At the time, Walker, who had been an FBI agent since 1996, expressed willingness to investigate the thefts. Despite studying business administration and accounting at college, he gravitated toward art history courses and was interested in cases involving cultural heritage.\n\n“I called (FBI) headquarters and said, ‘Hey, if you send a team to Iraq, put me in coach,” he recalled.\n\nUltimately, the FBI did not send him, or any agents, to Baghdad in 2003. But amid widespread criticism of America’s failure to protect Iraq’s cultural property — and realizing a need for experts to track down the items, or to be deployed overseas in future looting incidents — the bureau established a specialist art team the following year.\n\nThanks to his earlier interest and internal reputation for sophisticated undercover operations, Walker was recruited to the unit. He was one of fewer than 10 founding agents who would be trained in the history, vocabulary and, most importantly, business of art. “Within the first year of being on the team, I started taking more advanced level college courses that helped inform my approach to these operations,” Walker recalled.\n\nThe team was focused not only on thefts, from homes, galleries or archeological sites, but also forgery and trafficking rings. Given how many stolen artworks end up on the US market, it also investigated art crimes committed overseas. Today, the unit has more than doubled in size and employs experts in fields including archaeology and anthropology, as well as former art market professionals.\n\nSince its founding in 2004, the Art Crime Team has recovered more than 20,000 items of cultural property, including thousands of items from the National Museum of Iraq (though the FBI estimates that between 7,000 and 10,000 of those remain unaccounted for). This two-decade haul is valued at over $1 billion, which Walker called “an oversized return on investment” for the FBI. And that figure doesn’t include the potential value of seized fakes that could have generated billions of dollars if successfully sold. One of the former agent’s last cases involved a dealer with “about $2 billion in inventory — that was all fake,” he said.\n\nRecent successes speak to the unit’s broad remit. Last year alone, its investigations led to the return of a Revolutionary War-era musket to a Philadelphia museum; the recovery of a pocket watch once owned by Theodore Roosevelt that had been missing since the 1980s; and the repatriation, to Japan, of 22 artifacts looted following the Battle of Okinawa in 1945. One of the team’s most high-profile cases involved a pair of ruby slippers, worn by Judy Garland as Dorothy in “The Wizard of Oz,” that were recovered 13 years after being stolen from a museum in Minnesota.\n\nFor the latter operation, Walker posed as a Hollywood memorabilia authenticator to help lure in a suspect seeking the $1 million reward for the objects’ return, he said. To prepare, he spent time with experts at the Smithsonian’s National Museum of American History (which owns another pair of Garland’s set-worn ruby slippers), to study exactly how they would examine the objects.\n\nBut while there are undercover agents who can be “anything, at any time, in any place,” Walker said, he is not of that mold, despite sometimes running up to five covert operations at a time. For him, it’s all about a level of preparation — sometimes over-preparation — akin to method acting.\n\n“It was understanding what that role should look like, and doing my best to understand that persona,” he said. “But at the end of the day, when you’re in role, the best thing to do is just be yourself. It’s easier to lie when you’re telling the truth.”\n\nIn other words: The more he knew, the more convincing he could be. “I had a lot of cases that involved Warhol, whether thefts or fakes,” Walker offered as an example. “Studying Warhol, and getting a deeper knowledge of his materials, his processes and his compositions helped me in a lot of the undercover operations.”\n\nWalker’s performances also relied on “verbal or visual” cues typical of the professionals he was impersonating. He would sometimes dress the part, too, by wearing the expensive clothes of a high-end dealer or dressing down as the kind of uber-wealthy collector who “has so much money he doesn’t need to care about appearances,” the former agent said.\n\nHe would wear a pair of lucky Bob Ross socks, too. It was, after all, dangerous work.\n\n“There were a few moments where I thought to myself, ‘Oh, this is how it ends,’” he recounted in a subsequent email exchange with CNN, adding: “Every single undercover meeting has the potential to escalate, even when dealing with individuals that don’t have a history of violence. In fact, I think those individuals that have no prior convictions can be more dangerous. They tend to have the most to lose.”\n\nCases come to the Art Crime Team in various ways. Local police may alert the FBI to thefts if the stolen goods cross (or are thought to have crossed) state lines. The bureau also invites the public to provide anonymous tip-offs via its National Stolen Art File, a database containing thousands of missing paintings, sculptures and artifacts with cultural value, from candelabras to ceramics.\n\nUsually, however, missing art only comes to the authorities’ attention when it enters, or re-enters, the market.\n\n“Stealing the artwork is usually the easy part,” Walker said. “It’s selling the artwork that’s the hard part (because) there aren’t too many people in the world — and certainly no reputable art dealers — who want to buy stolen art. Often, the thieves haven’t really thought through how they’re going to sell the artworks.”\n\nThe FBI’s running list of “top 10 art crimes” features various high-profile items that would now be near-impossible to move on the open market. There’s the $3 million Stradivarius violin stolen from a New York City apartment in 1995, and the Pierre-Auguste Renoir painting taken in an armed robbery from a Houston home in 2011. Then there is, in Walker’s view, the holy grail of art crime: The 13 works, including paintings by Rembrandt, Édouard Manet and Edgar Degas, snatched from Boston’s Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in a notorious 1990 heist.\n\n“If you said you had a lead on them tomorrow, in any part of the world, the team would throw every resource they could at (it),” he said of the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum artworks. You might also, he added, end up $10 million richer thanks to the reward offered up by the museum’s board.\n\nArt criminals’ motivations are almost always financial, Walker said. Their downfall often shares a common theme, too, whether it’s trusting an undercover agent or seeking big-money rewards for stolen goods: greed. And while the former agent didn’t see a significant increase in art-related crimes over his two decades investigating them (if there appear to be more media reports, it’s because “we just got better at doing our job”), he believes perpetrators’ scope and abilities grew in that time.\n\n“Twenty years ago, largely, fraud was more of the household names and the dead guys. It was the Rothkos or the Picassos. But now it’s living contemporary artists that are being faked in their lifetime,” he said, adding that technology now allows forgers to operate without conventional artistic skills. “There are printing technologies that can mimic brushstrokes. So, with a small investment and a really good high-resolution camera, you can create fakes today that rival the quality of a (master forger).”\n\nThe threat posed to living artists is now Walker’s main preoccupation. After retiring from the FBI in December, he founded the Art Legacy Institute (ALI), a non-profit helping artists protect their work and livelihoods from fraud. Having spent a career solving crimes, he now hopes to prevent them from happening in the first place.\n\nForgeries come in two guises: either a known work is replicated, or a new composition is created in the artist’s style and positioned as a previously undocumented work. According to Walker, the solution — to the latter, at least — is surprisingly simple: cataloging. ALI is creating a detailed digital archive, stored on its server, that he hopes would become the definitive record of an artist’s output.\n\n“Documenting what you create, as an artist, is the most important thing you can do… There’s been no shortage of artists who grind away for (decades) to finally get recognized for their contribution, for demand to increase, and then all of a sudden, the fraudsters come out,” he said. “They start attacking the style the artists were doing 20 or 30 years earlier that is not well documented — and it’s those gaps (in provenance) that allow the fraudsters to thrive.”\n\nAs for identifying like-for-like replicas? That’s where technology now comes in. Last month, Walker’s organization announced a partnership with optical AI firm Alitheon that can create a unique “digital fingerprint” for any artwork — thousands of data points recording miniscule surface details, invisible to even the greatest forger’s eye.\n\n“It is simple to use and scalable, and it just works,” Walker said, joking: “Even an old, retired FBI agent can use this tech.”', '‘It’s easier to lie when you’re telling the truth’', 'Published 6:00 AM EDT, Sun April 27, 2025', 'forgers-and-fraudsters-trusted-him-for-decades-but-he-was-an-undercover-fbi-art-detective-1745807748'),

They were also made available online, where they quickly sold out.\n\nThe brainchild of Hong Kong-born, Netherlands-raised illustrator Kasing Lung, Labubu and fellow creatures from his “The Monsters” series have amassed a loyal following since their founding in 2015. But Labubu’s popularity has spiked over the past year, thanks to celebrity endorsements. Lisa, from K-pop mega group Blackpink, has frequently professed her love of the creature on social media. “Labubu is my baby,” she said in a recent Teen Vogue video.\n\nTitled “Big Into Energy,” the latest drop features six vinyl plush pendants (and one “secret” figurine) representing “emotions” like love, hope and happiness — each made in new colorways.\n\nThe new Labubus cost between $13 and $16 each in various Asian countries. Shortly after their release on Friday, some pendants were being resold for up to $90 on US online resell platform StockX.\n\nAt the CentralWorld shopping mall in Bangkok, dozens of fans lined up before its branch of Pop Mart — Labubu’s licensed distributor — had even opened, despite having pre-registered time slots.\n\nUniversity student Kamolwan Pohfah, 21, said she left home early to reach the store because she couldn’t wait to get her hands on the newest collection. “I have been following Labubu for almost two years now,” she told CNN.\n\n“It was kind of ugly at first sight. But I kept seeing it on social media. And my friends are crazy about it, so I follow them,” she said.\n\nTourist Emily Jong, 27, who was also in line and visiting from Australia, said she tried her luck at the mall hours before she was due to fly home, but left empty-handed. “We tried to line up but we didn’t know we have to register,” she said.\n\nHathairus Mekborisut, 53, bought a box set of six pendants. She decided to keep one, named “luck,” for herself and to resell the rest. She’s been “longing” for a purple one, she said.\n\nAnother reseller who goes by her nickname Mai, and wanted to remain anonymous, led a small group to buy up as many as possible. She said she could make double the retail price by reselling them to customers in other countries.\n\nDespite recently shooting to global fame, Labubu (who is a girl) has been a decade in the making. She first appeared as a side character, often hiding in the background, in a fairy world created by Lung in his three-part picture book series, “The Monsters,” according to Pop Mart, the Chinese toy company licensed to sell Labubu merchandise.\n\nBoasting rabbit-like ears, big round eyes and a mischievous grin, Labubu is “kind-hearted and always wants to help, but often accidentally achieves the opposite,” the company said on its website.\n\nLung, 52, previously told Hong Kong local newspaper Ming Pao that the character was inspired by his childhood, which was filled with Nordic folk tales of elves, trolls and fairies. After moving to the Netherlands as a child, he picked up Dutch through simple picture books.\n\nFans often accessorize their outfits by clipping Labubu plushies onto their clothes or bags (they were even spotted at Paris Fashion Week last month). The figurines are also taken to fan-led meet-ups or posted on online marketplaces, where they are traded and resold.\n\nPop Mart, a Chinese toymaker that has made its mark in a collectibles market traditionally dominated by Japan, has found success in selling Labubus in a blind-box format — which makes contents a mystery until opened, adding to their appeal. “The Monsters” series is its best-selling franchise, and last year generated 3 billion yuan ($410 million) in sales.\n\nVideos of young fans anxiously unboxing the figurines, and erupting into joy — or sometimes disappointment — have flooded social media platforms like TikTok. And celebrities like Rihanna and Blackpink’s Rosé have only added to the hype.\n\nOn Wednesday, Blackpink’s Lisa showed off her new pink and yellow tie-dye furry Labubu, from the latest release, in an Instagram story. She revealed herself as a fan about a year ago, when a photo of the star hugging a large Labubu in a camping costume went viral. Her endorsement is widely credited with fueling the toy’s popularity, particularly in Southeast Asia, which is Pop Mart’s largest — and fastest growing — overseas market. Last year, the Chinese toymaker’s annual revenues in the region grew by 619% to over 2.4 billion yuan ($309 million).\n\nA fan base is also growing in the US, though American buyers will have to pay more for their purchases amid a trade war between China and the US, which has hit most Chinese imports with a 145% tariff. (China retaliated with a 125% tariff.) A blind box from the latest series, which also went on sale in the US on Friday, is priced at $27.99, up from $21.99 for the previous series.\n\nAmong the new Labubus being released is a rare one labeled “Secret,” which buyers have just a 1-in-72- chance of unboxing.\n\n“It’s quite fun. If you do get the secret ones, you do get the dopamine,” said 27-year-old collector Lawrence Yu, who lives in Melbourne, Australia and has so far spent $1,200 Australian dollars ($763) on over two dozen Labubus, ranging from ones found in “blind boxes” to plush toys.\n\nHe recalled arriving ahead of a drop at a local mall, where a new Pop Mart store had opened last October, at 2:30 a.m, before spending 10 hours in line.\n\n“I hope it comes to Melbourne soon,” he said in a video call, referring to the new series, which will not be released in physical stores in Australia until the end of this month.', '', 'Published 6:10 AM EDT, Fri April 25, 2025', 'labubu-the-kind-of-ugly-plush-toy-that-has-taken-the-world-by-storm-1745807748');

On Thursday, the fashion brand presented its first, in Barcelona.', 'Few fashion designers are synonymous with weddings like Vivienne Westwood, whose revolutionary approach — in fashion as well as in life — was fired by her disdain for corruption and injustice, earning her nicknames such as the “high priestess of punk.”\n\nIt’s an ethos that may seem at odds with the conspicuous consumption that the bridal industry is associated with. But Westwood, who died in 2022, was also one of the UK’s most revered style icons, and the designs by the British house she founded in 1971 have long appeared on many a bridal Pinterest board.\n\nThrough the adept use of draping, corsetry and other details that transform the wearer, Vivienne Westwood’s designs are flattering on the figure. What sets it apart from other labels is its signature punk and subversive aesthetics, consequently appealing to brides who crave something different and unique and want to express their individuality.\n\nSinger Miley Cyrus, burlesque dancer and model Dita von Teese and chef and former model Lorraine Pascale are among the celebrities who have worn a Westwood gown for their wedding day. Even WikiLeaks founder and activist Julian Assange and his wife were outfitted by the designer for their wedding, which took place in the high-security Belmarsh prison in London. (Westwood herself was a longtime supporter of Assange and called for his release from custody.)\n\n“People are drawn to Vivienne Westwood because she stands for something,” the brand’s creative director Andreas Kronthaler, and also the late designer’s husband, wrote to CNN in an email. “She stands for women, and for strength, power and courage.” He added: “The Vivienne Westwood bride is a heroine.”\n\nYet, while several brides wearing Vivienne Westwood have been featured in magazines, including Vogue and Elle, perhaps the most memorable example is Carrie Bradshaw (played by Sarah Jessica Parker), who wore a voluminous gown by the label when she was left stilted at the altar in the 2008 “Sex and the City” movie — leading to a dramatic scene in the middle of Manhattan, where she chides her fiancé, Mr. Big, for the humiliation.\n\nOne might imagine that to be the last of Bradshaw’s famous dress — but in an unexpected move, it was revived in the second season of series’ reboot “And Just Like That,” when she sought a last-minute look to wear to what it called the “Met Ball.” She gave the dress an update by accessorizing her look with a matching teal cape, gloves and heels. (The television series and sequel aired on HBO, which shares the same parent company as CNN: Warner Bros. Discovery.)\n\nHoping to capitalize on its renown, Vivienne Westwood staged its first bridal fashion show as part of Barcelona Bridal Fashion Week on Thursday.\n\nStaged at the University of Barcelona and attended by local celebrities including Spanish singer Bad Gyal and Spanish actor Georgina Amorós, 35 new looks — including made-to-order and couture designs — were presented. In true Westwood fashion, these were no ordinary wedding gowns. Several looks veered away from tradition and were not a typical bridal white. There were also shirts, blazers and trousers.\n\n“The collection is a potpourri of past, present and future,” Kronthaler explained. “It’s what we are about. It’s the spirit of the house.”\n\nThe first time that a wedding dress by Vivienne Westwood appeared on the runway was during her Spring-Summer 1992 show, though her history with bridalwear dates back to 1962, when she designed her own wedding dress for her first marriage to Derek Westwood. (They separated in 1965.)\n\nWestwood met Kronthaler in 1988, when she was teaching fashion design at the Vienna School of Applied Art, and when the two wed in 1993, she also designed their wedding looks: identical light grey wool suits with butter-yellow cotton polos.\n\nKronthaler declined to comment on the current size of Vivienne Westwood’s bridal business but said that it was “an important part of the house” as “something Vivienne and I have done since the early 90s.” He continued: “It’s grown over the years, and we’ve cultivated a desire for it, because we offer something particular and special.”\n\nOriginally available as a bespoke service for private clients, Vivienne Westwood’s bridal offering has expanded since 2019 to include made-to-order collections that are sold in its five bridal salons in London, Paris, Milan, New York and Los Angeles. Its ready-to-wear bridal designs are also stocked by retailers globally: On Mytheresa, a mini dress made from crêpe satin costs $4,790, while a full-length gown is priced at $14,350.\n\nToday, Vivienne Westwood competes with a wider spectrum of brands, from emerging designers to established labels, which are looking to cater to Gen Z and Millennial brides looking for a less traditional take on wedding attire. This year, Badgley Mischka and The Atelier by Jimmy Choo were among the high-profile names at Barcelona Bridal Fashion Week, which was the largest edition in its history, and drew around 450 brands and buyers from over 80 countries.\n\nAsked whether Vivienne Westwood plans to stage a bridal fashion show annually, Kronthaler sidesteps the question but said the brand would look to stage a runway in other cities. “We would absolutely love to do a bridal show in New York. I love the city, and I hope we can make it happen very soon.”\n\nFor Kronthaler, his wife’s spirit lives on through the label’s non-conformist approach to bridalwear. He observed that multiple ensembles and multi-use looks are gaining popularity, as brides opt for various outfits that can be worn throughout their wedding day — and beyond. “Perhaps before (people) concentrated on one dress,” he said. “Today, brides love changing into different looks, to metamorphosize into different characters.”\n\nKronthaler continued: “It remains a wonderful thing to spend your life with someone — and I think you establish and celebrate this through what you wear on that special day.”', 'The next big fashion week?', 'Published 4:28 AM EDT, Fri April 25, 2025', 'how-vivienne-westwood-changed-the-way-brides-dress-forever-1745807748'),

He quickly became known for his simple, often unadorned regalia, in contrast to his predecessor, Pope Benedict XVI, who opted for gem-encrusted pectoral crosses, bright red designer loafers and archaic accessories — among them, a traditional velvet and ermine camauro that caught attention for its resemblance to a Santa hat.\n\nAccolades for Francis’ style soon followed: The Cut declared Francis the world’s “normcore pope” for his “simple, non-frilly” approach to dressing. He also became the first pontiff to land a Rolling Stone cover, and was dubbed by Esquire as 2013’s “Best-Dressed Man.” Not long after came the countless memes and unauthorized Etsy merch, with Francis’ likeness featured on a slew of T-shirts, sweatshirts and mugs in faux ‘90s bootleg designs.\n\n“While Bradley Cooper, Chris Pine, and Joseph Gordon-Levitt have all had banner years, their sartorial choices begin and end on the proverbial red carpet,” wrote Esquire’s Max Berlinger. “Meanwhile, Pope Francis’s sartorial decisions have subtly signaled a new era (and for many, renewed hope) for the Catholic Church.”\n\nThe feature was one of Esquire’s best-performing stories for months, according to Berlinger, who was subsequently invited onto several morning news shows to explain his controversial decision (he declined).\n\n“I just thought it was cool and worth mentioning,” he told CNN in a phone interview. “The Pope before him wore a lot of really ornate, expensive clothing. (Francis) was going to jails and washing the feet of prisoners. I remember thinking that this was part of a bigger shift, and that his clothes were a visual manifestation.”\n\nBefore the 2013 papal conclave, Francis, born Jorge Mario Bergoglio, wasn’t even considered as one of the top three frontrunners for the job. He appeared modest, humble and largely flew under the radar. But it was partly this understated demeanor, which differed so greatly to that of his predecessor, that sparked interest. “As the archbishop of Buenos Aires, Bergoglio had never been an especially gifted public speaker,” wrote Mark Binelli in the Rolling Stone’s cover story. “But now that he’s Pope Francis, his recognizable humanity comes off as positively revolutionary.”\n\nThough Francis’ style was often read as a show of his humility or asceticism, Carol Richardson, an ecclesiastical and art historian at the University of Edinburgh, said that the two popes’ sartorial contrasts represented deeper differences in their views on their roles as head of the Catholic Church.\n\n“Benedict XVI was playing with different periods of time through what he was wearing,” she explained in a video call. “As a traditionalist, (he was) asserting the historical continuity of the papacy.”\n\nBy appearing in early Christian chasubles (a sleeveless outer vestment worn during mass), and Ancient Roman palliums (a cloth band that loops around the neck), he was asserting “an unbroken link” from Jesus to St. Peter, the first pope, and all the way through to Benedict himself, according to Richardson.\n\nFrancis, being the first Jesuit pope, seemed to have different priorities, Richardson said, observing that Jesuits (originally known as the Society of Jesus) tend to “study languages, philosophy, and theology, history, rhetoric — it’s all about the application, the process of being a priest in the world,” she explained. “So there’s a practical application, which comes above any theoretical or historical interest.”\n\nDespite Francis’ minimization of symbolism, his all-white dress did bear meaning. White and red are the primary colors of papal dress, with white representing purity and charity, and red representing compassion and sacrifice.\n\nThere are no papal requirements for footwear color, though socks have traditionally been white or red, too. (Francis wore black; Benedict, crisp white). Black, the color of his shoes, has no official symbolism, though Richardson pointed out that Franciscan friars, who preach poverty and charity, are known to wear black shoes and sandals.\n\n“(They) probably are just the shoes that he would have worn as a priest,” she said.\n\nWhen the AI-generated image of Francis dressed in high-fashion streetwear went viral, the depiction was particularly absurd for a holy leader, let alone one so modest in style. However, Richardson saw a hint of truth as to why the hoax photography resonated with internet users as much as it did.\n\n“Although it was fake, it was still a gentle compliment to a pope who follows tradition… but also the fact that they are priests in the world as it is today,” she said. “(It’s) understanding the past and the present to move into the future.”', 'Practical differences', 'Published 6:01 AM EDT, Thu April 24, 2025', 'how-pope-francis-became-an-unlikely-fashion-icon-1745807748'),

It shattered the previous record of 97 mph set on June 26, 2007.\n\nThe culprit? A “dry microburst associated virga bomb,” according to the National Weather Service.\n\nThat’s the technical way to say the atmosphere just threw a knockout punch.\n\nTo explain what a dry microburst virga bomb really is, we need to zoom out a bit. Microbursts fall under the umbrella of a phenomenon called downbursts, which are strong wind events that develop because of how air moves up and down in thunderstorms.\n\nThunderstorms are fueled by an updraft of warm, rising air. Eventually, some of that air cools, forms precipitation and then a combination of wind and precipitation rushes to the ground in a downdraft.\n\nA downburst takes what a typical downdraft produces and cranks it to the extreme.\n\nPicture yourself dumping a bucket full of water directly onto the ground: It hits hard and splashes out from the center.\n\nDownbursts do just that, but with powerful winds that then move outward at high speeds. The strong winds typically last 5 to 10 minutes at most but can exceed 100 mph in the most extreme cases. Microbursts are downbursts that are less than 2.5 miles wide.\n\nDownbursts are typically either wet – precipitation and wind reach the ground – or dry – just wind reaches the ground. Texas’ microburst was dry.\n\nAs for the “virga bomb” part of the NWS report – that’s just a punchy way to say it was an impressively strong dry microburst. Virga is precipitation that falls from clouds but evaporates before it reaches the ground.\n\nDownbursts occur fairly frequently in powerful thunderstorms, but one this extreme is rare. Downbursts become more powerful when they move through a layer of drier air near the ground, as Tuesday’s did. Dry air evaporates precipitation in the downburst at the last second, which actually cools the surrounding air and makes it heavier. Heavier air hits the ground harder, producing stronger winds.\n\nTuesday’s 111 mph gust courtesy of that virga bomb would have been more at home in a hurricane than a random thunderstorm. Category 2 hurricanes, for example, have sustained winds of 96 to 110 mph but often produce gusts stronger than that range.\n\nThe strongest wind gust ever recorded in Texas stands at 180 mph and was produced by Hurricane Celia in August 1970, according to the state’s climatology office.\n\nThe hurricane-strength gusts from the fierce virga bomb did not damage Midland’s airport, but did break several power poles and knock over a semi-truck in nearby Odessa, according to the NWS.\n\nOther thunderstorms in the same area also produced strong winds that kicked up dangerous dust storms.', '', 'UPDATED APR 25, 2025', 'a-rare-virga-bomb-just-shattered-a-wind-record-in-texas-heres-what-it-is-1745807748'),

Sarah Huckabee Sanders’ request for individual and public assistance following an outbreak of severe storms and tornadoes that also affected neighboring Mississippi and Missouri and left more than 40 people dead.\n\nThe denial follows executive orders signed by Trump seeking to shift the burden of disaster response and recovery from the federal government onto states, as extreme weather becomes increasingly destructive and costly in a warming world. It is unclear how states will fill the financial void, which for decades has been viewed as a federal responsibility given the wide-reaching, multi-state nature of disasters.\n\nBoth Trump and Department of Homeland Security Sec. Kristi Noem have made it clear they want to eliminate FEMA, which spends billions each year helping people get temporary housing and rebuild after storms. FEMA also funds public assistance for municipalities after disasters, including tornadoes, hurricanes or wildfires.\n\nThe denial of the request, dated April 11, said the Trump administration had “determined that the damage from this event was not of such severity and magnitude as to be beyond the capabilities of the state, affected local governments, and voluntary agencies. Accordingly, we have determined that supplemental federal assistance is not necessary.”\n\nIt’s so far unclear whether Missouri and Mississippi will face similar denials. CNN reached out to the governor’s office in those states for comment. The White House did not immediately respond to CNN’s request for comment on why it denied the disaster request.\n\nIn 2023, former President Joe Biden granted an Arkansas disaster declaration request following deadly tornadoes within 48 hours of the storms.\n\nAs CNN has reported, billions of dollars in disaster aid were recently sitting untouched. More than $100 billion of previously awarded grant money and disaster assistance was frozen at FEMA for weeks, as agency staff awaited guidance for issuing payments in compliance with Trump’s executive orders restricting funding for immigration programs and sanctuary cities, a source with knowledge of the situation told CNN last month. FEMA has distributed most of its backlogged funds in recent days, and the temporarily frozen funding is different from individual disaster assistance funding.\n\nSanders has appealed the denial, writing in her letter to Trump “the state and its citizens are in dire need of assistance to recover, rebuild, and mitigate further loss.”\n\n“Without the support of a Major Disaster Declaration, Arkansas will face significant challenges in assuming full responsibility and achieving an effective recovery from this event,” Sanders wrote.\n\nIn lieu of federal funding, volunteer organizations in Arkansas are stepping up to try to fill the gap, said Lacey Kanipe, the spokesperson for the Arkansas Department of Public Safety.\n\n“The state has disaster recovery programs that provide a percentage of what FEMA may provide to survivors,” Kanipe said, adding it’s hard to quantify exactly how big the gulf is between what the state can support and what the federal government can provide.\n\nBiden FEMA administrator Deanne Criswell previously told CNN that FEMA’s mission isn’t to replace first responders. Instead, it is “to support state and local jurisdictions with their needs.”\n\n“They’re the ones that are on the ground,” Criswell told CNN in January. “They’re the ones that are responding, and we want to be able to bring them the resources as quickly as possible.”', '', 'UPDATED APR 24, 2025', 'tornado-victims-blocked-from-federal-recovery-aid-after-trump-denied-request-1745807748'),

Another one is on the way', 'https://edition.cnn.com/2025/04/18/weather/kentucky-floods-atmospheric-river-climate/index.html', 'Mary Gilbert', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/220802215041-kentucky-aerial-view-flood-300722.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_144,w_256,c_fill', '', 'An exceptionally powerful atmospheric river fueled the deadly early April flooding disaster in the central and southern United States — a historic flood event and a poignant example of how the phenomenon acts differently in the East than it does in the West.\n\nIt could signal added danger in a region less accustomed to hearing about them, particularly with another, less-potent one expected in the coming days.\n\nAtmospheric rivers are long, narrow streams of very moist air that act like a firehose to send gushing rain or snow where they point. They happen frequently around the globe, but are most well-known in the West, where they are responsible for a huge chunk of the region’s water supply and flood risk.\n\nBut early April’s was special, a Category 5.\n\n“This was an exceptional atmospheric river, regardless of where you are in the United States,” said Jay Cordeira, an atmospheric scientist with the Center for Western Weather and Water Extremes (CW3E). “It was as strong as they come.”\n\nScientists say atmospheric rivers are becoming more frequent and transporting more moisture as the world warms due to planet-heating fossil fuel pollution.\n\nThe Category 5 was one of multiple atmospheric rivers that flowed into parts of the South, Midwest and Appalachians in quick succession and provided “significant moisture which supported heavy rainfall” from April 1 to 7, according to a recent report from Cordeira and his colleagues at CW3E.\n\nSix to 10 inches of rain fell over more than 750 miles from northeastern Texas to the Kentucky-Ohio border, while more than a foot of rain fell in parts of Arkansas, Tennessee, Missouri and Kentucky in just three-to-four days, causing widespread and deadly flooding.\n\nFlash flood emergencies — the most severe flash flood warning — were issued in parts of five states. Hundreds of roads were flooded in Kentucky and the state ran out of road-closing barricades. More than 500 homes were damaged by floodwater in Frankfort, Kentucky, alone.\n\nAtmospheric rivers already occur much more frequently in the eastern half of the US than many people realize, according to Cordeira.\n\n“It’s kind of a misconception that they don’t happen on the East Coast, but they do happen with some regularity,” Cordeira explained. “The issue is that they don’t usually cause as many impacts as the ones on the West Coast.”\n\nExcept for when they do, like earlier this month, and potentially in the days to come.\n\nNew rounds of storms fueled by another atmospheric river will dump heavy rain from the southern Plains through parts of the Midwest this weekend, and “numerous” instances of flash flooding are likely in eastern Oklahoma, northern Arkansas and central Missouri, according to the Weather Prediction Center.\n\nA few important differences between West Coast atmospheric rivers and those that hit the eastern half of the US explain why their flood disasters are more common in the West but can have added danger in the East.\n\nThe biggest difference is where each atmospheric river pulls its moisture from. Those in the West tap into the Pacific Ocean; those in the East tap into the Caribbean Sea and what the US government now calls the Gulf of America, but is still known outside the US as the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nPacific atmospheric rivers pull together plenty of moisture, but the amount generated pales in comparison to the Gulf and Caribbean, which are basically the MVPs of warm, moist air. Plus, both are much warmer than normal, which could be supercharging how much moisture is on offer.\n\nMore moisture generally leads to more intense atmospheric rivers, multiple studies have shown. The amount of moisture that flowed into the US in early April was remarkable in its own right.\n\n“There’s only been one or two storms that have hit the West Coast in the last 60 years that have had that value of water vapor transport,” Cordeira said of the East’s Category 5 atmospheric river.\n\nIf eastern atmospheric rivers are generally juicier, why aren’t historic flooding events happening constantly? It has to do with the way each type wrings moisture out of the atmosphere.\n\nThe West’s mountainous terrain is mainly what sends rain pouring to the ground below, according to Cordeira. Moist air forced up the tall terrain will eventually condense due to changes in temperature and rain itself out.\n\nThe eastern half of the US also has mountains, but they’re not as tall and plentiful as those out West. Instead, eastern atmospheric rivers need to slam into a front to send rain gushing down, Cordeira explained.\n\nA front draped from Arkansas through Kentucky was stuck in place for days in early April. That front acted like the West’s mountains, forcing storms to form and dump torrential rain. But fronts like this aren’t always in place, so many atmospheric river events go by with their potential untapped.\n\nAtmospheric rivers out West also tend to dump their heaviest rain over the open water in the Pacific, because the storms they’re associated with typically peak in strength there. That’s not the case in the East. Eastern atmospheric rivers reach peak strength as they rush over land, putting many more people at risk of the most intense rain and flooding.\n\nKentucky and surrounding states have been a magnet for disaster this year. Disastrous flooding struck the Bluegrass State in mid-February, killing 12 people.\n\nAt the time, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear called the flooding “one of the most significant natural disasters we’ve seen in our lifetime.”\n\nThat event was also fueled by an atmospheric river, according to Cordeira — albeit one that wasn’t quite as strong and didn’t stick around for nearly as long as April’s.\n\nThe answer to why this keeps happening is found out over the Atlantic Ocean, between Florida and Bermuda. High pressure meanders in this area year-round and helps steer moisture from the Gulf and Caribbean into the US. Exactly where the bulk of it goes depends on the season.\n\nMoisture usually flows right through the central Gulf Coast and into Tennessee and Kentucky and then parts of the Midwest in the spring and fall. It shifts a bit east in the winter and a bit west in the summer.\n\n“Kentucky and Tennessee just end up being this prime geographic battleground where you can get the right ingredients of moisture to the south and some type of (front) to the north that overlap,” Cordeira explained.\n\nAnd it could get worse as the world warms.\n\nThe tropics are a “key source of moisture for atmospheric rivers” and as they warm the “moisture is intensifying the precipitation associated with these systems across the western and eastern United States,” the Fifth National Climate Assessment found.\n\nAtmospheric river studies have mainly focused on the West because of their more frequent impacts there, but eastern events have garnered more attention from researchers in recent years. A 2022 study found atmospheric rivers originating in the Gulf of Mexico are becoming more intense and larger with time as sea surface temperatures rise.', 'West vs. East', 'UPDATED APR 18, 2025', 'this-notorious-west-coast-phenomenon-fueled-historic-floods-in-the-east-another-one-is-on-the-way-1745807748'),

Presidents Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelensky held what American and Ukrainian officials described as a “productive” discussion in St. Peter’s Basilica, as Francis’ coffin was about to be brought into the square.\n\nSo, what was said, who met who, and where did everyone sit?\n\nSt. Peter’s Square was split into quarters. Dignitaries, cardinals and bishops were at the front, nearest the basilica, while clergy and the general public were a little further back. The coffin was placed in front of the central altar.\n\nBehind the seated sections, thousands more had packed into the square, standing for more than two hours in the Italian heat.\n\nIn the dignitaries’ section, politicians sat in alphabetical order in French, the traditional language of diplomacy.\n\nThis meant that Trump – president of “États-Unis d’Amerique” – sat between the presidents of Finland and Estonia, two nations that share borders with Russia, and which will be especially wary of a reduced US military footprint in Europe.\n\nFinland’s President, Alexander Stubb, played a round of golf with Trump in March during an unofficial trip to Florida. Trump said Stubb was a “very good player.” The Finnish presidency said the pair discussed European security, including Ukraine.\n\nDuring Saturday’s “Sign of Peace,” a rite where members of the congregation shake hands with their neighbors and say “peace be with you,” Trump was seen shaking hands with several world leaders, including French President Emmanuel Macron.\n\nThe only dignitaries not sat in alphabetical order were those from Italy – the host nation – and Argentina – Francis’ birthplace. Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni and Argentinian President Javier Milei were sat near the front, with a cluster of other officials.\n\nIn what was their first meeting since the explosive Oval Office meeting in February, Trump and Zelensky huddled in close discussion without aides in the ornate surroundings of St. Peter’s Basilica, shortly before the service began.\n\nBoth the White House and Ukrainian presidency said the talk lasted around 15 minutes, describing it as positive. Zelensky said the meeting was “symbolic,” with the “potential to become historic, if we achieve joint results.” The crowd in the square broke into applause when Zelensky stepped into the square.\n\n“We discussed a lot one on one. Hoping for results on everything we covered. Protecting lives of our people. Full and unconditional ceasefire. Reliable and lasting peace that will prevent another war from breaking out,” Zelensky wrote on X.\n\nThe US president and First Lady Melania Trump left Rome swiftly after the service, meaning the two leaders did not hold further discussions. Zelensky later met with Macron and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer. The four leaders were pictured together in the basilica, after Trump and Zelensky’s one-to-one.\n\nBritain’s Prince William was among a string of royals in Saturday’s crowd. William, next in line to the British throne, sat next to Olaf Scholz, the outgoing chancellor of Germany. Spain’s King Felipe and Queen Letizia, as well as Queen Mary of Denmark, were also in attendance.\n\nPolish President Andrzej Duda and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban were among several other European leaders in attendance. The South American leaders there included Brazil’s President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva – who had a close relationship with Francis – and Ecuador’s recently re-elected president Daniel Noboa.\n\nThe heads of several supranational institutions were also there, including Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus – head of the World Health Organization, from which Trump withdrew the US in January – and UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres.\n\nJulian Assange also made what was a rare public appearance since his release from Britain’s Belmarsh prison last year.

Francis has now been entombed at Rome’s Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore. Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re honored the pope’s ability to lead with “an open heart toward everyone” as he conducted today’s service.\n\n• World leaders pay respects: The roughly two-hour funeral in St. Peter’s Square featured an elaborate set of rituals and was attended by more than 100 delegations, including world leaders and reigning monarchs. It came six days after the first Latin American pontiff made his final public appearance for Easter.\n\n• High-stakes meeting: Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and US President Donald Trump met in St. Peter’s Basilica before the funeral as the White House mounts an increasingly urgent push to strike a deal ending Russia’s war.\n\nWe’ve wrapped up our live coverage of Pope Francis’ funeral. You can read more about today’s service here, or scroll through the posts below to relive the day as it happened.\n\nWith Pope Francis’ funeral services having drawn to a close, there is no concrete timeline for the choosing of a new pope, known as conclave, and plenty of mystery surrounds who will serve as Francis’ successor.\n\nThis conclave is going to be crucial for deciding the direction of the Roman Catholic Church, and the field of candidates is wide open thanks to Francis’ reforms, which made the body in charge of the election more representative of the worldwide church.\n\nConclave is not expected to begin earlier than 15 days, nor later than 20 days, after the pope’s death, likely placing it some time in early May.\n\nThe process is a combination of ancient tradition, religious ritual and politics. The voting takes place behind closed doors, and only cardinals under the age of 80 — slightly over half the total number — have a say in the decision.\n\nOnce the 135 members of the College of Cardinals are assembled in Rome, they meet in the Sistine Chapel to begin the decision-making process.\n\nConclaves go on for as long as it takes for one of the cardinals to receive two-thirds of the vote. Over the centuries, it has taken hours, days, weeks and even years for a new pope to be chosen.\n\nCheck out CNN’s guide to potential candidates here.\n\nThe graphic below lays out the steps we’ve seen so far — and what comes next:\n\nIn India, nuns dressed in white and blue lined the pews of an arched cathedral. In Britain, worshipers attended multiple masses at London’s Westminster Cathedral. And in the Philippines, children offered white flowers.\n\nMembers of the faithful around the world honored the late Pope Francis on his funeral Saturday. The 88-year-old pontiff — who was the first Latin American cardinal to hold the position — left an indelible mark on the 1.4 billion followers of the Catholic Church.\n\n“He didn’t come for the good ones, he came for the ones who are lost,” she added. “I wish I could be like him.”\n\nPope Francis had a great sense of humor. When I met him once at the back of the papal plane, I cracked a joke with him that was a little bit close to the line. Luckily, he roared with laughter and told me “Sei cattivo!” (“You’re naughty!”). Every day, he used to say, he prayed the words of St. Thomas More: “Lord, give me a sense of humor.”\n\nFrancis took what he did seriously. But he never took himself too seriously.\n\nOne thing that struck me about him was his intuition and pastoral instincts. Whatever the situation, he always seemed to find the right words to say. When I met him with my family one time, my youngest child was crying.\n\nHis ability to read people was also vital in his leadership. When he met bishops, he would get them into a circle and asked which one wanted to start speaking. It allowed him to understand the dynamics of a group, which helped him make appointments and decisions in the future.\n\nFrancis liked to make himself accessible. He would say his door was always open — but that same door also had a sign on it that read “no whining.”\n\nThere was never a dull moment covering his pontificate. As pope, he gave more media interviews than anyone else, but he never had a spokesperson or media advisers. Predicting his next move was notoriously difficult, and when it came to appointing new cardinals, no one knew when or who he’d be choosing in advance. New cardinals would talk about their phones blowing up in the middle of a Mass as people tried to contact them to tell them the news.\n\nFrancis wasn’t naïve, however. He was a politically savvy pope, very decisive and often stubborn. He wanted to stay true to himself and not become scripted. My enduring memory is of a very human pope who was full of surprises. He leaves big shoes to fill.\n\nA memorial Mass for Pope Francis is being held at St. Patrick’s Cathedral in New York City.\n\nCNN’s Brynn Gingras spoke with the faithful outside the religious landmark for US Catholics.\n\nDiane Solomon, who said she just returned from missionary work in Egypt, told CNN earlier this morning that she felt compelled to go into the cathedral to pay her respects to the pope.\n\nAnother woman, Tanya Brown, said: “I just love how he was such a people’s pope. He was kind. He always seemed to be the most like Jesus.”\n\nFrancis visited New York City in 2015, where he led prayers at St. Patrick’s, visited the 9/11 memorial, celebrated Mass in Madison Square Garden and spoke at the United Nations.\n\nCardinal Timothy Dolan, the archbishop of New York, reflected on Pope Francis’ warmth in an interview with CNN on Tuesday.\n\n“It’s like the world was sitting next to him on the front porch listening to your grandpa, sharing wisdom because he’s been through it all,” Dolan said.\n\nAs more than 250,000 mourners gathered for Pope Francis’ funeral in St. Peter’s Square this morning, world leaders took the opportunity to hold high-stakes meetings before and after the services.\n\nHere’s what you should know:\n\nZelensky’s meeting with Trump:\n\nZelensky’s meeting with Starmer:\n\nZelensky’s meeting with Meloni:\n\nOther interactions:\n\nPope Francis’ simple wooden coffin was driven through the streets of Rome on the popemobile this morning, passing the Colosseum and thousands of mourners on the way from St. Peter’s Basilica to the Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore.\n\nSee it here:\n\nSeveral people who attended Pope Francis’ funeral today told CNN they drove through the night to get there.\n\nClemence Grange, from France, divided up the overnight driving with her sisters and a friend. The group of four women left Lyon on Friday night at 7 p.m. local time (1 p.m. ET). By around 6 a.m., they had made it to just outside the Vatican, feeling “joy” but also sadness.\n\nShe added that she was proud of his commitments to the environment and to the poor.\n\nAnita Althaus, 65, drove with a friend overnight from Germany’s Black Forest region to make it in time. It took them 14 hours to reach Rome.\n\nIn Pope Francis’ birthplace of Buenos Aires, thousands of mourners gathered to honor one of their own. A special Mass is underway in the Argentine capital, where Francis — born Jorge Mario Bergoglio in 1936 — lived and served until he became the 266th pope in 2013.\n\nCNN’s David Culver is bringing us sentiment from the scene. He said people have been gathering overnight, many traveling from all parts of the city and surrounding provinces to take part in the tribute.\n\n“This is their time to say goodbye to one of their own,” Culver said. “This mix of, I would say, joyfulness and there’s almost a rally-like attitude. You see people, they’ve got their banners, they’ve got T-shirts they’ve had made, music has been playing. For them this is, while a difficult moment, a celebratory one, too.”\n\nMany in Buenos Aires speak of Francis with a striking sense of personal connection.\n\n“They’re so at ease with who he is as a human being, they had him for 76 years here,” Culver said.\n\nHere, it is common to hear residents recall direct encounters with the pope. “You ask, ‘Did you know Pope Francis before he was Pope Francis?’ and it is so matter-of-fact. People say, ‘Oh yes, he baptized my granddaughter,’ or, ‘He washed my son’s feet,’” Culver added.\n\nPope Francis’ funeral this morning followed many traditions, but also included a few surprises, according to CNN’s Vatican correspondent Christopher Lamb.\n\nHere are some surprises of the day:\n\nPope Francis embarked on 47 foreign trips during his papacy, including a landmark tour in Asia, an unprecedented visit to Iraq and multiple trips throughout Latin America.\n\nToday’s funeral homily emphasized his international and interfaith diplomacy, as well as his diplomatic focus on migrants.\n\nMuslim Imam Beytullah Colak expressed deep admiration for Francis’ work with Muslim refugees and promoting interfaith dialogue, telling CNN: “We love him.” Colak traveled from the United States to the Vatican to express gratitude for the pontiff’s work.\n\nAs the first pope from the Global South, the Francis also made a point of reaching out to Catholics outside of Europe, including calling a parish in Gaza City nearly every night. He prioritized engaging with the Catholic church’s followers in Asia, with a landmark visit to Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, East Timor and Singapore last year.\n\nTeresa Muthikul, who moved to Rome from Thailand, said she last saw the pope in 2019, and it felt important to come back to the Vatican this week to bid him farewell. “He taught us many things during his life — not only through his words, but also through his actions.”\n\nPope Francis has been interred at the Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore in Rome, the Vatican said Saturday.\n\nThe “rite of the Entombment of the Roman Pontiff” began at 1 p.m. local time (7 a.m. ET), in a ceremony presided over by Cardinal Kevin Farrell, the “camerlengo” who had been tasked with making arrangements for Francis’ funeral, and who will soon help organize a conclave to choose Francis’ successor.\n\nThe ceremony concluded at 1:30 p.m. local time, the Vatican added.\n\nFrancis is the first pope in more than a century to be buried outside the walls of the Vatican. In his will, the late pontiff asked that his tomb be inscribed only with the word: “Franciscus.”\n\nMore than 250,000 worshipers, religious and political figures lined St. Peter’s Square, in the Vatican, on Saturday to pay their respects to the late Pope Francis, who died earlier this week at the age of 88.\n\nThe service started at St. Peter’s Basilica shortly after 10 a.m. local time (4 a.m. ET), lasting just over two hours.\n\nCardinal Giovanni Battista Re, one of the most senior figures in the Catholic Church, led the simplified ceremony, in a series of rituals of religious hym﻿ns, an emotional homily and a final farewell to the pope, who was the first Latin American pontiff.\n\nFrancis’ modest coffin was then transported in the white popemobile over the River Tiber to be entombed in Rome’s Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore – an illuminated basilica that sits atop the highest point in the Italian capital.\n\nHere’s how the day unfolded:\n\n• Mourners and world leaders assemble: The pope’s funeral saw one of the largest gatherings of world leaders in recent years. A total of 130 delegations, including presidents and reigning monarchs, were in attendance. Argentine President Javier Milei, Britain’s Prince William, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, US President Donald Trump and Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky were among the most high-profile guests.\n\n• Trump and Zelensky summit: The US and Ukrainian leaders met minutes before the funeral began Saturday, speaking face-to-face on two chairs that had been set up inside the St. Peter’s Basilica. A White House spokesman accompanying Trump said that the two leaders “had a very productive discussion.” A spokesman for Zelensky said the meeting lasted for about 15 minutes, and the leaders agreed to continue talks. The Ukrainian leader also held sideline meetings with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer and French President Emmanuel Macron.\n\n• High security: Authorities in Rome ramped up security measures ahead of the service, deploying more than 2,000 police officers, sharpshooters and specialist forces. A further 400 traffic officers were on shift, the city’s police department told CNN.\n\n• ‘Pope among the people:’ The 91-year-old Re eulogized the late pontiff’s “deeply sensitive” leadership, in a poignant sermon read out on the footsteps of St. Peter’s Basilica. “Faced with the raging wars of recent years, with their inhuman horrors and countless deaths and destruction, Pope Francis incessantly raised his voice imploring peace,” said Re. The late pontiff insistently advocated for communities in war-ravaged regions until his final days, including in Gaza, Ukraine, Sudan and South Sudan.\n\n• Young worshipers pay respects: An array of mourners, including streams of young people and pilgrims from Indonesia, the US, the Philippines and France, pitched up at St. Peter’s Square overnight - a testament to Pope Francis’ wide appeal. Some of his most liberal supporters believe he was not reformist enough, but others say he has carved a progressive legacy in his wake, having transformed the Catholic Church for its 1.4 billion followers.\n\nTo the world, he was Pope Francis. To the people of Buenos Aires, Argentina, he was Cardinal Bergoglio.\n\nFrancis was born in Buenos Aires in 1936. Before becoming pope, he served as the city’s archbishop for 15 years.\n\nAt a bus stop in Buenos Aires, dozens of mourners are traveling to the Plaza de Mayo, one of the central sites of the Argentine capital, for a mass to commemorate Pope Francis.\n\nOn board one of the several buses taking mourners to today’s mass, two women told CNN how Francis — after becoming pope — would still send letters back to his archdiocese every year, using a fax machine.\n\nThe buses, which Francis rode regularly during his many years in the city, have been set up specially today by authorities.\n\nThousands of miles away in Rome, Francis has reached his final resting place.\n\nFormer US Secretary of State John Kerry said attending Pope Francis’ funeral was “extraordinarily moving,” as he reflected on the pontiff’s “remarkable character, approach and his humility.”\n\nKerry, who also attended the funeral of Pope John Paul II, said today’s farewell to Francis felt more emotional.\n\n“In this case I think there was more emotion, more connection, a great passion for what he was fighting to do,” he said.\n\nReflecting on his own encounters with Francis — both in the White House and at the Vatican — Kerry said what struck him most was that the pope was “just so straightforward.”\n\nMourners who camped out at Rome’s Colosseum lauded “the people’s pope” today as they waited for Pope Francis’ funeral hearse to weave past a series of historical landmarks in the Italian capital.\n\nAbout 150,000 people gathered along the procession route in Rome, where the white popemobile carrying Francis’ coffin reached the Basilica di Santa di Maria Maggiore to be buried.\n\nSeveral people told CNN they admired the pope’s “humanity” — characterizing his wide appeal among Catholic communities and beyond.\n\n“Even though I’m not Catholic, he is a significant person in the world, in the history, and I really admire him,” Yuji Sugiyama, a 55-year-old from the US, told CNN.\n\nAnother onlooker, Miguel Angel Tarditti, 65, remembered Francis as “the most important personality of this time.”\n\nFour out of five of the cardinals who will soon select the next pontiff owe their positions to Pope Francis.\n\nOf the 135 members of the College of Cardinals under the age of 80 who are eligible to appoint the next pontiff, Pope Francis installed 108. That means 80% of the votes cast in the upcoming conclave will be cast by cardinals elevated by Francis.\n\nThe conclave, which must be held in the coming days, will be “one of the most diverse that we’ve had in the history of the church,” Susan Timoney, a professor at the Catholic University of America in Washington DC, told CNN.\n\nDuring his 12-year papacy, Francis appointed more than 20 cardinals from countries that had never previously had a cardinal, nearly all from developing countries, including Mongolia, Laos, Papua New Guinea and Mali.\n\nBecause many of the cardinals appointed by previous popes turned 80 during Francis’ papacy, this “generation shift in the age of the cardinals” allowed him to appoint new members from different parts of the world, Timoney said.\n\nTimoney added that the conversations between cardinals ahead of the conclave are often crucial in determining the next pope.\n\n“That’s where the cardinals come together. They talk about: ‘What are our priorities? What do we really need to be doing as a church?’” she said.\n\nGiven how many cardinals owe their positions to Francis, some have speculated that this could lead the conclave to appoint a successor that will continue to follow his pastoral priorities.\n\nThere is no concrete timeline for the choosing of a new pope, known as conclave. It is not expected to begin earlier than 15 days, nor later than 20 days, after the pope’s death.\n\nConclave cannot start during “novendiali” - the nine days of mourning that began with Pope Francis’ funeral today.\n\nConclave is a combination of ancient tradition, religious ritual and politics. The voting takes place behind closed doors. Only cardinals under the age of 80 – slightly over half the total number – have a say in the decision.\n\nOnce the 135 members of the College of Cardinals are assembled in Rome, they meet in the Sistine Chapel to begin the decision-making process.\n\nConclaves take as long as it takes for one of the cardinals to receive two-thirds of the vote. Over the centuries, it has taken hours, days, weeks and even years for a new pope to be chosen. Pope Francis was appointed in a little over a day.\n\nPope Francis’ “insistence” on working for the poor was woven into today’s funeral events, with groups of underprivileged people invited to watch the service in St. Peter’s Square.\n\nThose involved were chosen by the charity, Sant’Egidio, and they represented groups he felt were marginalized – including the homeless, migrants, the impoverished and a group of transgender women who live in a convent in Rome.\n\nA group of marginalized people was also invited to line the steps of his final resting place, Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore, at the end of the funeral procession.\n\nThe Argentine pope believed “the poor have a privileged place in the heart of God,” a Holy See statement issued before the funeral said.\n\n“For this reason, a group of poor and needy people will be present on the steps leading to the papal Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore to pay their last respects to Pope Francis before the burial of his coffin.”\n\nPope Francis, who chose his name in honor of St. Francis of Assisi, with his commitment to poverty, peace and nature, wanted to reflect his own dedication to the homeless and disadvantaged.\n\n“Pope Francis has done so much for people like me, people who are struggling, people who are unable to even pay to have our clothes washed,” said Anna Melnyk, a 30-year-old Ukrainian woman who came to Rome before the war. She regularly used a laundromat the late pope had set up for people in need. “He has made us feel like part of his family, especially those of us who have no families of our own,” she told CNN.\n\nFlorian Gretz, 66, who has been camping out near the Vatican for several years, recounted the time Pope Francis invited homeless people to dine inside the Vatican’s Paul VI Audience Hall in 2023. “He treated us with respect and dignity, we sat at tables and ate with silverware,” Gretz said. “Will the next pope do that?”\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said his meeting with US President Donald Trump in St. Peter’s Basilica was “symbolic,” and the White House said the two leaders had a “very productive discussion.”\n\n“Good meeting. We discussed a lot one on one,” Zelensky wrote Saturday on X.\n\nWhite House officials said the meeting lasted around 15 minutes and was “very productive.”\n\nThe meeting inside the basilica came just before Pope Francis’ funeral began in St. Peter’s Square and did not appear to have been telegraphed in advance.\n\nAhead of the US president’s brief visit to Rome, officials had downplayed the prospect he would meet with Zelensky or any other world leaders, pointing to the truncated time frame for the trip and its solemn purpose of bidding farewell to the late pope.\n\nTrump had originally selected Saudi Arabia for his first stop abroad of his new term and will visit there next month. But when Francis died those plans changed, and instead Trump made his first foreign stop in Europe, a continent he’s railed against frequently.', '', 'Updated 3:12 PM EDT, Sat April 26, 2025', 'pope-francis-laid-to-rest-after-250000-attend-funeral-service-1745807748'),

The soaring structure was built using “mega columns” to protect against strong winds and earthquakes, while its “walking stick” design was topped by a diamond-shaped atrium containing a swimming pool and observation deck. It was set to contain offices and a five-star hotel on the upper floors, according to architects P&T Group.\n\nBut the project came to a standstill following the 2015 Chinese stock market crash that plunged the future of Hong Kong-based Goldin Properties Holdings into doubt. The real estate developer, whose founder Pan Sutong was once among Hong Kong’s richest businessmen, has since gone into liquidation.\n\nA new construction permit — which reportedly lists a contract value of almost 569 million yuan ($78 million) — suggests the defunct developer’s title may have been dropped from the building’s name, according to state media. It is unclear whether plans for the “supertall” skyscraper’s use remain unchanged. Neither P&T Group nor BGI Engineering Consultants, the state-owned company named on the permit, responded to CNN’s requests for comment.\n\nOver the last decade, the abandoned skyscrapers littering China’s skylines have become emblematic of the country’s real estate woes. In 2020, its housing ministry and National Development and Reform Commission issued guidelines banning new towers over 500 meters (1,640 feet) in height — a move seemingly aimed, in part, at reining in the speculative financing often underpinning skyscraper projects.\n\nOn Monday, China’s Greenland Group announced that work is also resuming on the previously stalled Chengdu Greenland Tower in the southwestern city of Chengdu, local state-owned media reported. Construction of the 468-meter-tall (1,535-foot) skyscraper has been on hold since 2023, after the state-owned developer encountered financial difficulties, according to Reuters.\n\nThe fact that two high-profile projects are resuming at the same time is unlikely to be a coincidence, said Qiao Shitong, a law professor at Duke University School of Law and the author of two books on Chinese real estate.\n\n“The national government has made it clear it wants to stabilize the real estate market,” said Qiao over a video call, adding that it has been encouraging local governments to help “revive” the struggling sector. “It is signaling to the market — (it’s) not only about the skyscrapers themselves.”\n\nAlthough the Tianjin tower’s new financing is yet to be disclosed, Qiao believes the state has offered investment and debt restructuring to help kickstart the project.\n\n“(Supertall skyscrapers) are not necessarily the most efficient projects and they are not necessarily making profits, but they are indicators,” he said. “By having this project revived and completed, the government at least hopes it can increase people’s confidence.”\n\nFor local officials, completing abandoned skyscrapers is also about “the image of the city,” said Fei Chen, a reader in architecture and urban design at the UK’s University of Liverpool. “They don’t want a project to be unfinished and to stay like that, which is an eyesore for everyone.”\n\nChen stressed, however, that the resumption of projects in Tianjin and Chengdu is unlikely to herald a return to the “vanity projects” of recent years.\n\n“The government is conscious that although these (skyscraper) projects have some positive effects on the area, they require too much investment and are not financially or environmentally sustainable… I think the general urban development trend is not changed by the fact that some projects are being resumed. I think it’s more about local government efforts to make their city better.”\n\nDespite economic concerns and tightening regulations, China continues to dominate global skyscraper construction. Of the 133 skyscrapers measuring 200 meters or above completed around the world last year, 91 were in China, according to data from the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat.\n\nChen said that skyscrapers, although expensive to build, are often used by developers as “magnets” for investment in the surrounding area. Goldin Finance 117, for instance, was part of a wider development containing villas, commercial buildings and offices, as well as a convention center, entertainment center and polo club. The fate of these projects is not explicitly outlined in the new construction permit, though it reportedly describes the development of several “commercial corridors.”\n\nBut with sluggish property sales and struggling office occupancy rates across China, the project’s economic viability remains in question, said Qiao. “It’s a huge investment,” he added “And I seriously don’t know who is going to buy or rent this commercial space.”\n\nDuring the decade-long hiatus, Tianjin welcomed another supertall skyscraper — the Tianjin CTF Finance Centre, which at 530 meters (1,739 feet) is currently the world’s eighth tallest completed building. Goldin Finance 117 has meanwhile been surpassed in height by both the twisting Shanghai Tower and the Ping An Finance Centre in Shenzhen, meaning it would now only become the country’s third tallest (and the world’s sixth tallest) skyscraper upon completion.\n\nIt will fall to eighth globally if Saudi Arabia’s kilometer-high Jeddah Tower — on which construction also recently resumed, following a years-long hiatus — and Dubai’s Burj Azizi are both completed later this decade.', '', 'Published 10:15 PM EDT, Thu April 24, 2025', 'construction-of-worlds-tallest-abandoned-skyscraper-to-resume-after-a-decade-1745807748'),

He died in 1926, when only an estimated 10%-15% of the project had been built, including one transept, a crypt and some of the apse wall.\n\nAlthough Gaudí dedicated the remaining few years of his life and career exclusively to the Sagrada Família, other buildings bearing his distinctive style are dotted all over Barcelona, lending the city much of its character.\n\nFor decades, there has been a movement calling for Gaudí’s beatification, known as the Association for the Beatification of Antoni Gaudí.

Photos of him wearing an enormous brown blanket scarf, which resurface each year, have become a reliable indicator of the approaching winter. And he’s never far from a pair of leather pants, which the 60-year-old American musician proved last year when he posted a video to TikTok bench pressing while doing sit-ups at the gym in black leather, a sheer mesh tank and sunglasses. (“This isn’t how everyone’s dad works out?” his daughter, the actor Zoë Kravitz, asked “The Tonight Show” host Jimmy Fallon in response to the video).\n\nBut over the years, the rock star has also provided a window into his life through his homes, from the idyllic Brazilian ranch that Architectural Digest (AD) toured in 2019, to the beachside Airstream trailer he occupies for part of the year in the Bahamian island of Eleuthera. For AD’s “Star Power” issue, published today, Kravitz is showing off the grand Paris townhouse he has had for two decades and was the previous palatial home of a countess.\n\nKravitz was taken aback by the enormous space when he first saw it, located in the 16th arrondissement, the French capital’s home to embassies, museums and luxury shopping. In the early 2000s, he had already released several Platinum albums, but had in mind something more modest: “a little apartment, maybe on the Seine — one bedroom, two bedrooms, maximum — where I could write and hang out,” he recalled to AD.\n\nIt was his real estate agent who encouraged him to see the “once-in-a-generation” listing, he added. When he arrived, he thought perhaps he was touring a single floor, not the entire property.\n\n“I said, ‘No, no, no, no, absolutely not.’” Inside though, his feelings changed. “I walked in and said, ‘This is my house.’ Spiritually, I knew.”\n\nYears later, the home feels undeniably his — “a true reflection of his personality and creative energy,” noted Marina Hemonet, head of editorial content for AD France, in an email to CNN.\n\nFrom the airy interiors outfitted with work by blue-chip artists, traditional African art and some of his own studio’s furniture designs — Kravitz Design was included in the prestigious AD100 list in 2023 — to the eccentric wine room and red-lit subterranean party space he calls “The Chaufferie,” the musician has continued to transform the space as an extension of himself. (Though he’s not the only Kravitz to enjoy the home, as Zoë has “been having a lot of soirées” in the speakeasy-esque boiler room, he told AD.)\n\n“The things he surrounds himself with — (Andy) Warhol masterpieces, African artifacts, major music memorabilia, and rare furnishings by Paul Evans, Karl Springer, Afra and Tobia Scarpa, Joe Colombo, and others — offer an astounding feast of the dreamily recherché,” AD’s global editorial director, Amy Astley, who leads AD U.S., wrote in the issue’s editor’s letter.\n\nKravitz’s sensibility reflects his upbringing, he noted to the magazine. He often moved between his parents’ Upper East Side apartment in Manhattan — his mother, Roxie Roker, was an actor best known for “The Jeffersons;” his father, Sy Kravitz, was a TV producer for NBC — to his grandparents’ home in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn.\n\n“Two completely different worlds,” he said.\n\nHe calls his aesthetic “soulful elegance,” which is “comfortable, clearly. But also chic,” he explained. “I love that balance of African, European, and Afrofuturism mixed with midcentury pieces. I love things that are extremely glamorous and also extremely brutal.”\n\nAnd though artworks by Andy Warhol, Jean-Michel Basquiat and Richard Avedon hang on his walls, it’s a portrait by the photographer Ruven Afanador of Kravitz’s late grandfather, Albert Roker, that he considers a centerpiece of his home. Afanador photographed the cover for the musician’s fourth album, “Circus,” released in 1995, and his grandfather attended the shoot.\n\n“I put my grandfather in one of my suits, and Ruven took a bunch of portraits of him. He is why I am here, and why I’m in this house, why my mom went to Howard University in DC and studied at the Shakespeare Institute in Stratford-upon-Avon and became who she became, then I became who I became, and Zoë became who she became,” Kravitz said. “It’s all him.

But Expos of recent decades have been as much about diplomacy and public relations as innovation.\n\nIt is little surprise, therefore, that the mastermind behind Expo 2025 — which commences this weekend in Osaka, Japan, just three years after the end of Dubai’s Covid-delayed Expo 2020 — doesn’t express his vision in terms of scientific or industrial progress. In an era of increasing conflict, the message is all about unity.\n\n“The whole global situation is very unstable,” said Japanese architect Sou Fujimoto, touring CNN around the site ahead of Saturday’s opening ceremony. “I believe this is a really precious opportunity to show (that) so many countries can come together in one place and think about our future together.”\n\nJapan hopes to welcome 28 million visitors to the event between now and mid-October. Designed by Fujimoto on a 960-acre artificial island in Osaka Bay, the site will host over 150 pavilions showcasing new technology, design concepts and multimedia exhibitions under the theme “Designing Future Society for Our Lives.”\n\nAmong them are dozens of national entries, from the serenely minimalist US pavilion to the corkscrew-shaped Czech one. The main attraction, however, is the venue itself: Fujimoto’s Grand Ring, a continuous wooden structure, more than 1.2 miles in circumference, encircling much of the Expo.\n\nMade from Japanese cedar and cypress (as well as Scottish pine), it now holds the Guinness World Record for the world’s largest wooden architectural structure. The Grand Ring is symbol of unity, too, Fujimoto said. And while it serves a functional purpose as a pedestrian route around the site, while protecting visitors from rain and sun, the structure was also designed to demonstrate the possibilities of timber as a viable alternative to carbon-intensive concrete.\n\n“At the beginning, nobody believed it was possible,” Fujimoto said, describing the technical challenges of building with wood at such scale as “so huge.”\n\nThe use of wood in large structures, even skyscrapers, has accelerated in recent years. It’s a trend spurred by the development of advanced “mass timber” — typically made by gluing layers of compressed wood into strong columns or panels — and progressive building codes and policies promoting its use (France, for instance, now requires all new public buildings to include at least 50% wood).\n\nEngineered timber nonetheless remains novel in much of the world. But Japan has a long and continuous history of wooden architecture. The devastating earthquakes of 1891 and 1923 exposed the shortcomings of then-popular European-style brick and stone buildings. Today, around 90% of Japan’s single-family homes are built using timber frames, which are better equipped to withstand quakes.\n\nAs such, Fujimoto’s Grand Ring looks both to the material’s future and its past. He combined modern construction methods (including steel reinforcement) with interlocking joints inspired by those traditionally used in Shinto temples and shrines. These joints required exhaustive study, with mockups made and stress-tested — sometimes to the point of destruction — to ensure their durability and seismic resistance.\n\nFujimoto believes his country can remain a world leader in timber construction. It is a movement he has pioneered, alongside architectural luminaries like Shigeru Ban and Toyo Ito, since his eponymous firm’s breakout project: a home in Kumamoto, completed in 2008 and named Final Wooden House, that resembles an oversized Jenga tower.\n\n“We have such a wonderful tradition of wooden construction,” Fujimoto said. “And also, really wonderful craftsmanship from more than 1,000 years ago. So now, we can combine that kind of tradition with the latest technology to create the future of sustainable architecture.”\n\nThe road to Expo 2025 has been, at times, bumpy for Japan. Venue construction costs have ballooned from an initial estimate of 125 billion yen ($852 million) to 235 billion yen ($1.6 billion). Public interest has meanwhile proven lukewarm, with Osaka’s governor Hirofumi Yoshimura last month admitting that the city was struggling to meet its advance ticket sale targets.\n\nOn both matters, Fujimoto struck a diplomatic note. He described the final costs as the “proper price, not too high, not too low,” while expressing hope for growing “passions and energetic interest” from the Japanese public. “The atmosphere is changing now,” he added. “So, I’m optimistic about it.”\n\nWhile Fujimoto can justifiably distance himself from blame, there is another controversy to which he is more intimately tied: the fate of the Grand Ring.\n\nWhether, or how much of, the structure will live on after the Expo is a matter of ongoing debate in Japan. It is also a bone of contention among critics who believe that dismantling the structure would undermine its message of sustainability. Regardless of his wish that nothing goes to waste, the architect realizes that the decision may hinge on the funding required for upkeep and future events.\n\n“I, myself, (would) really like to keep it — to preserve it … because it is really wonderful, and it is like a symbol of how our society can live together with nature,” he said.\n\nYet, Fujimoto also notes that impermanence has always been a feature of Japanese architecture. Traditionally, the country’s wooden homes were constructed with an expected lifespan of 20 years, and many Japanese people would sooner rebuild their house than renovate it. Some of Shintoism’s most important structures, including the famous Ise Grand Shrine, have been regularly torn down and rebuilt over the centuries, posing a philosophical question — akin to the ship of Theseus paradox — of whether a building is more than the sum of its material parts.\n\nThe architect implored that, should the Grand Ring be dismantled, its wood is repurposed in other projects. Then, “even though the building is gone, the life or spirit of the materials will still be alive,” he said. In any case, the legacy he envisaged for the Expo is an intangible one: “Amazing memories and surprising experiences that inspire (visitors) to create something for the future.”\n\nOne of Japan’s most celebrated living architects, Fujimoto was an obvious choice for Expo organizers. As well as practicing widely in Japan, the 53-year-old has become internationally renowned since being asked to design a temporary pavilion at London’s Serpentine Gallery, one of architecture’s most prestigious commissions, in 2013.\n\nOther recent high-profile projects include the striking L’Arbre Blanc (“The White Tree”) residential tower in Montpellier, France, and the House of Hungarian Music, an airy arts venue whose perforated dome sits nestled among trees in a Budapest park.\n\nBoth projects are emblematic of Fujimoto’s architectural philosophy, dubbed “primitive future,” which explores the symbiotic links between people, design and the environment. It’s an outlook he has often attributed to his upbringing, amid nature, in Hokkaido, Japan’s northernmost island.\n\nFittingly, greenery is woven throughout his Expo 2025 design. “(We) couldn’t live without nature,” he said, adding that the site should “show how we can be together with the cycle of nature.”\n\nAt the heart of this year’s expo lies the “Forest of Tranquility,” a congregation of around 1,500 trees, including native species like Japanese blue oak, Japanese maple and Japanese snowbell. Among them are trees replanted from Expo ’70’s Commemorative Park, some 13 miles northeast of the site, which serves as a permanent reminder of the last time Osaka hosted the World’s Fair.\n\nArchitecturally, much has changed in the intervening 55 years. Expo ‘70, held the year after the moon landing, played out under a giant “space frame” roof and exhibited a moon rock brought back to Earth by Apollo 12. The event’s lead designer, the late avant-garde architect Kenzo Tange, was known for conceptual floating cities and grand, outlandish megastructures.\n\nFujimoto described the event as “a glorious moment of Japan in the 20th century,” but emphasized the difference between his Grand Ring and his predecessor’s centerpiece design: “Kenzo Tange’s roof represented technology and industry… but our ring is made from wood and is a symbol of sustainability.”\n\nJapan itself has also transformed since the previous Osaka Expo, an event alive with the hopes of post-World War II social reinvention. For Fujimoto, not all this change has been for the better. As such, his call for unity at Expo 2025 appears to be directed as much toward his compatriots as the world at large.\n\n“Japanese society is getting rather conservative and not so open,” he said. “(It is) rather closed to other countries and cultures… So, I believe this is a wonderful occasion (to) reconnect Japanese culture to the world.”\n\nCNN’s Hazel Pfeifer, Yumi Asada and Daniel Campisi contributed to this story.', 'Fate of the Ring', 'Published 10:00 PM EDT, Thu April 10, 2025', 'architect-sou-fujimoto-expo-2025-is-a-precious-opportunity-to-come-together-1745807748');

Bisecting the area like a vein is J.K. Randle Road. To one side of its pavement, flaking gray walls ring the Nigerian National Museum, a near-70-year-old remnant from the era of British colonial rule.\n\nDirectly opposite, its red and gold lattices arcing over a perimeter of lush greenery towards the sky, the John Randle Centre for Yoruba History and Culture opened last October and is challenging the traditional Western model of what a museum is meant to be.\n\nInviting visitors to step into a “fantasy land” of Yoruba folklore, the Centre is a living manifestation of the culture that binds Nigeria’s second-largest ethnic group, as well as a loud, colorful “alternative narrative” to the one told across the road, says the project’s lead architect Seun Oduwole.\n\n“It objectifies the culture, as opposed to celebrating it,” he said of the National Museum’s “Eurocentric” approach.\n\nIn 2018, Lagos-based architectural firm SI.SA was commissioned to build the Centre on a site where, in the 1920s, Sierra-Leone born local physician John Randle had funded the construction of a swimming pool where Nigerians could learn to swim, at a time when the country was a British colony.\n\nDr. Will Rea, a British academic specializing in African art and Yoruba history, was born in Nigeria and worked under the Nigerian National Commission for Museums and Monuments before joining the John Randle Centre project as lead consultant curator.\n\nRea saw it as a chance to prove that Nigeria could produce museums of the highest quality, while also challenging how the continent has often been depicted in Western museums.\n\n“Africa tends to be sort of dark and brown, and there’s a lack of color,” said Rea, who was charged with writing the academic narrative for the Centre and deciding what objects were needed. “If you go to the British Museum (in London), you’ll see that Africa is in the basement. It’s beautifully spotlit, but it’s still very much things stuck behind vitrines (display cabinets), and you can’t really move.\n\n“It’s very different to what the experience of being on the street in Lagos or Ikole (a town in southwest Nigeria) actually is. So we were keen to have a very lively place, full of color and sound – very different to a normal Western museum, where everything is kind of hushed.”\n\nOduwole added: “A lot of times our culture is viewed as this sort of archaic, ancient civilization that was pulled out of the darkness. We wanted to break that.”\n\nBut the pair’s ambition immediately ran into a critical problem: they had no collection to build a museum around.\n\nSo began a mad dash for Oduwole, Rea and a host of hired collectors, who fanned out across Nigeria and international museums to look for artefacts of Yoruba origin.\n\nMany were too expensive to buy outright, meaning that procuring loans became the primary solution. A partnership was secured with the British Museum to send a selection of objects on a long-term loan basis — among them, the Lander Stool.\n\nThis Yoruba wood carving was taken to the UK by British explorer Richard Lander following an expedition to Nigeria in the 1830s and has since become a symbol of the long-running restitution debate concerning the return of African cultural objects, says Rea.\n\nIn 2019, the Lagos State government formally asked for the return of the stool, designating the upcoming Centre a “befitting home.” Oduwole says a long-term loan has been agreed, although it is yet to go on display at the Centre.\n\nEasing the pressure was the decision that artefacts would make up just a quarter of the exhibition space, designed by international museum exhibition design firm Ralph Appelbaum Associates.\n\nThe team were determined to portray Yoruba culture as dynamic and ever-changing, an ongoing story that had to be experienced via a multitude of senses. For example, the music of Afrobeat legend Fela Kuti was an evolution of Oríkì praise poetry sung in small Yoruba villages that incorporates drums and dance, Rea explained.\n\nTo reflect this, only the first of the exhibition’s four main areas focuses on the past. After a section on Yoruba myths and legends, visitors are taken on a journey through modern-day customs and practices ending at an imagined future Yoruba culture.\n\nInteractive opportunities are abundant throughout. The team contacted Jimi Solanke, the baritone voice for a generation of young Nigerians courtesy of his popular after-school TV shows, to record some of his children’s stories onto a radiogram (a record player incorporated into furniture). Though Solanke died last year, his tales endure for a new generation in the Centre, playing out under a tree to mimic the setting where Yoruba elders traditionally passed on information to youngsters.\n\nStepping in front of one camera will transform guests via digital projection into Egúngún masquerades, wooden-mask-wearing figures who embody the spirits of ancestors during ritual and festival performances.\n\n“I’ve never seen anything like that in a Western museum,” Rea said. “Whether that’s US, or UK, or Nigeria, the technology in there is really cutting edge. It’s quite phenomenal.”\n\nVisitors are also turned into various Yoruba deities, the Orisha. Visualizing Shango, the god of thunder, as a superhero-like figure presented a chance to reimagine often “misunderstood” Yoruba deities in the same way the Marvel Cinematic Universe has done for figures in the Ancient Greek and Nordic pantheon, Oduwole explained.\n\nIt’s another way of celebrating how Yoruba’s heritage is relevant in the modern world, with Rea highlighting Beyoncé’s allusions to the yellow-dress-wearing goddess of fertility and love, Oshun, in projects like “Lemonade” and “Black is King.”\n\n“She’s channeling Oshun, no doubt about it,” he said.\n\nThroughout the museum, Yoruba language text is displayed first and foremost, with English translations below, in a smaller font.\n\nIt was part of the mission to make an “unapologetically Yoruba” site, Oduwole said, right down to the architecture itself. Aggregates, coarse materials like sand and gravel, were used in flooring to mimic the sand floors of Yoruba villages, with reclaimed wood hung from the ceilings to hide air-conditioning units.\n\nThe very arrangement of the wood is a nod to Ifá, a Yoruba divination system that — much like binary — uses single and double lines to represent a total of 256 signs.\n\n“A priest can come and read it but if you’re not, you just look at it as a really nice abstract pattern,” Oduwole said.\n\n“So depending on your level of understanding there’s different layers of meaning as you go right through … if you’re a culture bearer, the symbolism jumps out at you immediately.”\n\nThe sloping green-roofed shape of the building, seemingly emerging from the earth, is itself a reflection of a Yoruba proverb about the circularity of life, while also paying homage to the act of ascending to Ori-Oke (“destiny at the top”) — a prayer mountain in Yorubaland of southwestern Nigeria.\n\nThe arrangement of the landscape around the Centre — which includes the restored pool and a public square — follows Yoruba principles, wherein the living quarters of a town would fan out in a hierarchy of importance from the palace and courtyard at the heart.\n\nPut all together, the Centre aims to be a beacon for a diaspora that has spread across the globe.\n\n“They can come from around the world, and they will have pride in being Yoruba and saying, ‘This is our museum, this is my culture, and I understand it,’” said Rea.', '‘A very lively place, full of color’', 'Published 4:20 AM EDT, Wed April 9, 2025', 'this-lagos-museum-is-challenging-the-traditional-eurocentric-model-1745807748'),

During the seventh-inning stretch, before the singing of “God Bless America,” Red Sox teammates and coaches kept Duran away from the area as umpires and Progressive Field security personnel gathered to handle the situation.\n\nThe fan tried to run up the aisle, but was caught by security and taken out of the stadium.\n\n“The fans just said something inappropriate. I’m just happy that the security handled it and the umpires were aware of it and they took care of it for me,” Duran said.\n\nAfter the game, the Guardians released a statement apologizing to the Red Sox and Duran. The team said it has identified the fan and is working with Major League Baseball on next steps.\n\nDuran said it was the first time he was heckled by a fan about his suicide attempt and mental health struggles since the Netflix series “The Clubhouse: A Year With the Red Sox” was released on April 8.\n\n“When you open yourself up like that, you also open yourself up to the enemies. But I have a good support staff around me, teammates, coaches. There were fans that were supporting me, so that was awesome,” he said.\n\nBoston manager Alex Cora was in the opposite corner of the Red Sox dugout but lauded security for how the incident was handled.\n\nCora was even prouder of Duran’s restraint. Duran was suspended for two games last season when he directed a homophobic slur at a heckling fan at Fenway Park when the fan shouted that Duran needed a tennis racket to hit.\n\n“There’s a two-way street. That’s something I said last year. We made a mistake last year and we learned from it. We grew up, you know, as an individual and as a group,” Cora said.\n\nThe incident dampened what had been a solid game and series for Duran. He went 4 for 6 with an RBI and had at least three hits in consecutive games for the second time in his career.\n\nIn Saturday’s doubleheader nightcap, Duran had Boston’s first straight steal of home plate in 16 years.\n\nDuran went 7 for 15 with three RBIs as Boston took two of three games in the weekend series. Six of his hits in the series came against lefties after Duran was just 3 for 31 against southpaws coming into the weekend.\n\n“I’ve been getting some good swings on lefties lately, just hitting it right at guys. I’m trying to stay with my process and it just happened to work good for me this series. So I’m just going to keep at it,” said Duran, who has hit safely in 13 of his last 14 games and is batting .323 (20 for 62) with eight extra-base hits, including a home run, and six RBIs during that span.', '', 'Published 9:12 PM EDT, Sun April 27, 2025', 'cleveland-fan-ejected-for-heckling-red-sox-star-jarren-duran-who-revealed-suicide-attempt-1745807748'),

My reaction to it, I don’t … it is what it is. I think of course it is childish. Of course, I feel like it was a childish act, but everybody does childish things here and there.”\n\nStefanski was blunter when he spoke to the media Saturday.\n\n“People are morons would be my reaction to that,” he said. “I mean, it’s sad that these young men have to deal with this.

Now these jaded millennials are sharing their wisdom with Gen Z on TikTok, posting preparation tips and no-buy lists to ease the minds of young people who could be entering their first major recession as adults.\n\nPresident Donald Trump’s whiplash-inducing policy changes have everyone warning about dire consequences for the US economy, from Fed Chair Jerome Powell to Goldman Sachs analysts. The Trump administration’s tit-for-tat escalation in the global trade war could lead to a recession for both the US and the world this year, JPMorgan said this month. It comes during an already unprecedented string of events for young people — people in their early 20s are earning less and have more debt, already battered by the Covid-19 pandemic and an onslaught of inflation.\n\nSo, the United States might not be in a recession right now, but its youngest working adults are still anxious — and seeking advice from their older peers.\n\nWhen scrolling through TikTok, Sasha Whitney, 37, noticed Gen Z users shared the same feelings over an impending recession: “downtrodden, frustrated, very bleak and hopeless about the future.”\n\nIt’s a stark difference from when Whitney graduated from college in 2009 during the Great Recession, before social media became as pervasive and when Barack Obama, who ran his campaign on the concept of hope, just took office.\n\n“When I talked to some of my millennial friends, they were like, ‘Yeah, we were broke. We were struggling,’” said Whitney, whose primary audience on TikTok is aged 18 to 25 years old. “However, we weren’t trying to keep up with the Joneses. You weren’t trying to portray a lifestyle for social media.”\n\nOther millennials joked on social media about the sense of community they had during the recession, sounding nostalgic for the days of cheaper liquor, wearing business casual and endless replays of feel-good recession pop. “If you want to know how we survived, yeah we blacked out,” one millennial user quipped on TikTok.\n\nBut millennials did share their real financial struggles. After graduating, Whitney lived at home for a bit, then moved out, paying rent and student loans and leaving $20 a week for groceries. She worked in retail immediately out of college and figured out how to handle her finances through trial and error.\n\n“I’m buying packs of tuna, frozen vegetables, bread, putting it in the freezer. That’s when it really hit me that something’s going on,” she said.\n\nWhitney’s TikTok video walked viewers through some recession tips, including: taking whatever job you can get, living below your means, and deleting payment platforms like Klarna and After Pay. Other videos from millennials on TikTok offer recession preparation guides, such has having an emergency savings fund and updated resumes.\n\n“If I can give somebody advice, especially younger folks, that’s what I’m going to do,” Whitney said.\n\nMany TikTokers are vowing to do one thing: limit their spending.\n\nFor Imani Smith, a 29-year-old in Dallas, that means password-sharing subscriptions with her friends and cutting back on going out to eat.\n\nBeauty maintenance is also a high cost, so she buys press-on nails from Amazon instead of going to the salon. Salon owners are reporting more requests for “recession blonde,” cheaper, more low-maintenance hairstyles.\n\nAnd despite the famous lipstick index — the theory that small “treat yourself” purchases uptick during economic downturns — social media users have promised to cut out small purchases like expensive lip balms and candles.\n\n“I want to (save) and build a practice of doing it before I have to do it out of basic necessity,” Smith, who described herself as in between a Gen Z and millennial, told CNN. She added that she uses TikTok, like many young people, as a search engine. In a video on TikTok, she asked viewers who were adults in 2008 whether her recession plan was good enough.\n\nWhen people sense their budgets contracting, they have to decide what they’re going to spend on, Simon Blanchard, a professor at Georgetown University’s McDonough School of Business, said to CNN. He added it may be a good time to self-reflect if you have enough emergency savings, whether we’re in a recession or not.\n\nPeople tend to cut an entire category of spending rather than a little bit of everything, so it doesn’t seem like they have to downgrade on every part of their life, Blanchard said.\n\n“And maybe those small indulgences like lipstick are the things that might be first to go because they’re just non-essential,” Blanchard said.\n\nDespite the advice from millennials to let go and live, as all the great music of the mid-2000s encouraged, anxiety still persists among many young people.\n\nAfter talking to people who lived through 2008, Smith said that “they might’ve lost their jobs, but the cost of living was so low back then that they could have picked up something retail and held themselves afloat for a while,” emphasizing her worries for the job market right now.\n\nFor many young people, their anxiety goes back to the Covid-19 pandemic.

Recession fears and a stock market sell-off that has eaten into many would-be buyers’ savings have heightened disruptions in the real estate market.', 'A few weeks ago, Los Angeles real estate agent Scott Price got the kind of call that’s only happened once before in his two-decade-long career: His buyer was backing out — just two days before closing.\n\nTo Price, the reason seemed to be a growing uneasiness with the economy. Price’s client, warned by his company that layoffs may be coming, no longer felt secure enough to make such a large purchase. Rather than take the risk, the buyer walked away from the home — and their 3% deposit.\n\n“This is not a common occurrence for me,” Price said about the transaction falling through. “It was a very unusual event.”\n\nThough deal cancellations may not be common for Price, they are happening more frequently around the US. In the four weeks between March 17 and April 13, more than 14% of all home purchase agreements in the US were canceled, according to data provided to CNN by Redfin. That’s the highest level for this time of year since 2020, when the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic froze the housing market.\n\nPresident Donald Trump’s on-again, off-again approach to tariffs this month has led economists to warn that everything from footwear to furniture may soon see price hikes, and some anticipate a recession could occur as soon as this year. But real estate agents say they may already be feeling the effects of economic uncertainty today.\n\nEven before Trump’s April 2 announcement of sweeping tariffs, homebuying in 2025 was off to a slow start. Sales of previously owned homes, which make up the vast majority of the market, dropped 5.9% in March from the prior month, according to the National Association of Realtors. That was the weakest pace of home sales in March since 2009.\n\nStill, many had hoped this year’s busy springtime homebuying season would be an improvement after the pace of national home sales nearly ground to a standstill in 2024, but recession fears and a stock market sell-off that has eaten into many would-be buyers’ savings accounts have heightened the disruptions in the real estate market.\n\n“First-time homebuyers have been a little more skittish,” Maddy Mixter, a Realtor based in Tacoma, Washington, said. “I think there is anxiety around if the markets will rebound and that makes younger buyers even more hesitant to cash out stocks right now.”\n\n“I think, for the most part, people are kind of taking a step back or being really cautious in their moves in the real estate market,” she added.\n\nEver since Trump announced his “reciprocal” tariffs on all imports to the US, later instituting a 90-day pause on many of the highest tariffs (with the exception of China), stock and bond markets have experienced massive swings.\n\nThe bond market directly affects home borrowing rates. Mortgage rates track the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield, which spiked as high as 4.5% in the weeks after Trump’s initial tariff announcement. As a result, the average rate on a standard, 30-year fixed mortgage experienced the largest one-week jump in nearly a year last week.\n\n“Mortgage rates are a huge factor, especially for first-time homebuyers who are really trying to thread the needle of affordability right now,” Mixter said. “Every tenth of a point increase is a big deal.”\n\nThose who may have been saving up to buy a new home by investing in the stock market may be disappointed by the recent performance in their portfolio: The Dow tumbled 9.1% in the first three weeks of April, the index’s worst performance for any April since 1932.\n\nAt a time when someone’s finances — or career prospects — might be in flux, Douglas Boneparth, certified financial planner and the founder of wealth management firm Bone Fide Wealth, advises waiting on making a large purchase like a new home.\n\n“It’s a case-by-case basis,” he said. “There may be individuals out there who, regardless of uncertainty, have strong savings or feel fine about their job.”\n\nFor those who plan on buying a new home in the near future, Boneparth suggests being more conservative with investments and ensuring that savings aren’t exclusively invested in stocks.\n\n“If you have a short-term goal, like buying a home in the next handful of years, the money that you need to facilitate that transaction, like a down payment, closing costs, furnishing, moving, all that stuff, that shouldn’t be fully invested in the stock market,” he said. “We need to make sure we have the resources available for that decision.”\n\nThere’s another way the Trump administration’s trade policies are already impacting the spring home market, though. Tariffs on imported construction goods and appliances have changed the calculation for buyers looking to purchase fixer-upper homes, said Matthew Bizzarro, a Realtor who works primarily in New York City and Westchester, New York.\n\n“The main talk I’ve heard about tariffs is from folks who are buying places that need to be gut-renovated,” Bizzarro said. “Some have started to feel concerned about the cost of goods to renovate and that’s creating pause.”\n\nMixter, the real estate agent in Washington, also said many of her first-time homebuyers are no longer considering homes that will require renovations.\n\n“Classically, starter homes need a little bit of shining up,” she said. “But I’ve seen a lot of first-time homebuyers that are really cautiously looking at homes that they could just move right in to… just because of the climate and the uncertainty of what’s happening moving forward.”\n\nHowever, there are some outliers. Mixter said her office has seen interest in real estate purchases among some older homeowners who recently cashed out some stock holdings amid market gyrations.\n\nFor now, they see real estate as a sound investment alternative, she said.', 'What to do if your nest egg is tied up in stocks', 'Published 9:00 AM EDT, Sun April 27, 2025', 'tariffs-and-stock-market-volatility-are-clouding-spring-home-shopping-season-1745807994'),

The Denver couple started Retuned Jewelry from their home and have seen impressive returns — averaging $360,000 in annual sales, most of which stemmed from frequenting music and art festivals.\n\nChristina, a former dental assistant, and Ian, who previously worked in information technology, handcraft donated guitar and bass strings into earrings, necklaces and bracelets.\n\n“We’ve worked 24/7 on this,” Christina told CNN. “This is our baby. We’ve pushed through burnout just to keep it alive.”\n\nBut all the hard work may fall to the wayside due to President Donald Trump’s 145% tariffs on Chinese imports, which accounted for nearly $440 billion in goods to the United States in 2024. While businesses of all sizes are impacted by tariffs, smaller operations — like Retuned Jewelry — are more exposed, according to John Arensmeyer, founder and CEO of Small Business Majority, an advocacy group that represents a network of 85,000 small businesses.\n\nHe said small businesses will have to raise prices, cut staff, delay growth plans or shut down entirely just to keep up with the rising costs of imports they can’t source domestically.\n\n“Small businesses have thinner margins and less leverage to negotiate with suppliers,” Arensmeyer told CNN.\n\nWhile the Laceys rely on free strings that otherwise would end up in landfills, the other materials they rely on — beads, chains, clasps and hooks — come from China. Ian said they’ve tried sourcing materials domestically, but those products simply aren’t made in the United States.\n\n“We’ve looked,” he said. “There’s no facility here that makes what we need.” The Laceys have already raised prices on their products ahead of the tariffs.\n\nArensmeyer said small businesses usually don’t have the cash reserves to ride out unexpected price hikes. He said the tariffs amount to a crisis for small businesses, one where “they don’t have much control.”\n\nFor the Mitchell Group — a second-generation, family-owned textile company based in Niles, Illinois — the lack of cash reserves could have serious effects during production hiccups or other problems.\n\n“Because of our business model, tariffs have put a serious strain on our cash flow,” said Ann Brunett, the company’s chief operating officer. “We typically keep goods on hand. So, I’m paying a 45% tariff — plus duty — to bring in products that might sit on a shelf until our distributors need them. That ties up our cash.”\n\nThe Mitchell Group employs 18 full-time staff and 12 sales representatives, and generates just under $10 million in annual revenue, according to its president, Bill Fisch.\n\nBrunett said the company will do “everything we can” to avoid shutting down. She said that the business “means everything to us” and that the company wants to avoid laying off their staff.\n\nFisch has explored Vietnam, India, Malaysia and even Europe as production alternatives. “No one has the infrastructure China does,” he said. “We need our coated fabrics produced under one roof and to our exacting standards. You can’t make one part in Vietnam, another in India and assemble in Thailand. It doesn’t work.”\n\nWhile Trump has touted tariffs as a way used to bolster domestic manufacturing, Arensmeyer said an increase in US production could take a long time to come into fruition.\n\n“You can’t fix that overnight,” Arensmeyer said. “You can’t just say, ‘Oh, we’re going to have a tariff, and now people are going to buy domestically,’ when we don’t have those products being made domestically.”\n\nThe textile and apparel industry has steadily declined in the United States over the past several decades, largely due to the rise of cheaper overseas production and globalization, according to Sheng Lu, a professor at the University of Delaware’s Department of Fashion and Apparel Studies.\n\nFisch said key materials the Mitchell Group uses, like specialized vinyl polymers and textiles, are virtually nonexistent in the United States. China is the world’s largest textile producer, manufacturing everything from cotton and silk to synthetic fibers and vinyl polymers.\n\nHe added that he isn’t able to find enough workers to staff a fabric factory in Mississippi.\n\n“The textile business for our kind of product?

Investors are ringing alarm bells with the assets they’re buying and mostly selling – and suddenly making comparisons to the Great Depression. And everyone from the International Monetary Fund to Trump’s billionaire friends are issuing stark warnings about his massive tariffs.\n\nHere’s what you might have missed this week.\n\nPresidential relationships can change, but Trump has taken that to an extreme.\n\nAfter calling the Fed chair (whom he appointed in 2018) “a major loser” whose “termination cannot come soon enough last week, Trump seemed to soften up on Tuesday. He said he had “no intention” of firing Powell after advisers warned that terminating the central bank chief would backfire legally and economically, sources familiar with the matter told CNN.\n\nBut the president’s outlook soured by Wednesday.\n\n“I haven’t called him. I might call him,” Trump said in an Oval Office executive action signing ceremony Wednesday evening. “I believe he’s making a mistake by not lowering interest rates, and I think, as well as we’re doing, we could do much better.”\n\nOn Wednesday, Trump said he could reimpose “reciprocal” tariffs on some countries in as soon as two or three weeks. The president had set a 90-day pause on his massive so-called reciprocal tariffs, which aren’t technically reciprocal, earlier this month to spur negotiations with other countries.\n\n“In the end, I think what’s going to happen is, we’re going to have a great deals, and by the way, if we don’t have a deal with a company or a country, we’re going to set the tariff,” Trump said in an Oval Office ceremony. “I’d say over the next couple of weeks, wouldn’t you say? I think so. Over the next two, three weeks. We’ll be setting the number.”\n\nIf he reimposes the tariffs, it would be a significant re-escalation in the global trade war.\n\nThe stock market has been on a rollercoaster this week.\n\nInvestors started with a steep Monday sell-off after Trump’s attacks on Powell. The dollar tumbled to a three-year low, and nearly every company in the Dow and the S&P 500 closed lower.\n\nShares modestly rebounded Tuesday after Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told investors that the US-China trade war is unsustainable and that he expects the battle to de-escalate, a person familiar with the matter confirmed to CNN.\n\nStocks soared on Wednesday, but Trump still has a long way to go to ease investors’ fears. Despite the two-day rally, the S&P 500 has shed $6.5 trillion in market value since its record high in February, according to Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices.\n\nMeanwhile, US crude oil has tumbled as investors fear a recession could tank demand. And US Treasury yields, which trade in opposite direction to prices, have surged in recent weeks.\n\nThe IMF released a stark warning for the global economy and US prosperity in a Tuesday report.\n\n“We are entering a new era as the global economic system that has operated for the last 80 years is being reset,” the IMF said, predicting rapidly slowing economic growth – particularly in the United States – and reignited US inflation.\n\nSouth Korea’s Customs Service also reported that exports for the first 20 days of April declined by 5.2% compared to the same period last year – a sign for where global trade is heading under Trump’s tariff agenda.\n\nBillionaires are becoming more and more vocal about the economic consequences of Trump’s tariffs.\n\nHedge fund Citadel CEO Ken Griffin, a supporter of the president, said Wednesday that tariffs are hurting America’s position in the world.\n\n“The United States was more than just a nation. It’s a brand. It’s a universal brand, whether it’s our culture, our financial strength, our military strength,” Griffin said at the Semafor World Economy Summit in Washington. “And we’re eroding that brand right now.”\n\nGriffin joins the list of wealthy business leaders diverging from the president.

The school called the closure a “very difficult decision,” but offered little explanation, in a message to the hundreds of families that it serves across two campuses.\n\nThe closure comes amid bigger shifts by CZI and its namesake leaders, and as Big Tech broadly repositions itself in the era of President Donald Trump.\n\nParents were told that the school was shuttering because CZI was withdrawing its support, according to reports from the San Francisco Standard and the New York Times. A representative for the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative told CNN that the school’s board of directors made the decision and pointed to its statement, but did not respond to an additional question about the group’s funding for the school. CZI plans to donate $50 million to the communities and families affected by the closure, the school said in its note this week.\n\nCarson Cook, the Primary School’s senior manager of strategy and advancement, confirmed in an interview with CNN that the school began meeting with parents to inform them of the closure last Thursday and said those conversations are ongoing. But he declined to comment on the reasons behind the closure or the timing.\n\n“At the Primary School, our model has always been one that carefully considers the needs of the whole family, and we want to do our absolute best to ensure that every child and their caregiver is supported,” Cook said. “And I think what we just want to say is that that hasn’t changed.”\n\nCook declined to comment on CZI. The philanthropy has recently undergone a series of significant changes. In February, the organization told employees it would cut internal and external diversity, equity and inclusion efforts.\n\nThat followed a similar move a month earlier by Zuckerberg’s company Meta — one of several Trump-friendly changes the social media giant has made since the start of this year. Zuckerberg and Chan also attended Trump’s inauguration, where they were seated prominently among other Big Tech leaders.\n\nWhen Chan and Zuckerberg founded their philanthropy initiative in 2015 — at the same time that Zuckerberg pledged to give away 99% of his Facebook fortune — they did so with four goals: personalized learning, curing diseases, connecting people and community building.\n\nThe group said it was dedicated to improving health outcomes and invested in other education projects and immigration and criminal justice reform efforts. The Primary School was among the first of those investments.\n\nIn a column for CNN the year after the Primary School’s founding, Chan wrote that the organization wanted to address “toxic stress” among children that can be caused by abuse, neglect or poverty. She said the school’s early success proved that “children and adults can build resilience and thrive even in the face of trauma.”\n\nThe Primary School had become a model for other organizations — just last month, its medical director hosted a session at the SXSW conference about how integrating early childhood education and healthcare could help “the most vulnerable children and families.” More than 95% of the school’s students are “underrepresented minorities,” the Primary School reported in a 2023 tax filing.\n\nThe school’s unique approach involved pairing parents with “parent wellness coaches,” in an effort to support not just kids, but whole families. Cook said those coaches will work directly with parents to explore other schooling options for their children after the Primary School closes next year.\n\nIn the years after the school was founded, as Meta grew and gained influence, Zuckerberg and Chan continued to speak out about social issues.\n\nIn 2017, Zuckerberg pledged to visit and meet with people in every US state — even sparking rumors that he might make a bid to challenge Trump for the White House in 2020. Then in 2020, he and Chan expressed “disgust” and called for “unity” after Trump’s inflammatory remarks about nationwide protests against racial injustice.\n\nBut Zuckerberg has since made somewhat of a political about-face.\n\nLast summer, Zuckerberg called Trump a “badass” after he survived an assassination attempt. The CEO later visited Mar-a-Lago as he angled for an “active role” in the president’s policy discussions, and he donated $1 million, through Meta, to Trump’s inauguration. Meta has also shelled out $25 million to settle the lawsuit Trump brought against the company for suspending his account after the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol — $22 million of which will help fund a forthcoming Trump presidential library.\n\nAnnouncing major policy updates ahead of Trump’s inauguration in January, Zuckerberg said the new administration represented “a real opportunity” for change at Meta.\n\nThen in February, CZI announced it would focus on science and “wind down” its investment in “social advocacy.” That included cutting work on “immigration reform, as well as our racial equity grantmaking,” it said, along with its internal DEI programs\n\nFor families at the Primary School, CZI’s abrupt decision to shut its doors marks another way tech giants like Meta have reshaped their community — and not always for the better. For years, Bay Area residents have complained that as Silicon Valley grew, the influx of highly paid tech workers created a housing shortage and priced lower-income people out of the area.\n\nOne parent told the San Francisco Standard that the school had been a “gift to the community” in the wake of the housing crisis. “Now they’re gonna take this away too,” she said.\n\nAs for the Primary School’s staff, Cook said they are focused on the year they have left with students.\n\n“We have an incredible staff and the fact that we have one more year with our families just invigorates and motivates us to provide them with the best year of school and programming that we possibly can,” he said. “Our team cares very deeply about our children, our families and about this community.”', 'Changing philanthropy focus', 'Published 5:01 PM EDT, Fri April 25, 2025', 'a-tuitionfree-school-created-by-mark-zuckerberg-and-priscilla-chan-will-shutter-next-year-1745807994'),

On Shein, CNN noted a bathing suit set cost $4.39 on Thursday; on Friday it cost $8.39, a 91% increase.\n\nThe price increases, however, weren’t consistent across the board for the basket of goods CNN tracked. In fact, a smart ring sold on Temu was about $3 cheaper on Friday than it was on Thursday.\n\nPrices fluctuate normally online so it’s not possible to know why certain prices rose and others didn’t.\n\n“Due to recent changes in global trade rules and tariffs, our operating expenses have gone up.

And, in fact, very few US taxpayers have been in recent years.\n\nLess than 1% of all returns filed between 2013 and 2021 had been audited as of the end of fiscal year 2023, according to IRS data. More specifically, only 0.44% of individual returns and 0.74% of corporate ones.\n\nThat’s partly because the agency for many years did not have a consistent level of resources — financial, human or technological — to do more. The IRS had been in the process of beefing up its enforcement efforts in the past two years thanks to funding from the Inflation Reduction Act, but a substantial amount of that funding has since been clawed back by Congress.\n\nAn audit — also known as an examination — is when the IRS asks for more information regarding what you put on your return for a given tax year. That information will then be used to validate the accuracy of the refund you claimed or the taxes you paid. If you end up owing more but fail to pay it on time — with or without an audit — you will get a collections notice.\n\nAudit rates will differ depending on factors common to select groups of filers, such as income level, credits claimed or if you own a business.\n\nFor instance, of the individual returns filed between 2013 and 2021, the IRS reported that it examined 8.7% of those filed by people who reported “total positive income of $10 million or more.”\n\nBut among those with incomes between $50,000 and $500,000, the audit rates were 0.5% or less for returns filed in each of those tax years. Audit rates were higher, however, for low-income households that claimed the earned income tax credit — with rates ranging from a low of 0.7% for tax year 2021 to a high of 1.5% in 2013.\n\nGiven the recent upheavals at the IRS, it’s not at all clear what audit rates or audit priorities may be going forward.\n\nA Treasury spokesperson declined to comment when asked what level of audits the current IRS expects to conduct.\n\nOn April 15, in a post on X, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said, “(W)e are doubly focused on making the IRS work better for American families, at a better price. To that end, we are striving for excellence in collections, privacy, and customer service.”\n\nAnd during his confirmation hearing in January, in response to questioning from Senator Ron Wyden about tax cheats, particularly wealthy ones, Bessent said, “(I)f there is some large mother lode there, then to figure out how to crack that, whether it’s through AI or some other means, that I will commit to coming back to you.”\n\nThe agency is now on its fourth acting commissioner in just three months since the January 20 resignation of Danny Werfel, who had been the Senate-confirmed IRS commissioner since March 2023. And a staff exodus is in progress through a combination of layoffs, retirements and deferred resignations. Tens of thousands of employees — including career-service staffers and leaders with tax administration expertise and institutional knowledge — are planning to leave in the coming months, or are already gone. The lion’s share of the initial staff cuts took place in enforcement — which includes both audits and collections.\n\nThe loss of staff comes as the Department of Government Efficiency is trying to speed modernization at the agency, particularly with artificial intelligence, which the IRS had started testing and using prior to this year.\n\nThe combination of more AI with a suddenly reduced workforce concerns experts familiar with audit processes, especially given what they say is the need for careful governance of audits to protect taxpayer rights while also making it possible for the agency to efficiently collect revenue owed. Such revenue is critical to the fiscal health of the United States, which has a record level of debt. As it is, the so-called “tax gap” — the difference between taxes owed and taxes paid — is already estimated at nearly $700 billion a year.\n\nWerfel said he is hopeful that the new team will make faster progress in the use of AI than previous efforts have. But he warned about the consequence of speed at all costs.\n\n“We briefed the [new administration’s] transition team when they arrived and said if you want to downsize, you can create a moonshot of significant downsizing. But if you want to avoid sliding backward on key metrics like customer service and revenue collection, you have to make sure your tech is tested and ready to go,” Werfel said. “Instead, it appears they’ve cut a lot of staff first – and now … they have to figure out the best way to serve taxpayers with staff they have.”\n\nAnd he cautions that AI can’t adequately substitute for human input and oversight in audits and collections. Not yet anyway.\n\n“We can have the computer next to us telling us which chess moves to make, but a human should confirm that the computer is reaching the right outcome before proceeding with each move on the board,” he said. “The idea that AI will take over or even supplement the audit function to make up for the loss of thousands of revenue agents? It may be possible at some point. But in the interim, there is risk of damage to the government’s financial bottom line.”\n\nFewer trained staff members may mean the agency won’t be as equipped to handle the complex audits typically associated with wealthy filers, partnerships and businesses.\n\nBut automated “correspondence audits,” which are the most typical type of audit conducted, may continue apace. Correspondence audits are done by mail and most often affect filers with simpler tax situations, including lower-income households.\n\nWith fewer people on board to manage audits, it may be harder for tax filers to reach a human being and get their cases resolved.\n\n“You have a legal right to finality and to quality customer service,” Werfel said. “You may get a letter saying you owe $300 and you’re like, ‘What? I don’t owe $300!’ You may owe the money. You may not. But while they build the AI bot that may be able to eventually help you, you can’t get through to anyone.”\n\nIf so, however, it wouldn’t be the first time filers are left hard up. In her 2020 report to Congress, National Taxpayer Advocate Erin Collins cited as one the IRS’s most serious problems the “unnecessary delays and difficulties reaching an accountable and knowledgeable contact” for taxpayers in correspondence audits.\n\nBut Nina Olson — who was Collins’ immediate predecessor and now runs the Center for Taxpayer Rights — suggested things could get worse with a heavier reliance on AI coupled with reduced staff — both at the IRS and at the Taxpayer Advocate Service (TAS), an independent entity within the IRS.\n\nEven greater taxpayer frustration: There may not be anyone – in IRS enforcement, TAS or the independent Office of Appeals – to consider many cases where a tax filer can show proof that an automatically generated default assessment by the IRS is wrong in terms of what they owe or the refund amount they’re due. In the past, Olson said, TAS has been able to help people challenge such assessments. “They go back to the IRS and say, ‘Look at this.’ And the agency says ‘You’re right. The taxpayer doesn’t owe this.’”\n\nFaulty AI models: If a filer does have a hard time getting help through normal channels, the AI model — which will identify future returns to audit in part based on prior audit case characteristics — may end up being trained on inaccurate data (i.e., the IRS’s original default assessment rather than the characteristics of audits in which a tax filer challenges an assessment and prevails).\n\nAs Olson put it at an April 15 Tax Policy Center event, cutting too many people at the IRS who can help filers address audit and collections issues “makes it more likely the machines are going to be wrong and will get false positives (in the future).”', 'Who was getting audited?', 'Published 11:57 AM EDT, Fri April 25, 2025', 'with-all-the-changes-at-the-irs-how-likely-are-you-to-be-audited-its-unclear-1745807994'),

The US consumer is clearly feeling uneasy in the current economic environment, but it’s unclear how that will translate into spending.', 'Americans are still dreading a recession and rising inflation, even after President Donald Trump paused his massive tariff hike on dozens of countries.\n\nConsumer sentiment plunged 8% in April from the prior month, to a final reading of 52.2, the University of Michigan said in its latest survey released Friday. That was a slightly smaller decline than a preliminary reading from earlier this month, which didn’t capture people’s reaction to Trump’s 90-day tariff delay announced on April 9.\n\nSentiment in April was at its fourth-lowest level on records going back to 1952.\n\n“While this month’s deterioration was particularly strong for middle-income families, expectations worsened for vast swaths of the population across age, education, income, and political affiliation,” Joanne Hsu, the survey’s director, said in a release. “Consumers perceived risks to multiple aspects of the economy, in large part due to ongoing uncertainty around trade policy and the potential for a resurgence of inflation looming ahead.”\n\nStocks briefly jumped off their lows as investors assessed the latest survey: The Dow was down 200 points, or 0.5%. The S&P 500 was down 0.15%. The Nasdaq Composite gained 0.1%.\n\nTrump’s unpredictable trade war has weighed on Americans’ attitudes toward the economy over the past few months, and now the Federal Reserve and Wall Street are watching to see if that means consumers become more cautious with their spending, or even pull back entirely.\n\nConsumer spending powers the vast majority of the US economy, so such a development would inherently mean weaker economic growth or even a recession.\n\nThe US consumer is clearly feeling uneasy, but it’s unclear how that will translate into spending.\n\nIn June 2022, when inflation reached a four-decade high, consumer sentiment reached a record low, but shoppers continued to spend in the following months. And in 2023, when there was a standoff in Congress over the debt ceiling, Americans’ economic mood soured but they still doled out on travel and concerts that year. Both economic growth and the labor market were on solid ground those years.\n\n“Sometimes the surveys are very negative, but they keep spending,” Fed Chair Jerome Powell said in remarks earlier this month.\n\nHowever, today’s economy is different from the one in 2022. The job market isn’t running at the same red-hot pace; consumers have already exhausted any savings they accumulated during the pandemic; and just this week, the Department of Education announced it will resume the collection of federal student loans in default, ending a pandemic-era pause that began roughly five years ago.\n\nThere’s also evidence that consumers became more financially strained at the end of last year, according to the New York Fed’s latest quarterly survey on household finances.\nEconomists say it’s been difficult to asses the underlying health of consumer spending because of temporary distortions to economic data, such as people front-running purchases of big-ticket items to beat Trump, tariffs, which sent retail sales surging in March.\n\nBut as long as unemployment remains low and layoffs aren’t picking up meaningfully, then spending should continue to chug along.\n\nThe lingering uncertainty over Trump’s policies is also bedeviling central bankers who set interest rate policy, affecting the costs on everything from mortgages to credit cards.\n\nTrump’s tariffs are widely expected to boost inflation, but its extent and duration is debated among economists. That’s an important element that Fed officials are considering when considering their next moves once tariffs begin to show up in the data.\n\n“We just don’t know right now with confidence: Is this a one-time effect on inflation, or is it something longer term?” Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari said Tuesday at an event in Washington. “Our job with the Fed is to make sure it is not something longer term.”\n\nOne survey-based measure that Fed policymakers care a whole lot about is people’s perception of prices, and that’s because they can be self-fulfilling. If people expect inflation to pick up and remain elevated, then they can adjust their spending accordingly. Inflation expectations in the year ahead for April were slightly lower in the University of Michigan’s final consumer sentiment report compared to the preliminary one, but they still reached their highest level since 1981.\n\nFor now, however, Fed officials have adopted a wait-and-see approach to see how the US economy ultimately responds to the administration’s slew of significant policy changes.\n\nTrump’s shock therapy has already shown up in the so-called soft data — surveys such as the University of Michigan consumer sentiment report. But there haven’t been any red flags just yet of Trump’s policies inflicting economic damage according to the “hard data,” which are figures that capture actual economic activity.\n\nMost Fed officials have said they’re keeping a close eye on any potential signs of the economic fallout from Trump’s policies, which, in addition to tariffs, also includes mass deportations and deregulation.\n\n“It is important for monetary policymakers to broadly examine all available information, including market-based measures, surveys and anecdotal reports, to understand what is happening in the economy as early as possible because, as I discussed, it takes time for policy to have an impact,” Fed Governor Adriana Kugler said Tuesday at an event in Minneapolis.', 'All eyes on spending', 'Updated 10:46 AM EDT, Fri April 25, 2025', 'consumer-sentiment-plunges-8-1745807994'),

He has also imposed 25% tariffs on steel, aluminum, autos and many items from Mexico and Canada. But by far the most significant trade action is a tariff of at least 145% on most Chinese goods imported to the United States.\n\nCombined, America’s effective tariff rate now stands at 22.8%, according to Fitch Ratings. That’s by far the highest of any developed country in the world.\n\nAs a result, trade has slowed significantly with other countries, immediately punishing importers, exporters and small businesses who have to pay the high tariffs. Trump on Wednesday in the Oval Office said trade with China has slowed to effectively zero as a result of America’s significant tariffs and China’s retaliatory levies.\n\nSoon, warehoused goods that were brought in ahead of tariffs will run out and businesses will have difficult decisions to make: import goods at more than twice the cost or stop selling them, leaving some shelves bare for consumers.\n\nMeanwhile, businesses say they are uncertain of how to invest for the future and many have stopped hiring, according to the Federal Reserve’s Beige Book — a periodic survey of American business leaders that came out Wednesday. The word “uncertainty” appeared in the report 81 times, a record.\n\nSo the reckoning for consumers is coming soon if historic tariffs remain in place.\n\nBut Trump says high tariffs will help America. In his Time interview, which took place Tuesday, Trump said tariffs will make the country rich.\n\n“The country will be making a fortune,” Trump told Time, claiming businesses will reshore production to the United States, adding jobs and investment — a theory debunked by a large number of businesses and economists. “Oh, zero would be easy, but zero, you wouldn’t have any companies coming in. They’re coming in because they don’t want to pay the tariffs.”\n\nThat plan faces extreme challenges, including training American workers who have been hesitant to take factory jobs (the United States has nearly half a million open factory jobs it can’t fill, according to the Department of Labor’s latest job openings report). Also, tariffs themselves have made factory construction significantly more expensive. And even if businesses wanted to reshore production, that process can take years.\n\nTrump, in his interview and repeatedly in public appearances, has said America is taking in billions of dollars a day from tariffs. The Treasury reports that the figure is in the hundreds of millions of dollars. Regardless, those tariffs are paid by American importers, not the target countries. Those costs are then passed down the supply chain, ultimately to consumers, who should expect to pay higher prices soon, economists argue.\n\nThat’s why consumer sentiment has plunged near an all-time low, and companies across virtually all industries are sounding the alarm bell on tariffs, pulling their forward-looking profit and sales guidance because consumers are reining in their spending.\n\nStocks sold off slightly Friday after Trump’s interview was published.\n\nHowever, Trump said his administration is rapidly constructing hundreds of deals that could improve trade fairness with foreign nations and bring manufacturing to the United States.\n\n“You have to understand, I’m dealing with all the companies, very friendly countries. We’re meeting with China. We’re doing fine with everybody. But ultimately, I’ve made all the deals,” Trump said. “I’ve made 200 deals.”\n\nThe number of deals the president and his administration says are in place or in the works is in constant flux, but Trump said in his interview that he’ll announce those deals “over the next three to four weeks.” On Wednesday, Trump said he’d announce those deals in two to three weeks.\n\nBut the deals Trump is talking about still include tariffs, taking into account non-tariff trade blockers like value added taxes, US military support and other financial arrangements with countries that the president believes are unfair.\n\n“We’re a department store, a giant department store, the biggest department store in history,” Trump told Time. “Everybody wants to come in and take from us. They’re going to come in and they’re going to pay a price for taking our treasure, for taking our jobs, for doing all of these things.”\n\nAlthough Trump in recent days has signaled that he would be open to a slight cooling off of tensions with China, in particular, he claims the impetus wasn’t the market meltdown that has wiped trillions of dollars of wealth off the value of the US stock market and sent the Treasury bond market into chaos.\n\n“The bond market was getting the yips, but I wasn’t,” Trump said. “Because I know what we have. I know what we have, but I also know we won’t have it for long if we allowed four more years of the gross incompetence.”', '', 'Updated 9:41 AM EDT, Fri April 25, 2025', 'trump-outlines-what-total-victory-looks-like-in-his-trade-war-itll-cost-you-1745807994'),

They found out about the exemptions, which have not been officially announced, on Thursday.\n\nOn April 12, China raised its reciprocal tariffs to 125% for all goods originating from the United States, in response to US President Donald Trump’s move to hike levies on Chinese goods to a sky-high 145%.\n\nFor months, Beijing has been projecting an air of strength and confidence in its ability to withstand an escalating trade war with the US. But these exemptions suggest it needs to roll back some levies on crucial items that it cannot make at home or source elsewhere. Besides semiconductors, China has decided to grant exemptions on some aircraft parts, including engines and landing gear, according to an aviation executive.\n\nSemiconductors are an indispensable part of just about every electronic device. They are difficult to make because of the high cost of development and the level of knowledge required, meaning much of the production is concentrated among a handful of suppliers.\n\nAlthough China has made strides in developing its own semiconductor industry, it is still highly dependent on imports of chips and chipmaking equipment from the United States, Taiwan, South Korea, Japan and the Netherlands. Last year, China imported $11.7 billion worth of semiconductors from the US, according to customs data.\n\nDuncan Clark, chairman of technology investment advisory firm BDA, said the exemptions suggest China does not have “autonomy in chips.”\n\n“It has ambition for that. But basically, it’s going to be a while before it can be fully autonomous,” he said.\n\nRay Wang, a Washington-based analyst focusing on US-China tech competition, said the exemptions benefit American chipmakers such as Intel, Texas Instruments and Global Foundries, which would be affected by the Chinese tariffs.\n\nChinese authorities have not confirmed the exemptions on semiconductors publicly. The General Administration of Customs and the customs offices in Shenzhen and Zhongshan, both port cities in Guangdong province, said they were not aware of the exemptions.\n\nA spokesperson for China’s Foreign Ministry said he was not familiar with the situation, when asked about the exemptions at a regular news conference Friday. CNN has reached out to the Chinese Commerce Ministry for comment.\n\nChen Shaoling, a manager at Zhengnenliang Supply Chain, an import agency, told CNN that she found out on Thursday that tariffs on eight kinds of integrated circuits, covering most semiconductors except for memory chips, had been waived to zero. The discovery was made during a routine custom clearance for her customers, she added.\n\n“We only found out after we filed the declaration — without doing that, we wouldn’t have known,” Chen said. “The news is now spreading like wildfire.”\n\nCaijing, a Chinese business magazine, reported on the exemptions on Friday, citing multiple tech companies that import semiconductors, including one based in Shanghai. The report was removed roughly three hours after it was published.\n\nThe exemptions aren’t the first time Beijing has come to the aid of its tech sector, which is starting to enjoy a closer relationship with officialdom after a years-long regulatory crackdown.\n\nEarlier this month, China removed tariffs on chips designed by American firms but manufactured outside the country. For example, US AI chip giant Nvidia’s products are largely made in Taiwan by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC).\n\nOn April 11, the state-backed China Semiconductor Industry Association said in a post on its official social media channel that the “declared country of origin” should be the location of the factory where the product was made.\n\nThat means semiconductors from American chip designers like Qualcomm and Nvidia, manufactured outside the US would not be subject to China’s 125% tariff on US goods.\n\nThis week’s exemptions appear to apply only to logic chips, which process and control data flow, an area dominated by the US. Memory chips, which store and retrieve data, are not included in the exemptions. South Korean firms Samsung and SK Hynix are the leaders in this market.\n\nThe local customs authority in Shenzhen appears to have notified some companies about the update.\n\n“Fantastic news! We have received a new notice from China Customs, stating that eight tariff codes related to semiconductors/integrated circuits are now exempt from additional tariffs on US imports,” Shenzhen HJET Supply Chain wrote in a post on its official social media account Thursday.\n\n“This means that imports originating from the United States under these codes will have their tariffs reduced to zero upon entry into China,” the post added.\n\nA staff member at the company who picked up a call from CNN confirmed the new policy, saying her company was notified by local customs on Thursday.\n\nTaihang Semiconductor, a company also based in Shenzhen that imports chips, told CNN it has received a notice from customs, though it declined to provide further details. “It’s definitely a good thing,” a staff member said when contacted by CNN.\n\nChina is granting exemptions in other sectors outside of semiconductors, including aviation, according to Olivier Andries, the chief executive of French engine maker Safran.\n\n“Yesterday night, China has decided to exempt from tax any deliveries of engines, nacelles, landing gears or parts,” he said on an earnings call Friday.\n\nThe company is a major supplier to China’s aviation industry. It makes the oxygen systems and nacelles (the structure that houses the engines and connects them to the wings) for the C919, China’s first homegrown mainline passenger plane. The C919’s LEAP-1C engines are produced by CFM, a joint venture between US engine-maker GE Aviation and Safran.\n\nAccording to Reuters, which cited an unnamed source, the Chinese government is also asking businesses to identify goods that could be eligible for exemption from its reciprocal US tariffs.\n\nThe world’s two largest economies are at each other’s throats in a bitter tariff fight that has roiled global markets, disrupted supply chains and stoked recession fears.\n\nOn April 11, Trump exempted imports of electronics such as smartphones and computers from his “reciprocal” tariffs. That exemption has had a major impact on tech giants like Apple, which make iPhones and other products in China.\n\nIn recent days, Trump has softened his tone, saying the astronomical tariffs on Chinese goods will “come down substantially” and promised to be “very nice” at the negotiating table as he attempts to get Chinese leader Xi Jinping to make the first move to initiate trade talks.\n\nBut Beijing has brushed off Trump’s apparent olive branch, demanding the US should remove all tariffs on China if it wants to talk. Chinese officials have also repeatedly refuted Trump’s claims that the two sides are in talks about trade.\n\n“There have been no negotiations between China and the United States on the issue of tariffs. The US should not mislead the public,” Guo Jiakun, a spokesperson for the Chinese Foreign Ministry, said at the regular news conference Friday.\n\nThe rebuttal came after Trump said on Thursday that his administration had meetings with Chinese officials regarding trade earlier in the morning.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional information.', 'Critical components', 'Updated 5:18 AM EDT, Fri April 25, 2025', 'china-quietly-rolls-back-retaliatory-tariffs-on-some-usmade-semiconductors-import-agencies-say-1745807994'),

Many small business owners — which employ nearly half of the US workforce — told Alicia that US-based manufacturing simply doesn’t exist for a lot of products, and hasn’t for decades.\n\nIf the tariffs hold, business owners’ options become limited: eat the added costs, try to pass the costs onto customers, or fold.\n\nFor the rest of us, the pain will come in the form of higher prices and fewer options. After years of waiting for pandemic-era inflation to ease, prices are set to surge again. In the fall, the International Monetary Fund predicted US inflation would clock in at 2% in 2025. Now, under Trump’s tariffs, the group expects inflation to hit 3%.\n\nEconomic shocks don’t hit everyone equally, or all at once. Right now, the folks closest to the lightning strike are the people running businesses. Like Busy Baby, they’re doing everything they can to keep the lights on.\n\nAfter all, it’s only been three weeks since Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariff speech, and many importers bulked up their inventories in advance to try to get ahead of the tariffs.\n\nThat front-running is winding down, according to Brendan Duke, senior director of federal budget policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, who notes that the number of vessels coming into the Port of Los Angeles this week are up 57% from a year ago.\n\nNext week, that number is projected to normalize, falling just 8% year-over-year. But the crash is just around the corner.\n\n“Two weeks from now we’re in The Bad Place,” he wrote on Bluesky, noting incoming shipments were set to fall 44% from the same week last year.\n\nBut even the “bad place” scenario won’t affect you overnight, Duke said in an interview Thursday.\n\nThat’s because it takes three to four weeks for a container ship to go from Asia to southern California, Duke said, and most of the ships arriving at the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach this week left when US businesses were still in stockpiling mode — before super-size tariffs on China were announced on April 9.\n\nIt could be several more weeks or months before customers start seeing less variety on store shelves, because retailers will draw from their stockpile before resuming imports.\n\nTrump has signaled he might take some of the heat off China, but the White House has said the 10% universal tariffs now in place aren’t up for negotiation.\n\nThose tariffs alone are still painful for American businesses and consumers.\n\n“It’s still going to increase overall prices by 3%. It’s still going to lead to an economic slowdown,” Duke said. “It’s great that you’re averting the worst scenario, but the baseline scenario is pretty horrible, too.”', 'Flashes of light', 'Published 5:00 AM EDT, Fri April 25, 2025', 'not-feeling-the-trade-war-pain-yet-get-ready-1745807994'),

Over 40% of Californian imports came from these countries, accounting for $203 billion of its more than $491 billion in total imports last year.\n\nTwelve more states sued the Trump administration Wednesday for “illegally imposing” tax hikes on Americans through tariffs in a lawsuit the White House called a “witch hunt.”', '', 'Updated 12:43 AM EDT, Fri April 25, 2025', 'california-overtakes-japan-to-become-the-worlds-fourthlargest-economy-1745807994'),

It’s a brand. It’s a universal brand, whether it’s our culture, our financial strength, our military strength …. America rose beyond just being a country,” Griffin said Wednesday at the Semafor World Economy Summit in Washington. “It was like an aspiration for most the world. And we’re eroding that brand right now.”\n\nGriffin, founder of one of the largest hedge funds in the world, said that traders are concerned about parking their investments in the United States — particularly US Treasury bonds — because Trump’s tariffs have destroyed faith that America will remain a trusted and rational actor in global financial markets.\n\n“If you think of your behavior as a consumer, how many times do you buy a product with a brand on it because you trust that brand?” Griffin said. “In the financial markets, no brand compares to the brand of the US Treasuries — the strength of the US dollar and the strength and creditworthiness of US Treasuries. No brand came close. We put that brand at risk.”\n\nTreasury bonds have historically been the ultimate safe-haven asset, backed up by the full faith and credit of the US Treasury. When the going gets tough, investors typically look to the perceived safety of Treasury bonds to park their investments while riskier and more volatile stocks take a tumble.\n\nBut that hasn’t happened in recent months. As Trump’s trade war has escalated, investors have feared that the United States could inflict significant damage to the global economy — but even more harm to its own economy and perhaps irreparable damage to its own reputation.\n\nJPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon had similar remarks in his annual shareholder letter earlier this month. Dimon said America’s “extraordinary standing” in the world was built on the strength of its economy, military and morals. But tariffs and Trump’s “America First” foreign policy could undermine the United States’ special position in the world.\n\n“America First is fine, as long as it doesn’t end up being America alone,” Dimon said. “If the Western world’s military and economic alliances were to fragment, America itself would inevitably weaken over time.”\n\nGriffin on Wednesday likened America’s brand to a famous dressmaker, a well-made handbag or a reliable automaker. But if the companies that make those brands have a public scandal, Griffin said that reputational damage can be nearly impossible to repair.\n\n“You know, you can buy like a similar dress with no name for less money, but you want the dress that you think is going to not fall apart in two weeks,” Griffin said. “It can take a very long time — a very long time — to remove the tarnish on a brand.”\n\nInvestors have turned their backs on US assets. The dollar this week hit its lowest level in three years. US crude oil has tumbled as investors fear demand could sink sharply in a recession. Treasury yields, which trade in opposite direction to prices, have surged in recent weeks. And US stocks, despite a recent two-day rally, have still erased nearly $7 trillion of market value since the stock market’s peak reached in mid-February, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices.\n\nGriffin said that shows Trump and his advisers have their work cut out for them to right the perceived wrongs of the damaging trade war.\n\n“The president and the secretary of the treasury and the secretary of commerce need to be very thoughtful that when you have a brand, you need to behave in a way that respects that brand that strengthens that brand,” Griffin said. “Because when you tarnish that brand? It can be a lifetime to repair the damage that has been done.”', '', 'Updated 12:26 AM EDT, Fri April 25, 2025', 'one-of-trumps-billionaire-supporters-has-harsh-words-for-the-president-about-his-trade-war-1745807994'),

The president added that he was informed it will be part of a longer story titled, “The Most Consequential President of this Century.”\n\nThe Trump-Goldberg interview comes less than a month after National Security Adviser Mike Waltz inadvertently added the top Atlantic editor to a Signal chat in which top defense advisers discussed a US attack on locations in Yemen. The resulting “Signalgate” scandal shocked US officials and journalists alike, intimating a significant lapse in security protocols and care on the officials’ part.\n\nAfter being added to the Signal chat, Goldberg opted to stay silent because he was unsure if the conversation was legitimate. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth then shared classified information in the group chat about a US strike on Houthi rebels in Yemen. Notably, Goldberg did not include screenshots of texts in his first report.\n\nThe Trump administration initially downplayed the scandal, insisting that the texts viewed by Goldberg did not include classified information.

It sucks!!!”\n\nThe president’s tirade appeared to be in response to Fox’s on-air coverage of its Wednesday poll, which looked at American attitudes towards Trump as he approaches 100 days in office. Fox News did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nShortly before the president posted to his social media platform, Fox News senior national correspondent Rich Edson appeared on the network’s 9 am broadcast, “America’s Newsroom,” telling co-hosts Dana Perino and Bill Hemmer that the poll shows American voters are “skeptical” of Trump’s tariff policy.\n\nDuring the same hour, Perino and Hemmer sat down with Harold Ford Jr., a co-host of “The Five,” who said that while Trump may believe the tariffs are empowering, the reality has been “angst and anxiety amongst a lot of small business, and we still don’t have trade deals yet.”\n\nIt’s not the only major poll finding that Trump’s economic approval rating has cratered. A Reuters/Ipsos poll this week found that only 37% of Americans approve of his handling of the economy, a record low for either of his terms. A new Gallup poll this week found that a record-high 53% of Americans believe their economic situation is getting worse — making it the first time since 2001 that a majority have felt that way, per Gallup.\n\nThe president’s Thursday morning post marks only the second time he’s criticized Fox News on Truth Social during his second term — this time elevating his concerns to the network’s owner.\n\nSince taking office, Trump has posted about the network more than 50 times, mostly to tout favorable coverage or his allies appearing on-air. Early last month, however, Trump personally attacked Fox’s senior White House correspondent, Jacqui Heinrich. “I thought she was absolutely terrible,” he wrote to his nearly 10 million Truth Social followers after watching her co-host a weekend show. “Not surprisingly, I later found out that she’s a fan of the White House Correspondents Association!”\n\nThe Wall Street Journal, meanwhile, has been a frequent target of Trump’s second-term ire. The president has repeatedly bashed the newspaper and its conservative-leaning editorial board for its critical coverage of his tariff policies.\n\nOver the years, Murdoch has fallen in and out of favor with the president. While Fox News has long been one of the president’s preferred news sources, Trump once called Murdoch a “piece of sh*t” after the mogul’s New York Post derided his 2024 campaign launch.\n\nMurdoch, for his part, has also waffled on his views of the president. Records obtained during the Dominion defamation lawsuit showed the media mogul’s contempt for the second-term president, succinctly summarized by Murdoch’s assertion that Trump is a “f**king idiot.”\n\nStill, that hasn’t stopped Murdoch from cozying up to Trump.

This has stoked concerns that it could similarly end up controlling the AI industry. The prominent placement of Google’s search engine on Android phones helped it achieve that monopoly status, court filings say.\n\nBut the new Razr, Razr Plus and Razr Ultra phones, which launch on May 15, are said to be the first phones with Perplexity’s AI app preinstalled – potentially pointing to a future in which Google shares more of the spotlight with its rivals. Perplexity is an AI-powered search engine and research tool that is available on the web and through an app.\n\n“It’s a big day for the future of smartphones,” Aravind Srinivas, CEO of Perplexity, said during a Motorola press event Wednesday.\n\nLike Apple (AAPL) and Samsung, Motorola is pushing AI as the major selling point of its new phones. But unlike those two companies, Motorola’s phones feature a cocktail of AI models and services from several different providers.\n\nIt’s not unusual for phone makers to partner with other service providers. For example, Apple works with OpenAI to integrate ChatGPT’s capabilities into Siri, and Samsung partners with Google to power some of the AI features on its Galaxy phones. But incorporating technology from four companies in this way is rare.\n\n“We are seeing around 30% of people at least are using four different brands in AI (on) their phones,” Maria Jose Martin, director of North American product marketing for Motorola, told CNN.\n\nMotorola’s new flip phones include AI tools that can do things like analyze what’s on a phone’s screen to provide suggestions and summarize notifications. For example, if a person is browsing Pinterest for birthday party ideas, the phone’s Next Move feature, which incorporates Perplexity’s technology, might use recommend generating an image that can be used on a party invitation.\n\nThe Razr Ultra, the most expensive phone of the trio, can trigger its AI assistant by recognizing when a user is looking at it rather than requiring a person to tap a button or say a wake word. This feature, which can be turned off, works only when the phone is partially folded and propped open.\n\nGoogle’s Gemini assistant is also included on the phone. The search giant showed at Motorola’s press event how users will be able to do things like use the AI helper to generate a podcast outlining sights to see during a vacation based on their preferences, or have Gemini search through Google Photos for a specific image.\n\nMotorola’s new phones will also have Meta’s Llama AI model integrated by default, making it the first phone maker to do so, according to Meta (META). The technology will be used to summarize phone notifications.\n\nMicrosoft’s Copilot assistant will also be included on the devices. But there’s one company that’s notably missing: OpenAI.\n\nWhen asked why tech from the maker of ChatGPT wasn’t included along with that of its biggest rivals, Allison Yi, head of Motorola’s North American product portfolio, told CNN the company looked for technology that excels in particular use cases that “complement” Motorola’s own AI. Perplexity, she says, is known for its research capabilities, while Microsoft’s Copilot specializes in boosting productivity.\n\nMotorola’s announcement comes at a critical time for both Android and the broader consumer electronics industry.\n\nGoogle was grilled in the courtroom this week during hearings meant to remedy the findings in a federal court last year that determined the company holds an illegal monopoly in search. The government proposed breaking off Android from Google or taking measures to prevent the company from giving its search engine preferential treatment on its own platforms, like Android.\n\nLee-Anne Mulholland, Google’s vice president of regulatory affairs, said in an April 20 blog post that the Department of Justice’s proposal would make it more difficult for users to access their preferred services. She called the lawsuit “a backwards-looking case at a time of intense competition and unprecedented innovation.” Google plans to appeal the decision.\n\nAt the same time, the US tech industry is grappling with high tariffs on imports, particularly those from China, where many tech products are made. That threatens to raise the prices of new products. So far, Motorola’s Razr lineup is not only priced similarly to last year’s phones but what’s considered typical for premium phones with foldable displays. The Razr Ultra costs $1,300, while the Razr Plus is priced at $1,000 and the Razr costs $700.\n\nMartin at Motorola points to the flexible supply chain of Motorola’s parent company Lenovo as a benefit in helping the phone maker navigate the uncertainty of tariffs, adding that being able to distribute phone production in different locations could minimize the impact to consumers.\n\n“What we are doing is trying to do our best to react fast to the market changes to have less impact in price positioning, or anything that could affect consumers,” she said.', '', 'Updated 1:28 PM EDT, Thu April 24, 2025', 'motorolas-iconic-flip-phone-gets-an-ai-reboot-1745807994'),

Still, the timing meant they suffered smaller losses in the value of their stock holdings than if they had sold weeks later.\n\nZuckerberg sold 1.1 million shares worth nearly $733.5 million during the first quarter.

Even after the sales, Zuckerberg owns more than 342 million shares of Meta, around 13% of the company’s total stock.\n\nThe decline in Zuckerberg’s wealth this year is particularly striking considering efforts by him and his company to foster a closer relationship with Trump, presumably in hopes that Trump’s policies and actions would benefit his company’s bottom line. That included donating to and attending the president’s inauguration, as well as a $25 million agreement to settle the lawsuit Trump brought against the company for suspending his account after the January 6, 2021, Capitol attack, $22 million of which will help fund a forthcoming Trump presidential library.\n\nCatz sold 3.8 million in Oracle shares worth $705 million in the first quarter, according to The Washington Service.

Trump backed down Tuesday from his threats to try to remove Powell from the job, telling reporters in the Oval Office: “I have no intention of firing him.”\n\nThat prompted sighs of relief on Wall Street. A day after markets boomed on comments from Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent that Trump would seek to de-escalate the trade war with China, US markets gained again on Wednesday.\n\nTop administration officials were also relieved by Trump’s Oval Office statement on Powell, the people familiar with the matter said. The officials had become unnerved by the heated rhetoric and wary of a prolonged legal battle should Trump attempt to unseat the Fed chair.\n\nThe Dow closed higher by 420 points, or 1.07%. The broader S&P 500 gained 1.67% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite rose 2.5%.\n\nThe three major indexes held on to a rally but finished well below their highest levels of the day. The Dow surged nearly 1,200 points in the morning before pulling back: Stocks came off their highest levels after Bessent cautioned that it could take considerable time to rebalance trade between the United States and China.\n\nThere is a “2 to 3-year timeline for the full rebalancing,” Bessent told a group of reporters on Wednesday after delivering a speech at an event hosted by the Institute of International Finance, a person familiar with the matter confirmed to CNN.\n\nThe comments, previously reported by Bloomberg News and CNBC, underscore how obstacles remain even as investors are eager for trade agreements and CEOs seek clarity on tariffs.\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt on Wednesday said on Fox News there will be “no unilateral reduction in tariffs against China.”\n\n“The president has made it clear China needs to make a deal with the United States of America, and we are optimistic that will happen,” Leavitt said. “And when that continues, it will be up to the president what the tariff rate on China will be.”\n\nTrump on Wednesday told reporters that his administration will get a “fair deal” with China on trade, adding more broadly that negotiations with countries “are going very well.”\n\nWhen Trump was asked in an impromptu gaggle outside the White House if he was talking to China actively, he responded: “Actively. Everything’s active.”\n\n“Every country wants to partake, even countries that have ripped us off for many, many years. China is an example, but it’s not just China, European Union. They ripped us off for many, many years, and those days are over,” he added.\n\nUS Treasury bonds initially rallied Wednesday before giving back those gains in a stark reversal. The benchmark 10-year yield fellow below 4.3% in the morning before rising back up to almost 4.39%, just below where it had settled Tuesday. Yields and prices trade in opposite directions.\n\nTrump’s notable shift in tone toward Powell and China came a day after he met privately in the Oval Office with chief executives of four major US retail companies who conveyed concerns about rising economic fallout from Trump’s tariff policy and the uncertainty it has created for financial markets.\n\nThe CEOs of Walmart, Target and Home Depot, all of whom delivered a blunt message about interruptions in the supply chain and its effects on consumers, were invited to the White House as part of an ongoing internal campaign to make the case to Trump about the real-world impact of his policies, administration officials said.\n\nTrump’s tariffs have placed significant pressure on the retail sector. The business leaders warned that store shelves across America could “soon be empty,” two people familiar with the meeting said, as they presented a dire economic picture that could come into sharper view within weeks.\n\nFor weeks, White House chief of staff Susie Wiles and other senior advisers have been fielding alarming calls from business leaders about the fallout from Trump’s tariff policies and his ongoing threats to fire the chairman of the Federal Reserve. Taken together, the president’s words have rattled markets and shaken confidence in the administration’s stewardship of the economy.\n\nBessent, who has emerged as one of the leading Cabinet officials whose words have calmed financial markets, played a key role in arranging the meeting of CEOs, officials said, as part of an effort to show Trump how serious the economic challenges facing the administration have become.\n\nDoug McMillon, the CEO of Walmart who has developed a cordial relationship with Trump through meetings at Mar-a-Lago and several mutual friends, bluntly told Trump that the trade war with China had already started to disrupt the supply chain, officials said, and would only intensify by summer.\n\nAxios first reported the fallout from the president’s meeting with CEOs.\n\nMany Trump advisers did not ultimately believe the president would attempt to fire Powell, given the warnings he’d been receiving from his economic team — including Bessent — stretching back several months.\n\nAnd Trump had seemed to absorb the notes of caution.\n\nBut his amped-up rhetoric over the past week had caused fresh uncertainty about his intentions — in particular, his message on social media Thursday that Powell’s “termination cannot come fast enough!” and his follow-up Monday calling Powell a “major loser.”\n\nTrump has argued that the Fed should cut rates soon to speed up the economy, perhaps as a way to counteract the significant economic drag that his massive tariffs are expected to create. But Powell has said repeatedly the Fed will only make a decision to raise or lower rates after careful consideration and would not rush a decision or issue an emergency rate cut before the rate-setting committee’s next scheduled meeting in May.\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt continued Trump’s line of attack Tuesday in a press briefing, in which she defended the president for criticizing the Fed. She suggested that the Fed’s action to lower rates in the late stages of the Biden administration — but not (yet) under Trump — could be political. There is no evidence the independent Fed is taking a political stance, and Powell has vehemently and repeatedly denied suggestions that the Fed plays politics when making its monetary policy decisions.\n\n“The president believes they have been making moves and taking action in the name of politics rather than the name of what’s right for the American economy,” Leavitt said prior to Trump’s Oval Office comments. “The president has the right to express his displeasure with the Fed and he has the right to say he believes interest rates should be lower.”\n\nTrump’s top economic adviser Kevin Hassett also told reporters the White House was studying whether Trump could fire Powell, and said a potential “new legal analysis” might ease market concerns. That represented a break from Hassett’s prior comments in support of the central bank’s independence.\n\nLeavitt said Tuesday that Hassett had recently changed his mind on the Fed after Powell insisted the central bank wouldn’t rush a decision to cut rates.\n\n“I also spoke to Kevin Hassett about the Fed as well and he has called into question the Fed’s independence and whether they are actually doing things out of the best interest of the economy or are they doing it for partisan reasons,” she said.\n\nBut White House officials had long determined that firing Powell would spark legal challenges and market tumult.\n\nAnd if any study was actually underway, Trump suggested Tuesday it wasn’t necessary. He said in the Oval Office he “never did” have any intention of removing Powell from the job.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional reporting.\n\nCorrection: An earlier version of this report incorrectly stated which CEOs were in attendance at a recent meeting at the White House.

Tariffs could destroy that', 'https://edition.cnn.com/2025/04/24/business/spirits-exports-2024-discus-report/index.html', 'Jordan Valinsky', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-1201561903.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_833,w_1480,c_fill', 'Barrels of bourbon are stacked in a barrel house at the Jim Beam Distillery in Kentucky.', 'Exports of American-made spirits hit a record high last year. However, a hangover is about to hit the industry as tariffs threaten to stunt growth, a leading industry group warned.\n\nExports hit a record $2.4 billion in 2024, according to the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States (DISCUS). In a report released Thursday, the trade group said that last year’s growth is thanks to a rebuilt trading relationship between the US and the European Union. Exports to the EU jumped 39% in 2024 compared to a year prior — a gain put in peril by President Donald Trump’s trade war.\n\n“Unfortunately, ongoing trade disputes unrelated to our sector have caused uncertainty, keeping many US distillers on the sidelines and curtailing sales growth,” said DISCUS President and CEO Chris Swonger in a release.\n\nAmerican-made whiskey in particular stands in the crosshairs of the trade dispute. The EU had removed tariffs on US whiskey in 2022. Since then, exports from the US to the EU have jumped nearly 60% to $699 million, according to data compiled by DISCUS.\n\nThe EU was set to levy new tariffs on American whiskey this month, but delayed them after Trump announced a 90-day pause on the so-called retaliatory tariffs against most other nations. Swonger called the pause a “positive first step toward getting the US-EU spirits sectors back to zero-for-zero tariffs and untangling spirits from these trade disputes.”\n\nEU tariffs would be a major blow for American distillers and spirits makers. The bloc is the largest export market for US-made spirits, accounting for about half of all US spirits exports, worth $1.2 billion last year, DISCUS said.\n\nBut it’s not just the EU. Canada is the second-largest recipient of US-made spirits, totaling $221 million last year. Canada’s 25% retaliatory tariff on all US spirits that began last month, and the subsequent removal of many American brands from Canadian liquor stores, is causing uncertainty in this year’s outlook with the country, DISCUS said.\n\nTariffs aren’t the only problem major spirits makers are dealing with. A decrease in demand following a pandemic-induced boom caused US exports of spirits to the rest of the world to drop by nearly 10%, DISCUS said.\n\nThat has resulted in layoffs at major distillers, such as at Woodford Reserve and Jack Daniel’s parent company Brown-Forman, and bankruptcies, including Westward Whiskey, a Diageo-backed distillery based in Oregon.\n\nDespite the recent weakness, sales of US spirits have generally grown over the past two-and-a-half decades. Exports have jumped to $2.4 billion in 2024 from $478 million in 2000.\n\nIn its report, DISCUS attributed this jump in part to the US spirits sector “having a fair and reciprocal playing field with 51 countries that have provided tariff-free access for US spirits,” including the EU, Canada and Mexico.', '', 'Published 10:00 AM EDT, Thu April 24, 2025', 'us-spirits-exports-hit-a-record-high-in-2024-tariffs-could-destroy-that-1745807994'),

Stocks fell sharply.\n\nThen US stock traders had a nice three-day weekend — the first sunny and warm spring weather New York City has seen this year — to ponder whether Trump was serious. Perhaps Thursday’s threat was just a bit of bluster from a president prone to tantrums — a one-off social media post that his more stable advisers will surely try to rein in to avoid an all-out panic.\n\nOr…not.\n\nShortly after the US stock market opened Monday morning, Trump once again attacked Powell for ostensibly not cutting interest rates fast enough. Stocks immediately tumbled and the US dollar fell to its lowest level in three years.\n\nWhile Trump’s tariff plan has been disruptive, the uncertainty it created had, to an extent, become priced in. Markets famously hate uncertainty, but the 90-day pause on the administration’s most aggressive tariffs offered a measure of reassurance that Trump may relent if there’s enough of a negative reaction.\n\nAttacking the independence of the Federal Reserve is a new level of recklessness that few thought possible. But now even Kevin Hassett, the White House adviser who literally wrote a book arguing against firing the Fed chair, is saying openly that the administration is discussing whether to do so before Powell’s term ends a year from now.\n\nTo be sure, these attacks on Powell could prove empty threats. Trump may be blowing off steam or teeing up Powell as a scapegoat for a future tariff-driven recession, said Krishna Guha, vice chairman of Evercore ISI, in a note.\n\n“But this is self-defeating,” he writes. By publicly undermining Powell, Trump “risks putting upward pressure on inflation expectations, making it harder for the Fed to cut rates.”\n\nPutting aside the very real legal question of whether Trump can actually oust a sitting Fed chair (tl;dr: it’s debatable), here’s why Trump’s renewed fixation on Powell, whom Trump himself appointed in 2017, is so concerning:\n\nThe Fed, an independent body that sets US monetary policy, is the ultimate economic safety net. It has the power to absorb big shocks — like a pandemic, say, or a recession triggered by the upending of global trade — through interest rate policy-setting and the use of its virtually unlimited balance sheet.\n\nDuring the 2022-2023 inflation crisis, the Fed raised rates at a historic pace. Undoubtedly, former President Joe Biden wasn’t pleased that mortgages, credit card rates and auto loans were suddenly surging, exacerbating America’s affordability crisis. But the Fed accomplished its mission, bringing inflation down near normal levels without plunging the economy into a recession.\n\nTake away that independence, and you take away the Fed’s ability to keep prices in check.\n\n“Fighting inflation requires being non-political and non-partisan,” said Erasmus Kersting, an economics professor at the Villanova School of Business. “Otherwise, the temptation to boost the economy for political gains is ever-present, and especially populist leaders have given in to that temptation all the time.”\n\nPresidents like when the Fed cuts rates because it spurs economic growth, but it also leads to higher inflation. Once the public, including global investors, loses faith that there’s any real will to stop it, “that inflation is almost impossible to dislodge,” Kersting added.\n\nIn other words, the Fed is a buffer against the worst effects of Trump’s economic whims.\n\nTrump wants the Fed to cut rates faster, but a big part of the reason for the Fed’s caution is Trump’s own tariff agenda, which is “highly likely to generate at least a temporary rise in inflation,” as Powell noted in a speech last week.\n\nPutting in place a Fed chair willing to take orders from Trump would undermine the credibility of the world’s most important central bank, further eroding America’s unique position as the most trusted place to park money and investments. But it could also severely hurt the economy.\n\nCutting rates fast and sharply could reignite inflation just as Trump’s tariffs slow economic growth to a crawl — the Fed’s GDPNow tool currently predicts the economy went into reverse and contracted last quarter.\n\nAny actual attempt to fire Powell, which Evercore analysts said Friday was not likely, would lead to a surge in “stagflation trades,” Guha said, referring to the nasty combo of an economy suffering from slow growth and high prices at the same time. (See also: American in the 1970s.) The resulting panic would cause bond yields to shoot higher (read: borrowing money to buy a home or car would become even more expensive), and, according to Guha, likely guarantee a recession.', '', 'Published 4:25 PM EDT, Mon April 21, 2025', 'trump-keeps-finding-new-ways-to-terrify-wall-street-1745807994'),

The diatribe came as the European Central Bank cut its benchmark interest rate and after Powell spoke last week of the potential economic consequences of Trump’s tariff agenda.\n\n“If I want him out, he’ll be out of there real fast, believe me,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office Thursday. “I’m not happy with him.”\n\nTrump on Monday continued his tirade against Powell, calling him a “major loser” in a social media post pressuring the central bank leader to lower interest rates.\n\nDirector of the National Economic Council Kevin Hassett on Friday told reporters that the Trump administration “will continue to study” the possibility of removing Powell. Hassett said he wants to look into “new legal analysis” before determining whether Trump can or should terminate Powell — a break from his previous comments stressing the Fed’s independence.\n\nWhile many experts say the president does not in fact have the power to fire the Fed chief due to policy differences, Trump has made clear he’s willing to break with norms and precedent, even in the face of potentially monumental repercussions.\n\n“I don’t think Wall Street likes the fact that the president is trying to control monetary policy, which would certainly not be a good thing over the [long term],” said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research.\n\nPowell on Wednesday said at an event in Chicago said Trump’s tariffs were unlike anything in modern history, with the potential to stoke inflation and drag on economic growth. The stark warning highlights that tariffs could complicate the Fed’s rate-cutting path.\n\nTrump, who appointed Powell during his first term, has long bickered with the Fed chair over interest rates. The Fed’s independence from politics is a hallmark of the central bank, and analysts overwhelmingly expect markets to react negatively to an attempt to fire Powell. Trump’s attack on the Fed’s independence has also raised concerns that investors might lose confidence in the stability of US markets.\n\n“President Trump’s renewed criticism of Fed Chair Powell this week is a reminder that trade policy is not the only channel through which the administration’s unconventional approach could undermine the dollar and US asset markets,” said Jonas Goltermann, senior markets economist at Capital Economics, in a Thursday note.\n\nWhen stocks slump, investors usually seek out safe havens like US government bonds and the dollar. Yet investors are selling the dollar while other safe havens, like gold, are soaring. The dollar has broadly weakened this year in a potential sign of waning confidence in the US.\n\nKrishna Guha, vice chairman at Evercore ISI, said in a Friday note that “recent market action shows a loss of confidence in Trump economic policy,” citing higher Treasury yields and a weaker dollar.\n\nAnalysts at Macquarie said in a Monday note that “flight from the USD” stems from “concerns over the Fed’s independence” and a lack of trade deal announcements, signaling that negotiations over tariffs might last many months.\n\n“The ‘test case’ of US-Japan negotiations failed to reach a deal on trade and tariffs late last week,” said Thierry Wizman, global FX and rates strategist at Macquarie. “That suggests a period of bilateral negotiations that last into July, and casts doubt about the willingness of the US and its allies to make bilateral concessions easily.”\n\nThe market on Monday was reacting negatively to Trump’s pressure on Fed Chair Powell and the lack of a trade deal announcement after the Trump administration met with officials from Japan last week, Stovall said.\n\nThe yield on the 10-year Treasury rose above 4.4% on Monday, up from Thursday. US trading was closed Friday in observance of Good Friday.\n\nThe Fed’s board of governors is scheduled to meet the first week of May to determine its next decision on its benchmark interest rate. About 88% of traders expect the Fed to hold rates steady, according to the CME FedWatch tool.\n\n“Powell reiterated that the Fed is likely to remain in wait-and-see mode as it assesses the effect of tariffs on the economy,” analysts at Morgan Stanley said in a Monday note.\n\nGold on Monday surged more than 3% and hit a fresh record high above $3,400 a troy ounce. The yellow metal has been on a tear this year as investors flock to safe havens. Gold is up about 30% this year, outpacing its gain of 27% across 2024.\n\nWall Street this week will also digest a slate of first-quarter earnings results. Investors will likely be attuned to chief executives’ guidance and forecasts for the year amid heightened tariff uncertainty.\n\nTesla (TSLA), which slumped 5.75% on Monday, is scheduled to report earnings after the bell on Tuesday. Alphabet (GOOGL), which fell 2.31% on Monday, is expected to report earnings on Thursday.\n\n“Tariffs will remain top of mind over the coming few months, yet investors are likely to refocus their short-term attention on the Q1 2025 earnings reporting period,” said CFRA Research’s Stovall in a Monday note.', 'Dollar under pressure as confidence wavers', 'Updated 4:04 PM EDT, Mon April 21, 2025', 'stocks-tumble-and-dollar-hits-threeyear-low-as-trump-bashes-powell-again-1745807994'),

And cracking down on bots is crucial as fake accounts have become more prominent everywhere from ticket sales websites to dating apps. What’s more, armies of bots can be used to spread harassment or disinformation campaigns on social media, and AI scams are already proving costly for victimized families and companies.\n\n“Every single time, for any artist around the world, tickets go live, bots go and buy tickets and they drive up the prices,” Sada said. “I’m on dating apps all the time, and probably every week I come across an account that I’m like, ‘Oh, why does this person have six fingers?’ Well, turns out it was an AI.”\n\nStill, convincing large numbers of people to let a gleaming, sci-fi-looking Orb photograph their faces to confirm their humanity and enable bot-free online spaces may be a tall order.\n\nAlready, Hong Kong has banned the project over privacy concerns. And data regulators elsewhere, including in the United Kingdom, have initiated inquiries into the Orbs; the company says Orbs are not currently available in the United Kingdom. And some critics say the Orb is part of an AI future being pushed by tech leaders like Altman that not everyone wants.\n\nBut Sada said he believes the need for the service is already apparent. “Every single website, whether it’s finance, social media, commerce, whatever, we think of proof of human is super relevant.”\n\nWhen a user scans their face with the Orb, the technology photographs their eyes and face to analyze things like dimension and how they react to light, Sada said.\n\nWhen the Orb has verified a user’s “humanness,” it sends a unique “WorldID,” to an app on their phone. The idea is that WorldID would serve as a sort of digital passport to verify users’ identities across a range of online services. It’s sort of like Face ID, but without requiring an iPhone and potentially applicable across more services.\n\nSada envisions, for example, that if a bank wanted to confirm a customer’s identity before divulging financial information, it could use your WorldID rather than security questions, which may be easier for a scammer to guess.\n\nCurrently, there are few practical use cases for WorldID. But it can be used in a limited fashion on some platforms, including Reddit and Shopify, where users can access “human-only” subreddits or retail deals, Sada said.\n\nMore than 12 million people have already verified their identity using Orbs, which are available and free to use in more than 20 countries at malls and other central locations or at Tools for Humanity events. Later this year, the company plans to roll out a service to deliver Orbs directly to people’s homes for easier verification, starting in Latin America.\n\nThe Orb is temporarily unavailable in the United States while the technology is being updated, but the company says it will re-launch “soon.” The World App is still available in the meantime.\n\nTools for Humanity built the Orb for the “World” network, an open-source platform that serves as a sort of digital hub for “verified” humans.\n\nWorld users in some countries can buy and sell the “Worldcoin” cryptocurrency, a token only accessible to people on the network. The company has gifted some Orb users a bit of Worldcoin in exchange for photographing their faces. (CNN was not offered the cryptocurrency, which is not available in the United States, when testing the device.)\n\nThe network project launched as Worldcoin in 2023, before rebranding to just “World” last year, leaving the name of the token unchanged. Leaders said the effort could help manage the “economic implications” of AI; for example, by providing a means of delivering universal basic income, an idea of which Altman is a proponent.\n\nFor now, Tools for Humanity’s main source of revenue is selling or renting Orbs to World “community operators,” who earn extra Worldcoin in exchange for onboarding new users to the network, although the company said it’s exploring additional revenue streams.\n\nAs with many other cryptocurrency projects, Worldcoin has drawn extra scrutiny to the project. Some skeptics raised concerns that offering users cryptocurrency in exchange for using the technology could encourage them to overlook potential privacy risks. Others worried the project could centralize too much power under Altman, who already has an outsized role in what’s expected to be a revolutionary tech transformation.\n\nLast fall’s rebrand was viewed as a likely effort to expand its identity beyond the original cryptocurrency effort.\n\nSada says Tools for Humanity says Worldcoin gives users ownership over the World network. Tools for Humanity did not respond to a request for comment on behalf of Altman, its chairman.\n\nThe Orb also faces ongoing scrutiny from privacy regulators in Europe and elsewhere, given that it uses sensitive biometric data to verify users’ humanity.\n\nAccording to Tools for Humanity, photos taken by the Orb are sent to users’ phones along with their WorldID and then are automatically deleted from the device, so the company retains no biometric data. The data is encrypted en route to users’ devices, where users can set up the app to require authentication before opening it. The company has also open-sourced much of the technology behind the Orb, an effort, it says, to allow third parties to verify its safety claims.\n\n“It’s not very intuitive that something like this is … private,” Sada said. “We think that privacy is freedom, and something like World exists first and foremost to defend people’s freedom.”\n\nCorrection: A previous version of this story misstated where Orbs have been banned.

Its lawyers that represented the company throughout the FTC investigation, including former FTC chair Tim Muris and former FTC commissioner Christine Wilson, called it a “rushed investigative process” and said the complaint was based on “misunderstandings.”\n\n“We are disappointed that the FTC chose to move forward with this action, but are confident that the courts will agree with what we already know: Uber One’s sign-up and cancellation processes are clear, simple, and follow the letter and spirit of the law. Uber does not sign up or charge consumers without their consent, and cancellations can now be done anytime in-app and take most people 20 seconds or less,” the company said in a statement.\n\nThe FTC alleged Uber also “failed to deliver promised savings” for the Uber One subscription. Though customers were promised savings of $25 a month, “Uber does not account for the cost of the subscription (up to $9.99/month) when calculating those savings,” the agency said in the press release.\n\nCustomers were also allegedly enrolled without their consent and were charged before the billing date. The lawsuit used an example of customers who said they signed up for a free trial and were then automatically charged before the free trial even ended.\n\nAnd when it came to cancelling, the FTC said, users were forced to click through up to 23 screens and take 32 actions to cancel.\n\n“Some users are told they have to contact customer support to cancel but are given no way to contact them; others claim that Uber charged them for another billing cycle after they requested cancellation and were waiting to hear back from customer support,” the press release said.\n\nThe suit was filed in the US District Court for the Northern District of California and alleges Uber violated the FTC Act and the Restore Online Shoppers’ Confidence Act.\n\nThe suit is one of the first major actions against Big Tech spearheaded by Ferguson’s FTC under the Trump administration. Like many leaders in the industry, Uber and its CEO Dara Khosrowshahi each donated $1 million, respectively, to Trump’s inaugural fund.\n\nAn antitrust suit brought by the FTC against Meta’s acquisition of Instagram and WhatsApp is also underway, though that lawsuit was filed before Trump took office.', '', 'Updated 3:14 PM EDT, Mon April 21, 2025', 'ftc-sues-uber-alleging-deceptive-uber-one-charges-and-cancellations-1745807994'),

In the end, it will achieve nothing and harm both others and oneself,” the spokesperson said in a statement.\n\n“China firmly opposes any party reaching a deal at the expense of China’s interests. If such a situation arises, China will not accept it and will resolutely take reciprocal countermeasures,” the spokesperson added.\n\nThe stern warning comes on the heels of Chinese leader Xi Jinping’s charm offensive in Southeast Asia, where he presented China as a reliable partner and staunch defender of global trade – in stark contrast to the tariff whiplash and policy uncertainty of the Trump administration.\n\nPressure has been piling on countries and businesses alike as they try to thread the needle between the two economic superpowers, which have slapped record tariffs on each other in a swiftly escalating fight that has roiled global markets, disrupted supply chains and stoked recession fears.\n\nOn April 9, Trump paused his “reciprocal” tariffs on most nations for 90 days while narrowing the focus of his historic trade war squarely on China, hiking levies on Chinese imports to a staggering 145%. Many countries are hoping to renegotiate the levies with the US before the suspension expires.\n\nIn response, China retaliated by raising tariffs on US goods to 125% and adding more American companies on its export control list and unreliable entity list. Beijing also moved to exert pain on key US industries, restricting the number of Hollywood movies shown in the country and returning at least two Boeing jets intended for use by Chinese airlines to the US.\n\nWith the US and China at each other’s throats on tariffs, neither leader is backing down – and both are looking to build a broad coalition of countries against the other.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported last week that the Trump administration planned to use ongoing tariff negotiations to pressure US trading partners to limit their dealings with China, citing unnamed sources with knowledge of the conversations.\n\nThe idea is to extract commitments from US trading partners to isolate China’s economy in exchange for reductions in trade and tariff barriers imposed by the White House, including asking nations to disallow China to ship goods through their countries, prevent Chinese firms from setting up in their territories to avoid US tariffs and not absorb China’s cheap industrial goods into their economies, the WSJ reported.\n\nFor its part, China has sought to capitalize on the chaos and uncertainty unleashed by Trump and rally countries to its side.\n\nIn his first foreign trip this year, Xi visited Vietnam, Malaysia and Cambodia last week, signing a barrage of bilateral cooperation agreements and pledging to uphold free and open trade. The three export-reliant economies were hit by US “reciprocal” tariffs of up to 49% before the levies were paused.\n\nChinese officials have also held calls and talks with counterparts in Japan, South Korea and the European Union to push for closer economic cooperation.\n\nBut while countries appear receptive to Beijing’s outreach, they are also wary of being flooded with cheap Chinese goods that are now shut out of the US markets due to the sky-high tariffs – and the risk of provoking Trump for siding with China. Beijing’s own record of economic coercion, aggressive trade practices and assertive military posturing in the region is not helping, either.\n\nElizabeth Economy, a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University, said despite China’s overtures, countries are not “jumping at the chance to partner with China.”\n\n“For many of these countries, even when China is a larger trading partner, the United States is often a much larger export market. So they have significant stakes with the US economy as well,” she said.\n\nAnd even as Xi launches his charm offensive, Beijing is not stopping its military assertiveness in the region, Economy added, citing Chinese live-fire drills in waters near Australia and New Zealand in February, ongoing aggression against Taiwan, the Philippines in the South China Sea and Japan over the Senkaku Islands in the East China Sea.\n\n“They’re not stepping back in terms of their security ambitions even as they’re trying to promote themselves as a stabilizing economic force. So I think that charm offensive needs to be more all-embracing if Xi Jinping is actually going to realize the kinds of benefits that I think he wants from what President Trump is doing,” she said.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional information.', '', 'Updated 2:48 AM EDT, Mon April 21, 2025', 'beijing-warns-countries-against-colluding-with-us-to-restrict-trade-with-china-1745807994'),

Trade war?', 'https://edition.cnn.com/2025/04/20/business/chicken-tax-auto-tariffs/index.html', 'Chris Isidore', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-1558411318.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_833,w_1480,c_fill', 'A man guides a Herrmatic Cage Feeder, an electrically-powered device assisting with the feeding of chickens on a poultry farm, in the United States, circa 1965.', 'It’s called a chicken tax, but it’s levied on pickups. And it shows just why President Donald Trump’s tariffs could change the US economy longer than you might think.\n\nPresident Lyndon Johnson imposed the chicken tax in 1963, but it’s still in effect today, even though its supposed reason for existence is, well, no longer in existence.\n\nThe import tax’s longevity, though, underscores how tariffs can reshape global markets, sometimes well past the conditions they were put in place to address. Trump’s trade war could change the way Americans and the world shops and buys for generations to come.\n\nTo this day, the chicken tax essentially prevents automakers from selling pickup trucks made in Europe or Asia in America. Most US pickups are built in North America, leading to massive profits for US automakers but less choice and higher prices for millions of American buyers, as well as some impressively convoluted maneuvers by automakers to try to get around the tax.\n\n“Trump seems to think he can announce very high tariffs and then them dial back. But tariffs changes economic incentives,” said Dan Ikenson, an economist and former director of international trade at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank. “Constituencies develop and they take on a life of their own, and that’s why they’re long lived.”\n\nThe chicken tax started, unsurprisingly, with chickens.\n\nIn 1962, European countries tariffed American chicken, practically shutting US poultry producers out of the lucrative and growing market in Europe.\n\nSoon after Johnson took office in 1963, he imposed “retaliatory” tariffs on a number of European products, including trucks. At the time, only a sliver of US car sales were imports and few Americans had even heard of Toyota or Honda.\n\nThe 25% tariffs on “motor vehicles for the transport of goods” was primarily to punish German automaker Volkswagen, which was the only foreign automaker making inroads into the US market at that time. There were also US tariffs on potato starch, dextrin and brandy, three other products important to European exporters. But the American beneficiaries of those tariffs didn’t have nearly the political clout as the auto industry, Ikenson said.\n\nBy cutting out foreign competition, the chicken tax opened the door for America’s “Big Three” automakers, General Motors, Ford and Chrysler, to raise prices on their trucks. Prices of American built trucks, though not subject to the tariffs, rose about 5% to 6% a year while car prices rose only 2% a year, according to preliminary analysis of car and truck prices by Jonathan Smoke, chief economist at Cox Automotive.\n\nBigger profits meant US automakers focused more on producing trucks. So even when Europe dropped the tax on American chickens in 1964, the Big Three and the auto workers union flexed their considerable muscle to keep the imports on foreign trucks in place, Smoke said.\n\n“It was never challenged or questioned politically,” said Smoke.\n\nFew, if any, truck buyers realize the tax meant they were paying higher prices, Smoke added. And since it spurred American production, “the average American would say this isn’t a bad thing.”\n\nThe chicken tax even survived numerous rounds of global trade agreements aimed at promoting free trade, including the creation of the World Trade Organization in 1995.\n\nThat’s because once the tariffs are in place, they tend to stay in place, says Lawrence Friedman, a global trade attorney. For example, there are still tariffs on televisions with cathode ray tubes – the big, bulky kind that have fallen out of favor in place of flatscreens – and ones with built-in VCR players.\n\nBut with trade restrictions comes the search for loopholes.\n\nSuch practices are common in the complex world of trade rules and tariffs, said Friedman. The term in the trade industry is “tariff engineering.”\n\nTo get around the chicken tax, some foreign automakers shipped trucks to the United States without the truck beds attached to the chassis. Others added extra seats so that the trucks were classified as passenger vehicles. The Subaru BRAT added two rear facing seats in its truck bed.\n\nAnd it wasn’t only the foreign automakers who played games to avoid the chicken tax. Between 2009 and 2013, Ford, which was building the Transit Connect van in Europe, shipped them to the US with additional seats that would be removed once they cleared customs. The Department of Justice eventually fined Ford $365 million in 2024 over the issue.\n\nHowever, it was the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA, that really opened a legal route around the chicken tax.\n\nNAFTA opened the trade borders with Canada and Mexico, so automakers were soon building trucks destined for the US market both north and south of the border. General Motors, for example, builds its best-selling truck, the Silverado, in Canada and Mexico as well as the United States.\n\nWith pickup imports taxed, many Asian and European automakers turned to a different (less-tariffed) niche: cars. Especially smaller, more fuel-efficient economy cars.\n\nThe timing was on their side. With gas prices rising in the early 1970s, Americans flocked to those kinds of autos. When foreign brands began building US plants, starting with a Honda plant in Ohio in 1982, they concentrated first on cars, not trucks.\n\nHowever, foreign brands didn’t build US factories because of the chicken tax, but because it was cheaper to build closer to where the cars would ultimately be sold.\n\n“The tariff is not that much of an inducer of foreign direct investment the way we thought,” said Ikenson. “There was a ton of investment coming in to produce cars, and the tariff on them was only 2.5%.”\n\nEven with the combination of shutting out foreign pickups and Americans’ love of trucks, the Big Three’s overall share of the US auto market has continued to shrink these last 60 years.\n\nBy 2007, Asian and European brands captured a majority of US combined car and truck sales over the traditional Big Three automakers for the first time, according to companies’ sales reports.\n\nThough the Big Three still dominate truck sales, they now only account for 38% of overall US auto sales, producing fewer vehicles at their US plants last year – 4.6 million – than the 4.9 million built by foreign automakers, according to data from S&P Global Mobility.\n\nHow Trump’s tariffs change the market, and how long they stay, is tough to say, said Cox Automotive’s Smoke.\n\nBut however long they last, the chicken tax shows that undoing tariffs is never that simple. And even when tariffs raise car prices and cost more auto jobs than they create, the idea behind them is a powerful narrative, Smoke said.\n\n“I wouldn’t be surprised that this one example of tariff that Americans end up supporting,” he said.', 'A trade war older than most Americans', 'Published 11:00 AM EDT, Sun April 20, 2025', 'chickens-pickup-trucks-trade-war-1745807994'),

If you\'re still trying to get your return in under the wire, having all your tax documents in order can make that easier. But if that\'s not possible, at least file for an automatic extension and pay whatever else you owe the IRS for 2024 by Tuesday night.', 'It’s April 15 — otherwise known as “Tax Day” in the United States.\n\nWhile the IRS has already received a majority of the 2024 federal income tax returns typically filed by Tax Day — 101.422 million as of April 4, to be precise — US tax filers are expected to send in tens of millions more by today.\n\nBut the agency also expects to receive millions more returns in the months ahead due to the automatic extensions the IRS granted to people in federally declared disaster areas. At current count, all residents and businesses in seven states have already been granted filing and payment extensions, on top of people in select areas of other states. More on that below.\n\nPlus, millions of individual filers have requested — or will request today — automatic six-month filing extensions because they won’t make the April 15 deadline.\n\nIf you are racing to file your return today — or think you won’t make it in time — here are some last-minute tips to keep in mind.\n\nIf you’re starting cold, make sure you pull together all the documents you’ll need to fill out your return. You’ll want to look for income reporting forms from your employer (a W-2 for your earnings) or from your clients if you’re self-employed as a freelancer or contractor (a 1099-NEC or 1099-MISC).\n\nYou may even get a 1099-K from any payment apps you use like Venmo if you received payments for your goods or services. If you are receiving any income distributions from an IRA or pension, you should have a 1099-R.\n\nAlso look for other 1099 forms from your bank and brokerage for other types of income you received during the year (e.g., interest, dividends and capital gains).\n\nAll these forms will have been sent to you by mail, electronically or both.\n\nConsider, too, any major changes that took place in your life in 2024 that could affect your taxes either through new tax breaks or new types of reportable income — for instance, if you got married, had children, received alimony, started a small business on the side, bought or sold a home, inherited an IRA or collected unemployment benefits.\n\nMost filers now take the standard deduction — a flat amount you deduct from your income ($14,600 for single filers and those who are married filing separately; $29,200 for married couples filing jointly; and $21,900 for head-of-household filers).\n\nBut if the standard deduction amounts to less than the total of the value of itemized deductions you’re eligible to take (e.g., state and local taxes, mortgage interest, charitable contributions, etc.) you might want to itemize.\n\nIf you do, gather the documentation you will need to back up those deductions (e.g. a Form 1098 for mortgage interest from your lender, contribution receipts from charities, etc.).\n\nSpeaking of deductions, if you qualify to deduct contributions to a traditional tax-deferred IRA, you can put away up to $7,000 ($8,000 if you’re 50 or older) by 11:59 pm on April 15 and still have it count as your 2024 contribution.\n\nSince it’s an “above-the-line deduction” you’re allowed to take it even if you claim the standard deduction. Here are the eligibility rules if you have a retirement plan at work and if you don’t.\n\nIf you have a fairly straightforward tax situation with a household income below $250,000, and if you take the standard deduction and only a handful of credits pertaining mostly to family, you may be eligible to use the IRS’ free Direct File program. (Here’s how to figure out if it would be right for you.)\n\nThe Direct File option is currently available in 25 states: Alaska, Arizona, California, Connecticut, Florida, Idaho, Illinois, Kansas, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Jersey, New Hampshire, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Washington State, Wisconsin and Wyoming.\n\nThe program works on mobile phones, laptops, tablets or desktop computers. And it will help guide you to fill out your state tax return, too.\n\nYou also can file for free using one of several private-sector tax preparation software programs approved by the IRS. These free filing options, however, are for those with adjusted gross incomes of $84,000 or less. Other eligibility criteria may apply.\n\nWhether you’re preparing your return on your own, working with a tax preparer or using Direct File, you always want to double check that everything is correct on your return before submitting it. Dopey little mistakes — getting a number wrong, misspelling your name, selecting the wrong filing status, etc. — can hold up the processing of your return. And if you’re due a refund, those errors could delay that money getting to you.\n\nIf possible, electronically file your return, which is generally considered to be safer and faster, according to the Taxpayer Advocate Service.\n\nWhile April 15 is the deadline for most US tax filers, there are certain groups of filers whose official due date is later this year, such as people living and working in certain federally declared disaster areas. This now includes all the residents and businesses operating in seven states: Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina and Tennessee. It also includes some US citizens living abroad; and military members stationed outside the US or in a combat zone.\n\nBut if you’re not among any of those groups and you really can’t file your taxes today, do these three things before 11:59 p.m. local time tonight:\n\n1. File for an automatic six-month filing extension here.\n\n2. If you think you still owe money to the IRS for tax year 2024, it must be paid by Tuesday, even if you request a filing extension. One way to ballpark whether you still do is to multiply your 2024 income by 20% and make sure that you have already paid that much, according to Tom O’Saben, director of tax content at the National Association of Tax Professionals. If you haven’t, send the IRS the difference.\n\n3. Send that payment no later than 11:59 pm tonight. If you’re mailing it, do so by certified mail, so you’ll have confirmation that it was sent and received. If you can’t pay all that you owe, pay however much you can by April 15, then explore the various payment agreements you can make with the IRS.\n\nIf you don’t file and haven’t requested an extension — or if you don’t pay the rest of what you owe the IRS for 2024 today — you may be subject to a failure-to-file penalty equal to 5% of the balance you owe plus interest for every month you don’t file; and/or a failure-to-pay penalty equal to to 0.5% of what you owe plus interest every month until you pay in full.', 'Get all your documents in order', 'Updated 9:23 AM EDT, Tue April 15, 2025', 'its-tax-day-still-havent-filed-tips-on-how-to-get-an-extension-and-more-1745807994'),

(That excludes people working as farmers, nonprofit or private household employees, and more.)\n\nThere are about 6.8 million people who currently want a job — so here’s what you should do before, during and after an interview to stand out and get the job you want.\n\nBefore you get an interview, you need to stand out from hundreds of other applicants, and you have about six seconds to catch a recruiter’s eye using your resume, Haller said. Therefore, your resume should be one compelling, clear and uncrowded page that is tailored to the position and highlights why you’re the best candidate.\n\nBe careful who you get advice from, Haller said. If you know other people who work at the company or in similar industries, consulting them could be good. Parents and other people their age, however, likely have good intentions but may have not interviewed for a job in decades or ever worked in your industry, and the workforce is different now.\n\nUnless you’ve gone to a specialty school, your college or graduate school career center may not have employees with any experience in hiring people, so it’s not always helpful, Haller said. Look the career center employees up online to see if they have a relevant track record.\n\nDo your research\n\nOne of the biggest mistakes some interviewees make is asking questions about things they could have easily found by looking at just the homepage of a company’s website, said Dr. Nicolas Roulin, professor of industrial/organizational psychology at Saint Mary’s University in Canada. That, as well as not asking any questions at all, tells the interviewer you haven’t done your homework and probably don’t care about the job.\n\nThoroughly research the company, experts said. You must be able to answer the question, “Why do you want to work here?” and express how you can contribute to the company’s values, culture, strategies, goals and more.\n\nBy researching the interviewers, as well — if you have their names — you can ask them more in-depth questions about their job, goals and lives, and you may even find you have a fun personal connection to bring up, such as having attended the same school.\n\nWebsites such as LinkedIn or Glassdoor can help you find some of this information. Glassdoor reviews are typically left by current or former employees.\n\nWrite down your answers in advance\n\nDuring the interview, you’ll also need to demonstrate how well you fit, and can perform, the job description.\n\nYou can prepare by writing down your success stories for each requirement within that description, using the STAR technique. That acronym stands for situation, task, action and result — define the situation, what task needed to be accomplished, what actions you took alone or as part of a team to do so, and what the results were.\n\nPrepare your questions\n\nYour questions are just as important as your answers, and they should show interest, motivation and care, as well as what’s important to you, experts said. Here are some examples, which you can practice on your own or in mock interviews with friends or family:\n\nIf you struggle with nervousness before interviews, relaxation or breathing techniques can help, Roulin said. Experiencing more severe anxiety may require therapy.\n\nDressing professionally for both in-person and virtual interviews is important regardless of whether it’s for a fast-food restaurant, retail store or office job, experts said. Business casual is usually best — no jeans, shorts, flip-flops or overly revealing clothing.\n\nIf the company culture is more casual, that doesn’t automatically mean you should dress like them for your interview, Haller said. Those employees have already had the chance to show over time that they do great work despite how they’re dressed, but they don’t know you yet. You need to make a good impression that shows you’re respectful and serious.\n\nAt the same time, don’t go overboard by wearing a three-piece suit and appearing totally out of touch, Haller said — unless that’s the dress code.\n\nBring all those notes you prepared to the interview, but don’t bring your parents. That can imply immaturity and incapability, and you’re the one who needs to be able to do the job without them.\n\nWhere you do the interview is also important. The setting should be as distraction- and noise-free as possible, so avoid conducting it from a public space, such as a coffeeshop. Turning your camera off is generally inappropriate, experts said, and it can suggest you’re hiding something or uncomfortable dealing with people — which is obviously a concerning red flag since most jobs require dealing with people.\n\nREAD MORE: Life lessons from 6 money and lifestyle coaches\n\nIf you don’t have an answer for a question, ask the interviewer to rephrase or say “I don’t have much experience with that particular issue, but I can tell you about a time when X.” You can also say you would like an opportunity to really think about the question if they would let you get back to them with an answer. These alternatives show you’re adaptable, and they allow you to show off in other ways.\n\nWhen you’re given the chance to ask questions, ask what you’ve prepared. But save questions about salary, availability expectations and vacation benefits for a point towards the end of the interview, Mondragon said. These questions are important for your survival and quality of life, something Gen Z cares more about than previous generations — which is a great thing, he added. Some states, such as Colorado and New York, have even required that job postings state the salary. But you don’t want to appear to care more about not working than working.\n\nHow you ask also matters. “Can you tell me about the company’s benefits packages for employees at this level?” sounds better than “How many days off do I get?”\n\nAt the end, ask if there’s anything else you could provide to show you’re a great candidate for the position, Haller said. “You want to overcome any objections. And then you always want to ask about the next steps and express your interest.”\n\nWithin 24 hours after the interview, email a thank you note expressing gratitude for the interviewer’s time and the opportunity, Haller said. But know that your message is more than a thank you note — it’s also an indirect reminder to hire you.\n\nIf you get a call for another interview or a job offer, respond as immediately as possible, experts said. Even if you’re no longer interested, you should still quickly communicate that, too — it’s the respectful thing to do, and you don’t want to burn any bridges you may need to cross again in the future.\n\nDo not follow up with an employer about whether there’s any news before the time they said they’ll be in touch, Roulin said. After that is when you can check in once a week. If a month or two go by, no response from them is your answer, Haller said — and you shouldn’t work for companies that treat people that way.\n\nFor more resources on creating resumes and interviewing well, you can visit the United Kingdom’s National Career Services site, Glassdoor and ResumeBuilder.', '', 'Updated 1:20 PM EDT, Fri October 4, 2024', 'not-using-these-job-interview-tips-can-reduce-your-chances-of-getting-that-job-1745807994'),

But in some cases, those effects — positive or negative — may not be as large as you think.', 'Over the past couple of years, the Federal Reserve aggressively raised its key interest rate to a 23-year high to beat down inflation. Now that inflation has slowed substantially and is expected to cool further, the central bank is expected to embark on a rate-cutting campaign over the next two years, starting as early as September.\n\nIf it does, rates should decline on a wide swath of financial products for Americans, from credit cards and home loans to bank accounts and certificates of deposit, among others.\n\nGiven how many ways lower rates can affect your finances, here are some things to consider when deciding what steps to take in response.\n\nThe prospect of lower borrowing costs will be welcome news to those seeking loans or anyone trying to reduce their existing debt loads. But, realistically, how much you’ll save when the Fed lowers rates will depend on how quickly it cuts and by how much each time. The answer for the near term is most likely to be “not that much.”\n\n“Interest rates took the elevator going up, but they will take the stairs coming down,” said Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate.\n\nBy that he means: “Rates are not going to fall fast enough to bail you out of a bad situation [this year],” McBride said. “And for savers, [the initial declines] won’t wipe out your interest earnings. Savers will still be way ahead of the game.”\n\nThat’s because one or even two quarter-point rate cuts this year won’t meaningfully reduce many of your interest costs. But several cuts over the next year or two could make a noticeable difference, and it may be worth holding your fire on some moves until then.\n\n“Don’t jump the gun too early on this stuff,” said Chris Diodato, a fee-only certified financial planner and founder of WELLth Financial Planning.\n\nHere’s a breakdown of how lower rates may affect key areas of your financial life, along with tips from Diodato and McBride on what to do about it.\n\nGetting a mortgage is one of the biggest financial moves most people ever make. Mortgage rates are influenced by a number of economic factors, and the Fed’s moves are one. Since loan amounts are substantial, this is one area where even small cuts in interest rates could make a meaningful difference in what a homebuyer will pay.\n\nFor those buying a home this year, you may be tempted to buy down points to reduce your mortgage rate. Before doing so, Diodato advised, crunch some numbers to make sure it will actually save you money if you think you may be tempted to refinance in a year or two should rates drop further. That’s because you will pay thousands of dollars to buy down your mortgage rate now, and then thousands more in fees to refinance.\n\nTo buy down a quarter of a point might cost you 1% of your loan or 4% for a full point, he said. To refi, the costs could be higher — they typically run between 2% and 6% of your loan, according to Lending Tree.\n\nGiven that mortgage rates have fallen at least 1.25% in every rate-cutting cycle since 1971, and often over 2% or 3%, Diodato sees it this way: “Buying your rate down a quarter of a percentage point, or even a full percentage point, wouldn’t stop most people from wanting to refinance at some point during the next rate-cut cycle. So, my rationale is not to saddle folks with both paying for points and then the costs of a refinance.”\n\nAs for taking out a home equity line of credit, be aware that it’s no longer cheap money to borrow: The current average rate range for HELOCs is roughly 9% to 11%. A couple of quarter-point rate cuts from the Fed won’t make it meaningfully cheaper, McBride said. “Americans are sitting on more equity than ever, but you have to be judicious about how you tap into it, given how much it costs to borrow against it. Just because you have equity doesn’t make it free money.”\n\nOf course, if you’re just taking out a HELOC to serve as an emergency lifeline and you never tap it, the rate may be less of a concern. But it still may cost you money by way of closing costs, any requirement that you withdraw a minimum amount at closing, or any other ancillary fees for having the line, such as an annual fee or inactivity fee, McBride noted.\n\nAnd if you already owe money on a HELOC, he suggested, “aggressively pay it down. It’s high-cost debt that won’t get cheaper soon.”\n\nAnother perpetually high-cost form of debt is your unpaid credit card balances. A few rate cuts won’t make much of a dent in today’s record-high average rate of 20.7%. Even if rate cuts ultimately push down the average to where it was at the start of 2022 — 16.3% — it will still be a pricey loan.\n\nThat’s why, if you’re carrying credit card debt, the advice is the same as it has always been: If you qualify, sign up for a zero-rate balance transfer card that can buy you at least 12 to 18 months interest free so you can meaningfully pay down the principal you owe.\n\nIf that proves difficult to get, see if you can transfer your balance to a credit card from a credit union or local bank that offers lower rates than the biggest banks. “They typically have fewer perks, but their rates can be half as high,” Dodiato said.\n\nIf you want to finance the purchase of a new car, a rate-cutting environment may not help as much as you think. McBride notes that every quarter point cut knocks $4 a month off a typical loan for a $35,000 car. So a full percentage point drop amounts to just $16 a month, or less than $200 a year.\n\n“Your real lever for savings is the price of the car you choose, how much you’re financing and your credit rating,” he said.\n\nAs for leasing a car, McBride noted, the effect of a Fed rate cut may be equally small on the so-called “money factor” you will pay to lease, and because many variables determine what that factor will be, it will be hard to figure out the impact of lower interest rates.\n\nThe past year has been very good for anyone who parked cash in online high-yield savings accounts, many of which have been paying north of 5%. The same goes for those who could lock up their cash for certain periods of time in certificates of deposits or Treasuries, many durations of which were also paying north of 5%.\n\nWhile those rates will start to come down when the Fed starts cutting rates, the drops aren’t likely to be huge at first — meaning you will still be able to earn more on your savings than the rate of inflation for a while, McBride predicts.\n\nBut it may no longer make sense to leave quite as much cash in these types of vehicles going forward. “I caution people against the cash trap. A lot of people, used to these nice savings rates, were diverting money from stocks and longer-term bonds,” said Diodato, who predicts yields on savings will eventually fall to 3% in the next two years.\n\nHis advice: Don’t keep more than six months’ to a year’s worth of living expenses in cash or cash equivalents. “Anything more than that and you’re putting a drag on your future net worth,” he said.\n\nThat said, McBride suggested that if you’re within five years of retirement, you might want to lock in some high rates still on offer today to grow the cash you’ll want to cover living expenses in the first few years after you stop working. Having that cash on hand means you won’t be forced to pull from your longer-term portfolio should there be a big market downturn at the start of your retirement.\n\nFor instance, many CDs with durations of two, three, four or five years are currently paying between 4.85% and 5% on Schwab.com. If you do opt for such a longer-term CD, try to find one that is not “callable.” A callable CD is one that the issuer can decide to close out before its maturity date, which might happen if rates fall considerably during the next few years.\n\n“The call feature is a ‘Heads I win, tails you lose’ for the issuing bank,” McBride said.', 'Timing and magnitude matter', 'Published 12:00 PM EDT, Sat July 27, 2024', 'smart-moves-to-make-when-the-fed-starts-cutting-rates-1745807994'),

Late payments and last-warning service-cutoff notices. Multiple daily bank withdrawals. Out-of-character purchases.\n\nWhen a family member who has been fairly responsible with money all their lives becomes careless with their finances, it may be one sign of as-yet-undiagnosed dementia.\n\nResearchers at the New York Federal Reserve who analyzed both US credit reporting and Medicare data found that in the five years before a dementia diagnosis, a person’s average credit scores may start to weaken and their payment delinquencies rise.\n\n“The harmful financial effects of undiagnosed memory disorders exacerbate the already substantial financial pressure households face upon diagnosis,” the researchers wrote. “Beyond susceptibility to payment delinquency, early stage [Alzheimer’s disease and related disorders] may affect new account openings and debt accumulation, credit utilization, and/or credit mix.”\n\nTheir findings echo the results of a 2020 study from the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.\n\nMarcey Tidwell, who lives in Bloomington, Indiana, said those findings are “not remotely shocking.” Tidwell’s mother was diagnosed with a form of dementia in 2020 and has been living with her daughter ever since.\n\nTidwell said that for most of her life, her mother was an “outrageously methodical human being” who kept the bills paid and the family records organized across many moves as her husband pursued a career in the military.\n\nAfter going through her mother’s papers this year, Tidwell surmises that her mother’s memory started faltering around 2015, because from that point forward her record-keeping became “less than pristine.”\n\nFor example, Tidwell said, her mom used to keep an immaculate record of checks written and deposits and withdrawals made in her checkbook register. But that register became a mess. “There was a bunch of stuff scratched out and she was obsessively adding and re-adding — she knew things weren’t all they could be. Later on, I saw that she took out large amounts of her savings, more than she needed for groceries.”\n\nKaren Lemay, who lives in Ottawa, Canada, knew something was really wrong with her father in 2022 when she saw on his desk piles of late-payment notices and final-notification warnings from service providers and insurers.\n\nHer father was a former finance executive who “was very conservative with his money, very smart about it and never reckless with it,” she said. And he had strongly impressed upon his daughter the importance of paying off her credit card in full every month to avoid interest.\n\nYet Lemay discovered he owed $50,000 in charges, interest and late payment fees on a Visa card. He also financed the purchase of a new car he didn’t need, just months before police took away his driver’s license. Normally, he would only buy high-end used cars with cash, she said.\n\nWhat’s more, his daughter noted, he failed to pay his 2021 taxes. So he ended up owing the government roughly $20,000, the bulk of which was for late payment and underpayment penalties.\n\n“I spoke to him about some of his balances and he refused to believe he hadn’t paid them,” Lemay said.\n\nJayne Sibley, who lives in the United Kingdom, knows the pain and stress of dealing with the financial behaviors that can signal dementia. Her father and mother were both diagnosed with different forms of it.\n\nHer father moved into a nursing home years ago, but her now-deceased mother remained in her own home, albeit with live-in care.\n\n“The most challenging thing we faced was managing mum’s everyday money as her condition progressed. She would overspend on things she didn’t need or want. Random items, cleaning equipment, luxury food. She also fell victim to scams over the phone — a fake insurance policy, those sorts of things,” Sibley said.\n\nHer mother also would take money out of the cash machine two to three times a day and give it to anyone who asked.\n\nAcutely aware of how high long-term care costs were, given her father’s situation, Sibley said she worried that her mother would run through the money that would be needed for her own care.\n\nWhile her mother’s condition made her vulnerable with money, she initially was still able to walk and shop and go to yoga on her own. In other words, she was able to maintain a lot of her autonomy and social ties.\n\nTo try to stem the money outflow, Sibley and her brother tried doling out a week’s worth of cash for their mother “but she’d spend it all in one go,” she said. Ditto when they tried divvying the cash up into daily envelopes.\n\nEventually, they took away her cash card. But, soon after, her condition worsened, Sibley said. “She wasn’t able to maintain her familiar routines and social connections. That’s when we realized there has to be a better way.”\n\nWith her husband, she founded Sibstar, which offers a debit card in the UK that can be used by a person with dementia to maintain some sense of financial autonomy and social engagement. When needed, family caregivers can monitor their debit transactions via an app. As a person’s condition worsens, the caregiver can set limits on how much money can be spent on any given day or week, and where the card can be used (eg, at cash machines, online or at the grocery store).\n\nWhile there are few dementia-specific financial tools to reduce the odds that someone squanders their own hard-earned money, there are steps you can take to make it easier to assume control over another person’s finances when they become incapacitated.\n\nIn 2008, a year after her father died without a will and a dozen years before her mother was diagnosed with dementia, Tidwell said she and her siblings took their mother to a lawyer to make sure she had a will, named her medical proxy and named the person to whom she would give power of attorney to handle her financial affairs should the need arise.\n\nThat made it easier for Tidwell, among other things, to get online access in 2018 to her mother’s bank account to make sure nothing was amiss. By 2020, she had automated her mother’s bill paying online.\n\n“The time to make plans is before you need to. It’s hard to overstate what a gift that trip to the lawyer in 2008 was to ‘future me,’” said Tidwell, who fully manages her mother’s finances now that her condition has worsened considerably.\n\nSince dementia can worsen over time and because someone in the initial stages may not recognize they are more vulnerable to financial errors and scams, the US National Institute on Aging recommends that a family take steps early on to alleviate those concerns, such as setting up automated bill payments for the person with dementia.\n\nOf course, no amount of advanced financial planning can alleviate the heartbreak of watching a loved one with dementia decline. “I prepared as best as I could, but it’s still hard,” Tidwell said. That’s why she advises anyone potentially facing a similar situation to, in her words, “make the easy part easy.”', '‘Methodical’ military spouse’s record-keeping deteriorates', 'Updated 11:46 AM EDT, Mon July 8, 2024', 'early-signs-of-dementia-can-show-in-your-finances-1745807994'),

Under the rule, app developers distributing their apps via Apple’s App Store should be able to inform customers, free of charge, of alternative offers outside the store, steer them to those and allow them to make purchases.\n\nDue to a number of restrictions imposed by the US tech giant, “consumers cannot fully benefit from alternative and cheaper offers,” the European Commission said in a statement.\n\nA representative for Apple said the fine is “yet another example of the European Commission unfairly targeting” the company and forcing it to “give away (its) technology for free.” It added that it plans to appeal the decision.\n\n“We have spent hundreds of thousands of engineering hours and made dozens of changes to comply with this law, none of which our users have asked for. Despite countless meetings, the Commission continues to move the goal posts every step of the way,” the representative said.\n\nThe size of Apple’s and Meta’s respective fines reflects the “gravity and duration” of the companies’ breaches of the DMA, the European Commission said, adding that they must pay the fines within 60 days or risk additional financial penalties.\n\nViolations of the landmark law can lead to stiff penalties, including fines of up to 10% of a company’s annual global revenue and up to 20% for repeat offenses.\n\nMeta raked in more than $164 billion in revenue last year, while Apple made $391 billion during its last financial year.

And now, nearly half of US teens say social media has a mostly negative effect on people their age — and almost the same proportion say they’re cutting back on social media use.\n\nThat’s according to a Pew Research Center report published Tuesday that asked American teens and parents about their attitudes around social media and smartphones. It offers an updated glimpse into how teens view their own social media use, following a separate Pew study from December that found nearly half of US teens say they’re online almost constantly.\n\nThe report comes as parents and regulators have called on social media companies to do more to keep young people safe — and prevent them from spending too much time — on their platforms.\n\nLast year, then-Surgeon General Vivek Murthy asked Congress to require a label on social media apps warning of risks to young people, similar to those on alcohol and tobacco. Australia also passed a world-first law banning teens under 16 from social media. And in March, Utah Governor Spencer Cox signed a landmark bill requiring app stores to verify users’ ages and share that data with app developers, in a bid to protect teens from accessing age-inappropriate content online.\n\nTo conduct the study, Pew surveyed 1,391 US teens ages 13 to 17 and their parents during September and October of last year.\n\nOf the teen respondents, 48% said they think social media has a “mostly negative” effect on people their age, up from 32% when Pew asked the same questions in a different survey in 2022. Just 11% of teens today say they think social media is “mostly positive” for their peers.\n\nBut just 14% of teens say social media has a mostly negative impact on themselves, although that figure has jumped from 9% in 2022.\n\nStill, teens are seemingly trying to rein in their own social media use; 45% say they spend too much time on social media, up from 36% in 2022. And 44% of teen respondents said they have cut back on time spent on social media and their smartphones.\n\n“The overuse of social media in our society seems to be the main cause of depression among those in my age group,” a teen boy quoted in the report wrote. “People seem to let themselves be affected by the opinions of people they don’t know, and it wreaks havoc upon people’s states of mind.”\n\n.The report suggests that the effects of social media vary somewhat by gender and race and ethnicity. Teen girls, for example, are slightly more likely than teen boys to say social media has hurt the amount of sleep they get, their productivity, their mental health and their confidence.\n\nThose findings are consistent with research from 2019 that has suggested the link between social media and depression may be stronger in teen girls than boys, and that social media may harm girls’ mental health by increasing their exposure to bullying and decreasing activities that have a positive impact on wellbeing, such as sleep.\n\nIn 2021, internal documents from social media giant Meta, made public after a whistleblower disclosure, showed that the company’s research found that Instagram makes “body image issues worse for one in three teen girls.” Meta has since introduced new policies and practices aimed at improving teen safety, including updated AI tools announced Monday designed to catch teens lying about their age on the app.\n\nGirls (48%) are more likely to say they’ve cut back on social media use than boys (40%), according to Tuesday’s report.\n\nGeneral mental wellbeing among teens is a broader concern; 89% of parents and 77% of teens reported being either “somewhat” or “extremely” worried about the issue.\n\nBut parents are still more anxious about how social media is impacting their children than the teens themselves, the report suggests. Social media (44%) and technology generally (14%) ranked highest as the one thing parents believed negatively impacted teens’ mental health, whereas only 22% and 8% of teens, respectively, said the same.\n\n“Technology, which is making them more afraid to try things, makes them less creative and makes them less likely to figure out how to solve their own problems, whether relationally or physically,” a mother of a teen said in the survey.\n\nHowever, it’s not all bad.\n\nNearly six in 10 teens said social media gives them “a place to show their creative side,” and even more said it helps them stay connected to what’s happening in their friends’ lives.', '', 'Published 7:30 AM EDT, Tue April 22, 2025', 'nearly-half-of-teens-say-social-media-is-bad-for-youth-mental-health-report-finds-1745807994'),

While Apple has shifted some production to other regions like India, April estimates from Wedbush Securities indicate 90% of iPhone production is still in China.\n\nSmartphones and select other tech devices and parts fall under Trump’s exceptions to reciprocal tariffs, which was viewed as a reprieve for Apple and other phone makers. But the administration also promises that a different bucket of tariffs targeted specifically at semiconductors – the components that power electronics – are coming soon.\n\nSamsung, the world’s largest smartphone maker by market share by some analyst estimates, certainly isn’t immune from tariffs or the economic impact they may bring. But it also doesn’t depend on a country that’s been the biggest target of Trump’s tariff offensive to produce its smartphones, meaning it may not have to upend its mobile device operations in a major way, should tariffs on smartphones from China send prices skyrocketing.\n\n“The advantage is, yes, that they’re not facing the whatever crazy number we are currently dealing with,” said Gerrit Schneemann, a senior analyst for Counterpoint Research covering the smartphone industry.\n\nBut that doesn’t mean that Samsung will gain an immediate advantage, Schneemann added.\n\n“At the same time, there’s not a direct line to turning that into just an exponential boost in sales,” he said.\n\nThe tech industry relies on China’s vast network of component suppliers and assembly facilities to mass produce consumer devices like smartphones, laptops and monitors. Some of those devices are exempt from reciprocal tariffs, but many gadgets aren’t, including video game consoles and earbuds.\n\nTrade tensions between the two economic powerhouses ratcheted up again on Monday when Beijing threatened reciprocal measures against any country that restricts trade with China to appease the United States. Earlier this month, the Trump administration issued a 90-day pause in reciprocal tariffs against most countries except China.\n\nAnalysts at Wedbush Securities, led by managing director Dan Ives, wrote in an April 20 note that negotiations with China need to happen “ASAP” for the sake of “the markets, tech world, and US economy.”\n\n“Otherwise this tariff and trade war will inflict major damage to growth while increasing inflation… and leaving the tech world with many questions and no answers to plan their future strategy,” the note reads.\n\nApple, given its dependence on China, has been a central focus of the tech industry’s tariff woes, with analysts from UBS estimating the price of an iPhone 16 Pro Max assembled in China could skyrocket by $800. That estimate was made prior to Trump saying that smartphones are exempt from reciprocal tariffs. Just 5% of iPhones are made in Vietnam and India, while another 5% are produced in other countries, according to Wedbush.\n\nThe situation is much different for Samsung, which closed its last phone factory in China in 2019 after losing market share to domestic rivals in the country, though it still has other operations there. Sources within Samsung told CNN that the vast majority of its smartphone manufacturing takes place in South Korea, Vietnam, India and Brazil.\n\nThat lines up with figures from analysts, as Counterpoint Research estimates 90% of Samsung’s smartphone production is in Vietnam. The International Data Corporation, a market research firm, estimated that roughly 50-60% of Samsung’s smartphone production is based in Vietnam, while India is the company’s second largest phone production hub, with South Korea and Latin America largely making up the rest.\n\nSamsung opened what it called “the world’s largest mobile factory” in India in 2018 and was the largest exporter of smartphones from India in 2024, according to Counterpoint Research, though Apple also has a large presence, with both companies accounting for about 94% of the country’s smartphone exports.\n\nSamsung could also benefit from its dual role as both a seller of consumer electronics and a manufacturer of components like displays, memory and chips, according to Ben Barringer, a global technology analyst for investment management firm Quilter Cheviot.\n\n“Samsung probably has a bit of an advantage in the sense that Samsung is one of the few companies in the world that’s vertically integrated,” said Barringer.\n\nStill, some analysts are skeptical that Samsung’s diversified manufacturing will lead to a boost in sales. Apple customers can be fiercely loyal, and it’s unclear whether price hikes would change that.\n\n“People just aren’t necessarily switching away from Apple to Samsung in general,” said Schneemann.\n\nLinda Sui, senior director of global smartphone strategies for analysis firm TechInsights, also believes Apple will be able to shift production of iPhones destined for the US market to India. The company had reportedly been ramping up iPhone shipments from India to the United States, according to reports from The Financial Times and The Times of India.\n\nApple and Samsung also cater to different types of smartphone buyers. Apple is known for selling just a few iPhone models, virtually all of them premium devices with higher margins. Samsung, on the other hand, generally sells a wider variety of phones – particularly at the lower end of the price spectrum with its line of Galaxy A series phones, which Schneemann says are Samsung’s “volume drivers.”\n\n“For Samsung, it’s a mixed bag,” he said, as Apple dominates the higher end of the market.\n\nTrump’s tariffs are part of a broader effort to bring manufacturing back to the United States, meaning other nations — including Vietnam and India — also face levies, albeit lower ones of 10% for now, which means Samsung is still likely to be affected by tariffs in some capacity.\n\nBut the larger concern is whether the state of the economy could impact consumer spending, possibly dampening demand for smartphones as Trump’s tariffs could potentially raise prices on everything from toys to groceries.\n\nThat could push consumers to hold onto their devices for longer periods of time, particularly in mature smartphone markets like the United States, where premium phones tend to be popular, said Schneemann. Demand in emerging markets, where smartphone shipments have seen more growth, could also slow if consumers “feel the pinch,” he said.\n\n“Daily necessities and essentials are going to be higher on the list then maybe a new or upgraded smartphone,” Schneemann said.', 'Trump’s tariffs on China could roil the tech industry', 'Published 6:30 AM EDT, Tue April 22, 2025', 'the-iphones-biggest-rival-may-have-one-advantage-in-trumps-tariff-war-1745807994'),

And it is the third such decision since a federal jury in December 2023 found that Google’s proprietary app store is also an illegal monopoly.\n\nTaken together, the trio of decisions highlights the breadth of trouble Google faces, raising the prospect of sweeping penalties that could reshape multiple aspects of its business, though ongoing and expected appeals will likely take years to play out.\n\nThursday’s decision by District Judge Leonie Brinkema, of the US District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, addresses the $31 billion portion of Google’s ad business that matches website publishers with advertisers. This “stack” of technologies determines what banner ads appear on countless sites across the web.\n\nThe Justice Department’s lawsuit followed years of criticism that Google’s extensive role in the digital ecosystem that enables advertisers to place ads, and for publishers to offer up digital ad space, represented a conflict of interest that Google exploited anticompetitively.\n\nBrinkema sided with the Justice Department’s argument that by tying its ad server and publisher ad exchange together, Google was able to “establish and protect its monopoly power in these two markets, she wrote in her 115-page decision.\n\nBut she also struck down one of the government’s claims related to Google’s online advertiser ad networks.\n\n“We won half of this case and we will appeal the other half,” Google’s Vice President of Regulatory Affairs Lee-Anne Mulholland said in a statement following the decision.\n\n“The Court found that our advertiser tools and our acquisitions, such as DoubleClick, don’t harm competition,” Mullholland said. “We disagree with the Court’s decision regarding our publisher tools. Publishers have many options and they choose Google because our ad tech tools are simple, affordable and effective.”\n\nThe Department of Justice did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nGoogle had argued that the Justice Department’s argument is “flawed” and would “slow innovation, raise advertising fees, and make it harder for thousands of small businesses and publishers to grow,” according to a statement from a company spokesperson after the lawsuit was filed in 2023.\n\nHowever, Brinkema argued in her decision that Google’s practices have deprived “rivals of the ability to compete” and “substantially harmed Google’s publisher customers, the competitive process, and, ultimately, consumers of information on the open web.”\n\nThe decision could force Google to divest part of its online ad business. But the fact that the government did not win on all of its claims makes that outcome less likely, said William Kovacic, global competition professor of law and policy at The George Washington University Law School.\n\n“The general idea in other antitrust cases is that the remedy has to be proportional,” Kovacic said. “The broader the finding of illegality, the deeper the finding of deliberateness… the greater the platform for a bolder remedy.”\n\nStill, he said, Google could get stuck with a conduct remedy — such as restrictions on how it can operate or price its services — “that would not be good for them.”\n\nSome tech critics and media organizations cheered the ruling.\n\n“For years, Google wielded unchecked monopoly power over the digital advertising market – using it to suffocate the media industry and force middleman taxes on everything we buy online,” said Sacha Haworth, executive director of the Tech Oversight Project, who called the decision an “unequivocal win for the American people.”\n\nSenator Elizabeth Warren said in a statement Thursday that the decision is “a big win in the fight to break up Big Tech … the result of years of work to rein in tech companies’ abuses.”\n\nThe decision is part of a wider push by regulators to check the power of large tech companies including Apple, Meta and Amazon in addition to Google parent Alphabet. Just this week, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg took the stand in a trial over a blockbuster antitrust lawsuit in which the US Federal Trade Commission accused the social media giant of buying would-be competitors to stifle competition.\n\nThursday’s decision, Kovacic said, could “lend impetus” to efforts around the world to crack down on Google and other tech giants and “give them confidence to push ahead.”\n\n–This story has been updated with additional details and context.', '', 'Updated 3:38 PM EDT, Thu April 17, 2025', 'google-is-an-online-advertising-monopoly-judge-rules-1745807994'),

Marjorie Taylor Greene.', 'Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene on Wednesday used a DOGE subcommittee hearing to call for the defunding and dismantling of the company that provides NPR and PBS with federal funds.\n\nFor Taylor Greene and other House Republicans, today’s hearing was about tarnishing PBS and NPR with accusations of bias and targeting them for defunding. For the broadcasters, today was about defending their existence.\n\nThe hearing, titled “Anti-American Airwaves: Holding the heads of NPR and PBS Accountable,” started at 10 am ET, and featured testimony from NPR CEO Katherine Maher and PBS CEO Paula Kerger, as well as a local station operator and a conservative critic of taxpayer-funded media.\n\nThe hearing, which was chaired by Taylor Greene, was meant to advance long-held Republican arguments against PBS and NPR, including that their programming is “communist.”\n\nIn the final minutes of the two-hour hearing that saw repeated conservative attacks on the public broadcasters, Taylor Greene said that “we can look no further than the Corporation for Public Broadcasting” as the culprit for US debt.\n\n“After listening to what we’ve heard, today, we will be calling for the complete and total defund and dismantling of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting,” Taylor Greene said.\n\nPresident Donald Trump on said Tuesday that the networks are a “waste of money” and claimed “he would love to” defund them. And yet the funding bill passed by Congress and signed into law by Trump earlier this month included $535 million for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, the entity that disburses funds to 1,500 local radio and TV stations. Congress budgets money for CPB two years in advance, so the recent bill means public broadcasting is funded through 2027.\n\nThroughout the hearing, legislators pressed Maher and Kerger on their roles in allegedly circulating disinformation, accusing the pair of fostering newsrooms that cater to elite audiences.\n\n“NPR and PBS have increasingly become radical left-wing echo chambers for a narrow audience of mostly wealthy, white urban liberals and progressives who generally look down on and judge rural America,” Taylor Greene said at the hearing’s overture before accusing the pair of “grooming and sexualizing” children, using DEI for listener demographics, and wasting taxpayer dollars.\n\nMaher and Kerger also faced attacks from Rep. James Comer, who, in addition to accusing NPR and PBS of peddling “disinformation” and “propaganda,” claimed the public broadcasters are obsolete in an age marked by a “menu of media options” that includes podcasts and satellite radio.\n\nCongressional Republicans repeatedly peppered Maher and Kerger with accusations regarding their coverage of the COVID-19 origins lab leak theory, Russian collusion, and Hunter Biden’s laptop.\n\nMaher said that the public broadcaster was “mistaken” in “failing” to cover the Hunter Biden laptop story sooner and more aggressively. When Cloud asked Maher about the lab leak theory, the NPR boss emphasized that the outlet’s current editorial leadership recognizes that “the new CIA evidence is worthy of coverage,” stressing that it has reported just that.\n\nMaher and Kerger spent the two-hour hearing defending their respective organizations, pushing back against conservative claims by stressing that most Americans trust public broadcasters to service local communities and provide a wide variety of reporting and educational programming. To elucidate her point, Maher noted that more than 60% of all Americans — and more than half of Republicans — trust public broadcasting to deliver fact-based news. Kerger noted “there’s nothing more American than PBS as a membership organization.”\n\nLocal TV and radio stations also used the opportunity to justify their federal funding. From North Country Public Radio in upstate New York, to New Mexico PBS in Albuquerque, to Hawaiʻi Public Radio in Honolulu, publicly supported stations are using the right’s political attacks to galvanize grassroots support and raise money from donors.\n\nHawaiʻi Public Radio CEO Meredith Artley, the former editor in chief of CNN Digital, wrote that her news and classical music stations are “94% community supported,” with the remaining 6% coming from CPB. If the federal funds were diminished, the Hawaii stations would survive, but “there would likely be damage to the nationwide system that provides programming and infrastructure that HPR and many other stations rely on,” she wrote.\n\nThat’s the key point: It’s a system. And smaller stations tend to need more help from the system. At KTOO Public Media in Alaska, for example, fully 30% of the budget comes from CPB. “This federal funding is essential in ensuring that Juneau’s only local-owned newsroom can continue to deliver you the news from our community,” the station said.\n\nCongressional Democrats came to the public broadcasters’ aid throughout the hearing, stressing that journalism and the free press are currently under attack by “extremists” and are needed “more than ever.”\n\n“Public broadcasting is a tool for education, for emergencies, and a cherished part of our national fabric,” Rep. Robert Garcia said. “The majority and our chairwoman should drop this attempt to silence media voices they don’t like.”\n\nRep. Greg Casar chastised the committee for focusing on defunding NPR and PBS instead of DOGE’s head, Elon Musk, whose companies — which include X, SpaceX, Tesla, and Starlink — make billions each year while still taking home $3 billion per year in government contracts.\n\n“That’s six times the money that goes to all of public broadcasting. Private insurers and Medicare Advantage overcharged taxpayers $83 billion,” Casar said. “Just last year, that could pay for public broadcasting 160 times over.”\n\n“To borrow a phrase from Sesame Street, the letter of the day is C and it stands for corruption,” he said.\n\nPress freedom groups have also defended the public broadcasters. Ahead of the hearing, the Center for Democracy & Technology’s president and chief executive, Alexandra Reeve Givens, called the meeting an attempt by the Trump administration “to bully their perceived enemies and silence legitimate journalism.” Reporters Without Borders executive director Clayton Weimars said he was “deeply concerned the House hearing on bias in NPR and PBS is a political stunt that will create a slippery slope towards politicians dictating the programming of public news outlets.”\n\nStations large and small also highlighted their local responsibilities.\n\n“Whatever happens in Washington, DC — WQED is not going anywhere,” Jason Jedlinski, CEO of Pittsburgh’s PBS station, wrote on LinkedIn.

In November, President Donald Trump slapped CBS News and its parent company, Paramount Global, with a $10 billion lawsuit that claims a “60 Minutes” interview with former Vice President Kamala Harris was grossly mis-edited by CBS at the Harris campaign’s direction.\n\nSince then, Trump has repeatedly called for the network to lose its license and urged the Federal Communications Commission to punish the broadcaster. Ultimately, “60 Minutes” handed over the full transcript and video of the contested interview to the FCC, and Trump and Paramount this month agreed on a mediator in the lawsuit.\n\nOwens’ resignation provides Trump with another major victory against the broadcaster.\n\nTuesday’s announcement also comes as Shari Redstone — the media heiress who holds a controlling share of National Amusements, Paramount Global’s parent company — continues to seek a merger between Paramount and David Ellison’s Skydance Media. During a February meeting, Redstone told Paramount’s board of directors that she wanted to resolve the “60 Minutes” lawsuit.\n\nAfter Owens announced his resignation, McMahon applauded Owens’ “illustrious career” in an email to staffers obtained by CNN.\n\n“As Executive Producer, Bill has led 60 Minutes with unwavering integrity, curiosity, and a deep commitment to the truth,” McMahon wrote. “He has championed the kind of journalism that informs, enlightens, and often changes the national conversation.”\n\nPer McMahon, Owens will remain with “60 Minutes” during “the weeks ahead,” and executives are already holding conversations with correspondents and senior leaders. No replacement was immediately identified for Owens, who has been with CBS News for 37 years, 24 of which were at “60 Minutes.”\n\nOwens could not be reached for comment. CBS did not offer additional comment beyond the company memo.\n\nShortly after reports of Owens’ resignation emerged, two “60 Minutes” producers spoke anonymously with CNN’s Jake Tapper.\n\nOne such source called Trump’s lawsuit “baseless” and stressed Owens’ refusal to apologize or bend while noting the top producer “fought for the broadcast and for independent journalism and that cost him his job.”\n\nA second source was blunter.\n\n“It‘s like a guy who has been battling for months against an attack,” this person said. “He sacrificed himself hoping it might make our corporate overlords wake up and realize they risk destroying what makes 60 Minutes great.”', '', 'Updated 10:34 PM EDT, Tue April 22, 2025', '60-minutes-executive-producer-resigns-citing-a-loss-of-independence-in-the-wake-of-trump-lawsuit-1745807994'),

The decision reaffirms an important tenet of American law: publishers are not liable for honest mistakes,” a Times spokesperson said in a statement.\n\nRepresentatives for Palin did not immediately respond to a request for comment. However, the former governor took to X shortly after the ruling to lament her loss in court.\n\n“But please keep fighting for integrity in media,” she wrote. “I’ll keep asking the press to quit making things up.”\n\nThe retrial’s outcome comes as little surprise, however, given both Rakoff and a federal jury ruled against Palin the first time around. Still, the media landscape has changed over the past few years as trust in media has declined, setting up a situation that was potentially less favorable to the Times.\n\nPalin first filed her lawsuit against the Times and former editor James Bennet in June 2017 after the paper ran an editorial alleging Palin had engaged in “political incitement” ahead of the 2011 shooting of Gabby Giffords. According to Palin’s lawsuit, the editorial incorrectly claimed an advertisement run by the former governor’s political action committee placed “Giffords and 19 other Democrats under stylized cross hairs.”\n\nThe Times released a correction less than 24 hours later, clarifying that “no such link was established” but noting that the error did not “undercut or weaken the argument of the piece.”\n\nThe Times’ Tuesday victory comes as news publishers have increasingly been the target of legal attacks.\n\nOther than the Trump administration’s legal moves against publishers, some conservatives have in recent years taken aim at Times v Sullivan, the landmark 1964 ruling that has for decades protected media outlets from defamation lawsuits from public figures. Conservatives initially hailed Palin’s renewed effort for being an entry point into dismantling the ruling, though those hopes were quickly quashed by the Second Circuit Court, which found Palin had waived her rights to challenge the actual malice standard after she waited too long to make that argument.\n\nIn fending off Palin’s renewed legal assault during a time when the government and the president have shown themselves to be unfavorable toward the press, the Times exemplified the merits of standing by its work and corrections at a time when reporters are being labeled enemies of the people.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional information and context.', '', 'Updated 6:57 PM EDT, Tue April 22, 2025', 'sarah-palin-loses-her-defamation-retrial-against-the-new-york-times-1745807994'),

Streaming on Mars? It may not be as far away as you think.\n\nThat’s the shared vision of NASA and Nokia, who have partnered to set up a cellular network on the Moon to help lay the building blocks for long-term human presence on other planets.\n\nA SpaceX rocket is due to launch this year — the exact date has yet to be confirmed — carrying a simple 4G network to the Moon. The lander will install the system at the Moon’s south pole and then it will be remotely controlled from Earth.\n\n“The first challenge to getting a network up and running is having a space-qualified cellular equipment that meets the appropriate size, weight, and power requirements, as well as being deployed without a technician,” Walt Engelund, deputy associate administrator for programs at NASA’s Space Technology Mission Directorate, told CNN. No less of a challenge, it will need to operate in the harsh lunar environment of extreme temperatures and radiation.\n\nThe 4G network unit is being built by Nokia’s Bell Labs using a range of off-the-shelf commercial components. It will be loaded onto a lander made by US company Intuitive Machines, and once deployed it will connect the lander via radio equipment to two roaming vehicles with their own special mission: to search for ice.\n\nOne of the vehicles, the Lunar Outpost rover, will explore the area known as Shackleton Connecting Ridge, while the other, the Micro-Nova hopper, will plunge into a crater to scan for unprecedented up-close evidence of Moon ice.\n\nImages of ice — transmitted back to the lander and then Earth in near real-time via the cellular network — would be a world-first. Lunar ice could be used to create breathable oxygen, and even fuel that could eventually be used to launch Mars missions from the Moon.\n\nFor NASA’s Artemis program, which aims to return astronauts to the moon this decade, cellular connectivity is invaluable.\n\nCurrently, astronauts talk to each other by radio, but NASA wants a lunar communications system capable of supporting high-resolution video and science data, said Engelund — especially as Artemis missions become more sophisticated.\n\n“Being able to communicate on the Moon is critical to Artemis — as critical as any other mission element like power, water to drink, and air to breathe,” said Engelund.\n\n“Eventually, this effort will help establish a lunar communications network that could give our explorers the ability to beam scientific data back, confer with mission control, and talk to their families, as if they were walking down the street on their cellphones.”\n\nIt could lay the groundwork for an off-world internet not dissimilar to that of Earth’s. Personal devices could connect to such networks, allowing ﻿space colonists to use smartphones that can access all the apps and services available to those back on Earth.\n\nNASA selected Bell Labs as part of its Tipping Point initiative, a series of partnerships with companies to develop technologies for future missions that puts them in prime position for key roles in the future space economy.\n\nBell Labs was given a $14.1 million grant in 2020, and in January, Nokia was selected by the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) to begin working on a communications services infrastructure that will eventually serve as the “framework for the lunar economy.”\n\n“A future lunar economy will critically depend on communication technologies to collect and analyze data, share information, and maintain and control operations,” Thierry Klein, president of Bell Labs Solutions Research, told CNN.\n\n“This includes sustaining a semi-permanent or permanent human presence on the Moon, as well as automated robotic operations for transportation, resource mining, mineral processing and scientific data collection.”\n\nThere are potential commercial benefits for Earthly business ventures too.\n\nIf a network can withstand the journey into orbit, then deploy and endure autonomously amid the vacuum of space, wildly fluctuating temperatures and cosmic radiation, it will be able to survive the harshest locations on Earth — such as polar ice caps, deserts, or offshore platforms.\n\n“Especially when it comes to remote deployments, industrial sites, public safety, emergency response, disaster recovery or defense, it is highly beneficial to have compact, low-footprint network equipment that can be easily transported and deployed anywhere,” Klein said.', '', 'Updated 7:27 AM EDT, Wed April 24, 2024', 'streaming-and-texting-on-the-moon-nokia-and-nasa-are-taking-4g-into-space-1745807994'),

The IEA includes battery electric vehicles and plug-in hybrid vehicles in its definition of EVs.\n\nThe agency’s bullish long-term outlook for EVs — based on current government policies — comes just days after the world’s biggest battery EV maker Tesla slashed its prices in major markets to counter declining sales and growing competition from Chinese upstarts and established carmakers.\n\nRecent negative headlines about slowing EV penetration are out of step with positive global trends, according to IEA executive director Fatih Birol. The data “does not at all show a reverse of the growth of electric cars. It shows an extremely robust increase of global electric car sales,” he told reporters Tuesday.\n\nThe growth is not driven just by Chinese buyers. The number of new battery electric cars sold in the European Union rose almost 4% in the first quarter of this year compared with the same period in 2023, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association.\n\nIn a statement, Birol said: “Rather than tapering off, the global EV revolution appears to be gearing up for a new phase of growth.”\n\nDespite the upbeat trends, EV makers are grappling with slim profit margins, squeezed by price wars as competition heats.\n\nIn the past few days, Tesla and Chinese EV maker Li Auto have cut prices on major models in China, the world’s biggest EV market, with Tesla also cutting prices in Germany and the United States.\n\nEarlier this month, Tesla posted its first annual drop in sales in nearly four years. The company’s stock has plunged more than 40% so far this year. China’s BYD has also stumbled after it briefly surpassed Tesla as global market leader, with its sales falling to about 300,000 in the first quarter from more than 525,000 in the final three months of 2023.\n\nAutomakers may be hurting from the price cuts but they will be crucial to increasing the take-up of EVs around the world, according to the IEA, which emphasized that the “pace of the transition to EVs… will hinge on affordability.”\n\nIn China, more than 60% of EVs sold last year were less expensive than conventional cars, but in Europe and the United States the purchase price for new cars with internal combustion engines remains lower on average.\n\n“Intensifying market competition and improving battery technologies are expected to reduce (EV) prices in the coming years,” the IEA said.\n\n“Growing electric car exports from Chinese automakers, which accounted for more than half of all electric car sales in 2023, could add to downward pressure on purchase prices,” it added.\n\nLast year, Chinese carmakers accounted for more than half of global electric car sales, compared with their 10% share of the conventional car market. “China is the de facto leader of electric car manufacturing around the world,” Birol said.\n\nConcerns about soaring imports of Chinese EVs prompted the European Union to open an investigation late last year into China’s state support for EV makers. The auto industry is a major employer in Europe and crucial to the region’s biggest economy, Germany, which is home to Volkswagen, Audi and BMW.\n\nEV sales in China will account for almost 60% of the global total this year and about 45% of all car sales in the country.\n\nBy 2030, almost one in three cars on the roads in China is set to be electric, up from fewer than one in 10 last year, according to the IEA. That compares with its forecast for 17% in the United States and 18% in the European Union, compared with just over 2% and almost 4% respectively last year.\n\n“This shift will have major ramifications for both the auto industry and the energy sector,” Birol said. The IEA sees global oil demand peaking in 2030, helped by the electrification of the transport sector.\n\nIn addition to affordability, another barrier to mass adoption of electric cars is a lack of public charging infrastructure in Europe and the United States.\n\nUnder current government policies, the number of public EV charging points worldwide is expected to reach 15 million by the end of the decade, a near-fourfold increase from last year, according to the IEA.\n\nOlesya Dmitracova contributed to this article, which has been updated with additional content.', '', 'Updated 6:55 AM EDT, Tue April 23, 2024', 'the-electric-car-revolution-is-on-track-says-iea-1745807994');

She is animated using Unreal Engine — a 3D modeling software widely used in video games — combined with motion-capture. Generative artificial intelligence allows her to remember information and respond to questions, using a voice also generated by AI.\n\n“She’s probably one of the only digital humans in the performance space that you can have a conversation and interact with,” says Denise Harris, CCO of startup Sum Vivas. “You can ask her anything. She is a genius about music.”\n\nLast month, Dex performed at Digital Fashion Weeks in New York, Paris and Milan, and she has modeled outfits by Prada and Louis Vuitton at digital fashion events.\n\nFor Liverpool-based Sum Vivas she’s a “showpiece” for more practical applications. The company is now developing digital humans that can “listen” to people’s questions and converse in real time. “Shellie” can provide product information as an avatar on company websites, while “Arif” is set to direct passengers and answer questions as a multilingual concierge on screens at airports.\n\nAccording to CEO and founder Rob Sims, digital humans can help bridge the gap between AI technology and people. “What we’ve found is when people start working with and conversing with a digital human, they very quickly suspend disbelief,” Sims tells CNN. “It becomes natural.”\n\nSince OpenAI’s ChatGPT was launched in November 2022, considerable hype has surrounded the potential of generative AI — artificial intelligence powered by huge datasets of information, capable of generating text outputs in a conversational way.\n\nRecord levels of investment into generative AI have followed, with over $21 billion poured into the industry during the first nine months of last year, according to data insights company Pitchbook. In March 2023, Google launched Bard (recently renamed Gemini) and around the same time Anthropic released its AI assistant Claude. As generative AI chatbots become increasingly ubiquitous, Sum Vivas is one of several companies looking to make them more human.\n\nUS and New Zealand-based UneeQ has developed animated conversational “digital humans” that can be used as virtual sales reps and customer service agents on company websites, and this month it debuted Sama 2.0, an animated cabin crew member that answers questions on Qatar Airways’ website and app.\n\nMicrosoft recently announced that users of its Azure software would be able to create lifelike avatars capable of turning text prompts into animated speech. However, there are widespread concerns about the impact AI could have on the job market.\n\n“When we rely on automated tools, what skills are we losing in the process?” asks Jennifer Ding, senior researcher at the Alan Turing Institute, the UK’s national institute for data science and artificial intelligence. “In some ways, we think of AI as something that’s helping us or augmenting our work,” she says. “However, alongside, this fear of replacement is bubbling up more and more.”\n\nHarris, however, points to new opportunities within digital human design and development. “Every scenario that we found, we’re creating jobs and working in harmony with people rather than taking away jobs,” she says.\n\n“Digital humans, first and foremost, should work with other human colleagues,” adds Sims. “We’ll move into a stage where digital humans will start to become just another member of the team, with added benefits for that team, and obviously the customers they serve.”', 'AI explosion', 'Published 5:33 AM EDT, Tue March 19, 2024', 'digital-humans-the-relatable-face-of-artificial-intelligence-1745807994'),

Greenwood was the first user of the aiScout app to get a trial with a professional club.', 'A London-based technology company is looking to “democratize” talent-identification and scouting in soccer using a mobile app.\n\nFree to download and available globally, the aiScout app allows aspiring soccer stars to enter virtual trials for professional clubs by uploading self-recorded footage of themselves completing a series of drills. It offers 75 exercises, designed to test a range of skills, with videos showing users how to complete them.\n\nPerformances are automatically scored by artificial intelligence (AI) technology. The data can then be accessed by clubs, allowing their scouts to peruse scores for viable talent, honing their search with a variety of filters; from age and gender to position on the pitch.\n\nThe app currently has two English Premier League (EPL) partners, Chelsea and Burnley, and clubs can tailor their in-app trials to meet specific needs and set their own benchmarks by having their academy players complete the same drills.\n\n“We’re putting that data up front to make better use of [the scouts’] time,” said Richard Felton-Thomas, chief operating officer of ai.io, the company behind the app.\n\n“To say [to scouts], ‘Go over to this place today because there’s three players in that game that are all actually beating your Chelsea standard’ — that’s going to be the best use of your time.’”\n\nIt already appears to be working for some. Ben Greenwood had never had a trial with a professional club until he downloaded the app in 2019. After uploading footage of himself, the 17-year-old landed a trial with Chelsea, becoming the first user of the app to get a trial with a pro club. He signed a contract with EPL team Bournemouth in 2021.\n\nHaving beta-tested in with players spanning 125 countries, Greenwood among them, 135 players have been trialed or signed by pro clubs or national teams through the app — which fully launched in September 2023 — according to Felton-Thomas.\n\nJust over 100,000 players make up the current database, but with over 100 clubs lined up to join Chelsea and Burnley, as well as a multi-year partnership with Major League Soccer in the US announced last May, Felton-Thomas projects user numbers to surge into the millions as the operation ramps up this year.\n\nFelton-Thomas said the “lion’s share” of its income comes from charging clubs a license fee to run the platform. Annual fees vary depending on the size of the club and the tools they require, ranging from six figures for “tier one” sides like Chelsea, to thousands of pounds for clubs lower down the footballing pyramid.\n\nThe use of smart technology in sport continues to expand, including AI commentary tools and wearable tech for elite athletes. The global market for sports analytics, valued at $2.7 billion in 2023, is projected to grow 22% by the end of the decade, according to market research firm Grand View Research.\n\nShould soccer talent scouts be concerned about being edged out by the arrival of AI in their industry? For Felton-Thomas, new technologies can co-exist with traditional methods.\n\n“It’s more about evolution than revolution,” Felton-Thomas explained.\n\n“We can’t tell you when that player’s actually in that match, how does he deal with adversity? What happens when he’s 2-0 down? What happens when someone’s shouting at him? What happens when he’s just made a massive mistake?”\n\n“We’ve got the ability to just augment real people to do their jobs better and faster, which then gives an opportunity to the player through the AI, but you’re still actually just connecting them to the human on the other side, which is the club and the scout.”\n\nWhile football remains ai.io’s primary focus, the company is looking into opportunities in other sports to launch in the coming years. Further ahead, it may branch out beyond sports.\n\n“You think about the notion that you can be at home and analyze your movements, and how this could spin into health care, physical assessments for military disciplines and emergency services,” Felton-Thomas told CNN.', '‘It’s more about evolution’', 'Published 7:14 AM EST, Fri March 1, 2024', 'top-soccer-clubs-are-using-an-aipowered-app-to-scout-future-stars-1745807994'),

The benchmark index as of Wednesday was still down 12.5% from its peak two months ago. (A 10% decline from a peak is considered a correction. A 20% decline from a peak is considered a bear market).\n\nThe S&P 500 has shed $6.5 trillion in market value since its record high in February, according to Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices.\n\nAs stocks have gyrated, investors are wondering when the market might find a bottom.\n\nThe truth is: No one can know for sure.\n\nThe market hit its lowest closing price this year on April 8, down 18.9% from its February peak. The S&P 500 has yet to test that low again, and it’s anyone’s guess whether the market continues climbing higher.\n\nWhile uncertainty is rife, history can serve as a guide as to when the S&P 500 might find a bottom.\n\nThe S&P has had 24 corrections since the end of World War II, according to Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research. Historically, when the S&P entered correction but did not enter a bear market, it took the index an average of 133 days to find a bottom, and an average of 113 days to recover.\n\nIf April 8 turns out to be the market’s bottom, it would be just 48 days from February’s peak to bottom — much faster than the historical average.\n\nAdditionally, it has historically taken the S&P 500 an average of 77 days to go from a peak to confirming a correction, according to Stovall. This year, it took the benchmark index just 22 days to confirm a correction (a peak on February 19 to a correction on March 13), which is also much faster than the historical average.\n\nTypically, when there is a sharp decline from a peak to correction, the slump tends to be relatively short before the market recovers, according to Stovall.\n\n“Swift declines tend to be shallow and short-lived,” he said. “History is a great guide, but it’s never gospel, so we’ll have to wait and see whether that will hold true.”\n\nAnd vast uncertainty looms. The market correction this year has been driven by the White House’s policy, Stovall said, which is historically rare.\n\n“The only problem is that this is what I call a manufactured correction, meaning that it started because Trump initiated a trade war,” he said. “It is because of what the current administration is doing.”\n\nThe S&P 500’s closing price on April 8 was 4,982.77. Some Wall Street analysts expect the market to “retest” that low before finding a bottom.\n\n“In order for the April 8 lows to hold, investors must see enough of a trade policy shift to give them hope that the worst has passed,” said Nick Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research, in a Monday note.\n\nColas noted that “modern market lore” about retesting lows can go back to the 1987 market crash. On October 19, 1987, The S&P 500 plummeted 20.5% before rebounding about 14% across the next two days. Yet the benchmark index struggled to hold on to those gains and eventually retested its October low point in December. Despite briefly falling below the October low, the December retest turned out to be the bottom.\n\n“Then … the index rallied 10.3% through year end,” Colas said. “Investors saw that as an ‘all clear’ sign, and the S&P went on to gain 16.5% in 1988.”\n\nColas noted that not every market slump historically needed to retest its low, though he said it is “likely” this year due to the amount of uncertainty swirling through markets.\n\nEd Yardeni, president of Yardeni Research, said in a Monday note that the S&P 500 is likely to retest its April 8 low and “probably find support there.”\n\n“If so, then the market may be forming a bottom,” Yardeni said.\n\nThe last time the S&P 500 entered a correction was in 2023, when it fell from a peak on July 31 to a bottom on October 27. After hitting a bottom, the S&P 500 recovered swiftly in just 24 days.\n\nAdam Turnquist, chief technical strategist at LPL Financial, said he has been hesitant to call for a swift recovery this year. He said he has not seen the hallmark signs of a recovery, like investors shifting out of defensive stocks and into cyclical stocks.\n\n“It’s still very defensive right now, which gave us pause in terms of calling for any type of V-shaped recovery,” he said. “In terms of history, more often than not, you tend to retest the lows.”\n\nTurnquist said it seems like “peak fear” has passed, which could be a good sign for momentum. The CBOE Volatility Index, or Wall Street’s fear gauge, hit its highest level this year on April 8. CNN’s Fear and Greed index also slumped to its lowest level this year on April 8.\n\n“What comes next is a grind sideways as we need to build a base to begin the next leg up,” said Kim Abmeyer, a certified financial planner and founder of Abmeyer Wealth Management.\n\nLarry Tentarelli, founder of Blue Chip Daily Trend Report, said in a Wednesday note that the “key range levels” for the S&P 500 are 5,100 and 5,500. At Wednesday’s close, the index stood right in the middle at 5,376.\n\n“Whichever level breaks first on a closing basis will likely signal the next leg of this move,” Tentarelli said.\n\nThere has also been pervasive bearish sentiment in the market, which can be a buying signal. The latest survey from the American Association of Individual Investors showed that for the past eight weeks, more than 50% of respondents have been bearish on the US stock market.\n\nYet there are less optimistic signs, too. The S&P 500 on April 14 experienced what Wall Street calls a “death cross,” when the index’s 50-day moving average closed below its 200-day moving average. That can be a sign of more selling to come, according to Stovall.\n\nIt is incredibly difficult to pinpoint a market bottom in the midst of a slump. What matters for investors is being patient and having a plan, according to Yusuf Abugideiri, a certified financial planner and chief investment officer at Yeske Buie.\n\n“The patient, disciplined, policy-based investor ultimately is going to be rewarded over the long run,” Abugideiri said. “That’s the way the market makes you work for the returns. You’ve got to be patient; you’ve got to be disciplined.”\n\nYounger investors with long-term goals should see a market correction as a buying opportunity while stocks are on sale, he said. Meanwhile, if you are approaching retirement, diversifying your portfolio into more Treasuries and cash equivalents like money market funds can help protect your investments.\n\nWhile a variety of factors influence finding a bottom, Abugideiri said, the outlook for the market largely hinges on investors getting more clarity from the White House.\n\n“If investors get more clarity and have to deal with less uncertainty, markets are going to react favorably,” Abugideiri said.', 'Four months to bottom, historically', 'Published 5:00 AM EDT, Thu April 24, 2025', 'has-the-stock-market-hit-bottom-history-is-a-guide-1745807994'),

And risks to the global economy are “firmly tilted to the downside,” it added.\n\nTrump’s new tariffs account for almost half of the sharp downgrade in the IMF’s US growth forecast for this year, Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, the IMF’s chief economist, wrote in a blog post, noting that uncertainty over policy dented demand in the US even before the recent tariff announcements.\n\nNorth America, just like all regions, can’t expect any upside from the tariffs further down the line. “The long-term impact of the tariffs, if they are maintained, (will be) negative for all regions, just like the short-term impacts,” Gourinchas told reporters Tuesday.\n\nGourinchas also said that “central bank independence remains a cornerstone.” The comment comes just a day after Trump attacked US Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell as a “major loser,” part of his continuing campaign to pressure the central bank chief to cut interest rates.\n\nLowering borrowing costs at this point would risk pushing up US inflation, which is still running above the Fed’s 2% target and is likely to rise further because of Trump’s tariffs, according to many forecasters.\n\nThe IMF has grown gloomier on US prices and now sees inflation hitting 3% this year, compared with its January forecast of 2%.\n\nThe latest World Economic Outlook was put together under “exceptional” circumstances, the IMF said. Trump’s unveiling of sweeping tariffs on April 2 “forced us to jettison our projections — nearly finalized at that point,” it wrote.\n\nSimilarly, Gourinchas told reporters: “We’re entering a new era as the global economic system that has operated for the last 80 years is being reset.”\n\nUnderscoring the importance of trade to the economic outlook, the IMF said in its report that a ratcheting up of trade tensions, along with even more questions about where trade policies are headed, could further reduce growth, whereas “de-escalation from current tariff rates and new agreements providing clarity and stability in trade policies” could do the opposite.\n\nIn an interview, Christine Lagarde, president of the European Central Bank, voiced a similar view of trade. “Free trade has always enhanced the overall growth, has been a serious contributor to the development of all economies,” she told CNBC Tuesday.\n\nShe said higher tariffs will have a negative impact on Europe’s economic growth, although she doesn’t expect a recession in the 20 countries that use the euro.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional information.

CEOs have slashed guidance and Wall Street banks have cut their year-end targets for the S&P 500.\n\nBank of America’s latest global fund manager survey showed the largest number of global investors on record intending to decrease their holdings of US stocks since data collection began in 2001. Seventy-three percent of respondents said they think US exceptionalism has peaked.\n\nThe Trump administration’s trade policy has raised concerns about US economic growth and caused global investors to rethink their allocation to US assets, Arun Sai, senior multi-asset strategist at Pictet Asset Management, told CNN.\n\n“Even if there is a steady de-escalation from here, the damage is done,” Sai said. “There is no putting the genie back in the bottle.”\n\nThe US stock market has long been the gold standard. The S&P 500 has steadily outperformed its counterparts in Europe and Asia for the past 15 years, according to FactSet data.\n\nYet the S&P 500 is down 10% this year and on track for its worst month since 2022. Investors are well aware that the landscape has changed tremendously since the benchmark index soared 23% across last year.\n\nThere have been three catalysts that have shifted focus away from America and toward investing overseas, according to Alessio de Longis, head of investments and senior portfolio manager at Invesco.\n\nIn January, DeepSeek’s low-cost, ChatGPT-like artificial intelligence model caught Silicon Valley by surprise and challenged the narrative that the US had outright dominance in AI.\n\nIn February, a shift in US foreign policy toward less support for Ukraine spurred defense spending in Germany, a boon for economic growth and investing in Europe.\n\nAnd Trump’s haphazard approach to tariffs in March and April was the third nudge for investors to look at other markets, according to de Longis.\n\n“The relatively erratic and unpredictable communication strategy around tariffs, as well as the initial shock of the amount of tariffs that were being threatened across the world provided another impetus for US underperformance,” de Longis said.\n\nIn the past three months, de Longis said his investment strategy has shifted from overly-focused on US stocks in favor of a balance between US and European stocks.\n\nThe latest survey from the American Association of Individual Investors showed that for the past eight weeks, more than 50% of respondents have been bearish on the US stock market.\n\nJason Blackwell, chief investment strategist at Focus Partners Wealth, said it has likely been 15 years since a client has asked to increase their allocation to international stocks.\n\n“That’s been a pretty consistent call that we’ve gotten over the last couple of weeks,” Blackwell said. “So, there’s definitely interest there again.”\n\nBlackwell said the advent of DeepSeek and the prospects for more growth in Europe caught investors’ attention. “Add in the tariffs on top of that, and add in this de-globalization trend, and I think you had a series of events that really had investors rethinking their international exposures and rebalancing a bit from where they have been over the last 10 years,” he said.\n\nHeading into this year, the US accounted for about 25% of global GDP and 65% of global stock market value, according to Barclays.\n\n“For nigh on 20 years, the US has benefited from almost relentless flows into USD financial assets,” said Ajay Rajadhyaksha, an analyst at Barclays, in a recent note. “Perhaps we were primed for some give-back … and a bunch of things have changed elsewhere.”\n\n“Europe has finally bought in to the idea of large fiscal stimulus,” Rajadhyaksha said. “At least from a narrative standpoint, there seem to be some alternatives for international investors heavily over-exposed to the US.”\n\nRajadhyaksha also said that businesses in China have made “impressive strides” in technology beyond DeepSeek, noting that there have been breakthroughs by Huawei and electric vehicle company BYD, which rivals Tesla in the global market. The Chinese government has also recently embraced its private tech sector.\n\nBank of America’s fund manager survey in April showed 49% of respondents think the global economy is on track for a “hard landing,” up from 11% in March.\n\nGold has soared almost 27% this year, smashing through record highs as investors flock to safe haven assets. The most crowded trade in April was gold, according to Bank of America’s survey, breaking a two-year streak of the most crowded trade being the Magnificent Seven tech stocks.\n\nMeanwhile, the US dollar has broadly weakened this year, a potential sign of waning investor confidence in the US. The US dollar index, which measures the dollar’s strength against six major foreign currencies, recently posted its worst week since 2022. The Euro last week hit its strongest level against the dollar in over three years.\n\n“We have previously argued that exceptional US asset return prospects are responsible for the dollar’s strong valuation,” analysts at Goldman Sachs said in a recent note. “If tariffs weigh on US firms’ profit margins and US consumers’ real incomes, like we think they will, they can erode that exceptionalism and, in turn, crack the central pillar of the strong dollar.”\n\nKrishna Guha, vice chairman at Evercore ISI, said in a note that “recent market action shows a loss of confidence in Trump economic policy,” citing higher Treasury yields and a weaker dollar.\n\nTrump’s yearning for a domestic manufacturing renaissance portends to disrupt the global economy — a deeply intertwined system where the United States has enjoyed the center stage.\n\nThe Trump administration’s adamance on changing the international trading system and global economic order has likely contributed to fewer inflows to US assets, according to Pictet Asset Management’s Sai.\n\nWhile the US stock market remains a viable place to invest for the long term, Sai said, investors are seeking out stocks overseas to diversify their portfolios amid tariff whiplash and broad uncertainty. JP Morgan is forecasting a 60% chance of a global recession this year.\n\n“If you’re a European investor, you will now think twice about allocating strategically to the US,” Sai said. “The S&P 500 is no longer the only game in town.”', 'Global markets in focus', 'Published 5:00 AM EDT, Mon April 21, 2025', 'trumps-trade-war-is-pushing-investors-away-from-america-1745807994'),

A contingent of American Secret Service agents hovered, alert, from a distance. Dignitaries walking past gave the scene wide berth.\n\nStraining to catch a glimpse of what was happening, the visitors saw a remarkable scene unfold: President Donald Trump, knee-to-knee with his Ukrainian counterpart Volodomyr Zelensky, in their first face-to-face meeting since an explosive Oval Office row ended with the Ukrainian’s eviction from the White House 57 days earlier.\n\n“I see him as calmer,” Trump said of Zelensky the next day. “I think he understands the picture. And I think he wants to make a deal.”\n\nSaturday’s meeting underneath the Vatican vaults was a remarkable collision of diplomacy and coincidence, quietly orchestrated by both sides at a moment of reckoning in the three-year-long war, according to multiple American and European officials familiar with the matter.\n\nBehind the scenes, European officials had been encouraging a meeting between the men for days, hopeful an in-person meeting in Rome could prove fruitful at a fraught moment in negotiations to end the war.\n\nTrump’s criticism after the meeting of Russian President Vladimir Putin was his strongest to date, and sparked new hope in Ukraine and beyond that the US leader could be adopting a different approach to a conflict he once promised to end on the first day of his presidency.\n\n“I want him to stop shooting, sit down and sign a deal,” Trump said of Putin on Sunday as he returned to Washington to begin what aides say will be a critical week in determining the future of US-led efforts to broker an end to the war. “We have the confines of a deal, I believe, and I want him to sign it and be done with it and just go back to life.”\n\nWhether Trump maintains the critical approach to Putin is anyone’s guess. History has shown Trump far more conciliatory toward the Kremlin leader, sometimes echoing his talking points.\n\nAnd for all of the Vatican meeting’s symbolism — peace talks inside the marble walls where Pope Francis had once called for peace — it was far from clear afterward what if anything had actually changed in the efforts to end the war.\n\nStill, for a president who said this month he was “not a fan” of Zelensky and accused him of prolonging the invasion of his own country, it was a remarkable shift in blame after the encounter inside St. Peter’s.\n\nIt was a meeting neither side seemed certain would come to pass, and both US and Ukrainian officials were careful not to telegraph any expectations ahead of time. Heading into Rome on Friday, Trump suggested he wouldn’t have time for extensive meetings, and questioned whether it would be quite suitable to engage in foreign policy while honoring the late Pope Francis.\n\nInside the Vatican the next day, as Trump and Zelensky found themselves walking through the building at the same time, it still wasn’t clear to people watching the encounter unfold whether they would in fact sit down for talks.\n\nBut Vatican officials were quick to mobilize, bringing three chairs to a corner of St. Peter’s Basilica where Trump and Zelensky could be sequestered from fellow world leaders and speak in private.\n\nThe third chair was originally intended for a translator, one person familiar with the matter said, seeking to put to rest speculation it could have been meant for French President Emmanuel Macron, who greeted both Trump and Zelensky in the minutes before the huddle began.\n\nMacron had been among the leaders who was hoping Trump and Zelensky would be able to speak directly in Rome. But when it came time for them to sit down, Macron walked away after exchanging words with Trump, leaving the US and Ukrainian leaders to speak directly.\n\n“The thing he was determined to do was to talk to Zelensky face-to-face and talk about how we’re going to get the largest land war in Europe to an end,” US National Security Adviser Mike Waltz, who was in Rome, said on Fox News. “Both sides have to want that.”\n\nWith no aides present, the precise contours of what the two men discussed underneath a massive painting of Jesus’s baptism remain closely held. Only cursory readouts were provided afterward.\n\nBut a day later, Trump told reporters Zelensky had asked him for more weapons, which he said was typical, and said they briefly discussed the issue of Crimea — the peninsula Russia annexed in 2014, which the US would recognize as Russian under an American peace proposal.\n\nIf Zelensky had protested that concession, Trump seemed unmoved.\n\n“I don’t know how you can bring up Crimea,” he said Sunday. “That’s been a long time.”\n\nTrump’s efforts to end the Ukraine war have become a major frustration as he approaches his hundredth day in office. He has told advisers that mediating an end to the conflict is harder than he expected.\n\nSome of Trump’s advisers continue to worry they are wasting their time trying to resolve a conflict that has shown little signs of waning. Trump himself said Sunday he was “surprised and disappointed” that Russia had launched a missile assault on Kyiv as the talks were proceeding, and pondered whether Putin was “tapping” him along.\n\nPerhaps as a way to pressure both sides to reach a deal, Trump’s top diplomat suggested Sunday the end-point in US efforts was approaching.\n\n“This week is going to be really important week in which we have to make a determination about whether this is an endeavor that we want to continue to be involved in, or if it’s time to sort of focus on some other issues that are equally, if not more, important,” US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Sunday on NBC.\n\nYet for all of the difficulties in negotiating a settlement, the meeting Saturday provided at least some hope to Trump and his aides that diplomacy was possible, at least with the Ukrainians.\n\nFor his part, Trump also appeared taken by the grandeur of the setting.\n\n“It was a beautiful meeting,” Trump said in New Jersey. “I’ll tell you it was the nicest office I’ve ever seen.”\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details.', '', 'Updated 8:24 PM EDT, Sun April 27, 2025', 'how-coincidence-and-diplomacy-drove-a-consequential-meeting-between-trump-and-zelensky-inside-st-peters-1745808372'),
(178, 'Ron and Casey DeSantis were plotting a political dynasty in Florida. Then came a scandal', 'https://edition.cnn.com/2025/04/27/politics/ron-casey-desantis-florida-scandal/index.html', 'Steve Contorno', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/c-gettyimages-1258381913.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_833,w_1480,c_fill', 'Florida Governor and 2024 presidential hopeful Ron DeSantis and his wife Casey DeSantis speak to supporters during a campaign stop at The Grove on Augusta in Gilbert, South Carolina, on June 2, 2023.', 'A year after his presidential ambitions collapsed, Gov. Ron DeSantis and his wife Casey can no longer lay claim to the future of the Republican Party. And in Florida, even their present is in jeopardy.\n\nOnce firmly in his corner, many Sunshine State Republicans have lately turned on DeSantis, stymying his agenda and frustrating him to no end. At the same time, Casey DeSantis, long regarded as a political force in her own right, is encountering quiet but firm resistance as she lays the groundwork for a potential run to succeed her husband — a campaign that would pit her against President Donald Trump’s handpicked choice to lead the state, Rep. Byron Donalds.\n\nNow, a funding scandal involving one of Casey’s signature initiatives — a state assistance program known as Hope Florida — is casting a shadow over the governor’s legacy and complicating her political ambitions. Lawmakers spent the spring investigating why $10 million from a state Medicaid settlement was routed to a charity connected to Hope Florida, which then transferred the same amount to two groups that financially backed a DeSantis-led campaign against legalizing recreational marijuana. Key lawmakers have publicly suggested the flow of money appears illegal.\n\nThe couple have fiercely stood by their work and denied wrongdoing. DeSantis this week called the criticism of Hope Florida “all political.” Standing alongside her husband Thursday, Casey DeSantis characterized the program as “a philosophy” that “shows we can help people in need.”\n\nRemarkably, the investigation into Hope Florida was not by Democrats, but by Republicans — a striking sign of DeSantis’ eroding clout in a state capital he once controlled with unchallenged authority. Outside Tallahassee, some of Trump’s staunchest allies in Florida have helped to amplify the controversy to their MAGA followers.\n\nAmid the fallout, the DeSantises have grown increasingly isolated. Donors, fundraisers and operatives are fleeing their orbit, and at the moment, few in Florida politics seem willing to sign up for another campaign with the couple. Multiple people have turned down positions in a potential gubernatorial campaign, according to two sources who remain in contact with the governor’s remaining team.\n\n“These days, I can’t tell the difference between being their friend and their enemy,” a longtime Republican operative once close to the governor told CNN.\n\nEven among their remaining allies, there is a growing sense that Casey shouldn’t announce a bid until the cloud hanging over the couple is lifted, though few people are willing to share those sentiments directly with them. Earlier this year, Ryan Tyson, the pollster for DeSantis’ presidential campaign, gave the couple a blunt assessment of the hurdles Casey would face in trying to extend their political dynasty, according to one of the sources.\n\n“It wasn’t well received,” the person said, “and no one has tried to give them advice since.”\n\nAs they mount a public defense, the couple is also privately engaged in an intensifying lobbying campaign to keep Trump’s involvement in the Florida Republican primary to a minimum. Casey joined Trump for a round of golf and DeSantis was recently spotted playing with the president’s son, Eric, at Trump National Doral Miami. They also recently dined with Trump.\n\nBut soon after these engagements, Donalds accompanied Trump to a UFC event in Florida – a joint appearance that signaled to many that the overtures from Ron and Casey had fallen short.\n\nA visibly exasperated DeSantis, watching Tallahassee allies drift away from him and his legislative priorities, recently asked aloud during a press conference: “Why the hell are they doing this?”\n\nCasey DeSantis launched Hope Florida in 2021 with a mission to wean people off government assistance by connecting them with faith-based and other charitable help in their communities. It quickly became her hallmark project as she built up her profile, regularly distributing novelty checks carrying the state seal and her signature. Eventually, Casey and Ron DeSantis would tout the program in other states as they campaigned for president as a one-two punch in 2023.\n\nAround that time, the Florida Department of Children and Families created the Hope Florida Foundation, a separate nonprofit entity assigned to bolster the state program. In its first year, the foundation raised about $800,000 in donations and awarded only $40,000 in financial assistance, according to a recently released tax return.\n\nLast year, the foundation saw its coffers boom by $10 million. At the time, few people noticed. But a Florida House committee probing the organization discovered the source of the windfall: A state settlement with Centene, a Medicaid contractor that had overbilled Florida and other states. The agreement with Centene included an unusual provision that required the company to donate $10 million to the Hope Florida Foundation.\n\nWithin days of the donation, the foundation awarded two $5 million grants to a pair of political groups, according to documents first reported by the Tampa Bay Times and Miami Herald and provided to CNN by the foundation’s lawyer, Jeff Aaron. The two organizations then sent $8.5 million to Keep Florida Clean, a committee that spearheaded the successful fight last November against a ballot measure that would have amended the state constitution to legalize recreational marijuana.\n\nKeep Florida Clean was operated by James Uthmeier, the governor’s chief of staff at the time who DeSantis later named Florida’s attorney general. Uthmeier has denied any wrongdoing.\n\nAfter the election, campaign finance records show Keep Florida Clean shifted $1.2 million to the Florida Freedom Fund, a political committee controlled by the governor. The committee could ultimately be used to support Casey DeSantis’ political ambitions. A spokesperson for the governor’s political operations did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nState Rep. Alex Andrade, a Republican who led the House investigation, told CNN the money trail “looks very much like wire fraud and money laundering to me.” On Thursday, he announced his committee has concluded its work, but he has publicly encouraged law enforcement agencies to review the committee’s findings.\n\n“I hope @PamBondi is paying attention,” Andrade wrote on X, tagging Trump’s attorney general and former top prosecutor in Florida. Bondi’s office declined to comment.\n\nDeSantis contended at an appearance earlier this month that the $10 million was separate from the state settlement and “kind of like a cherry on top, where they agreed to make an additional contribution.” Bryan Griffin, a spokesman for the governor, argued that neither Ron or Casey DeSantis has a role in the Hope Florida Foundation and said the state program “has been extremely successful and has helped 30,000 Floridians reduce or eliminate reliance on public assistance.”\n\nOther elements of Hope Florida illustrate the coziness between the governor’s political orbit and his wife’s top priority.\n\nThe chairman of the Hope Florida Foundation is Joshua Hay, the CEO of Indelible Solutions, a company that the state has paid tens of millions of dollars since he joined the charity, the Times and Herald reported. His company donated $125,000 to DeSantis’ 2022 reelection. A board member for the foundation, Tina Vidal-Duart, is executive vice president for CDR Enterprises, a consulting company that donated $1 million to a Super PAC that supported DeSantis’ presidential campaign. Her husband Carlos Vidal is the company president and CEO.\n\nSeveral of the foundation’s top donors contributed to DeSantis’ political committee as well, including Centene, according to tax documents and campaign finance records.\n\nAnd then there’s Unite Us, a health technology company hired to build the web-based portal that connects people in need to local services. Unite Us rostered a noteworthy team of lobbyists that included Dane Eagle, DeSantis’ former Secretary of the Florida Department of Economic Opportunity; his former chief of staff Adrian Lukis and former deputy chief of staff Courtney Coppola. Nine days after the state executed the contract with Unite US, DeSantis’ presidential campaign announced Coppola and Eagle would serve on his national finance committee.\n\nThe state awarded the $3.9 million deal to Unite Us despite a track record of supporting initiatives that clashed with DeSantis’ crackdown on progressive priorities, like promoting transgender rights and diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives. The technology company’s positions on those issues could provide Republican foes another attack line against Casey DeSantis tied to Hope Florida.\n\nIn the past, Unite Us had publicly boasted on its website its commitment to diversity in hiring, gender neutral restrooms at its New York and Los Angeles offices and use of gender pronouns on internal communications. Days after Casey DeSantis barnstormed through Iowa in June 2023 sporting a custom-made leather jacket embroidered with the slogan “Where Woke Goes to Die,” Unite Us announced a workplace culture award, noting its DEI efforts and that most of its staff were women, non-binary and minorities.\n\n“In so many organizations, ‘diversity,’ ‘equity,’ and ‘inclusion’ are just big-ticket buzz words,” said a quote on archived web page for Unite Us. “But at Unite Us, diversity, equity, and inclusion are core to our mission.” The webpage no longer appears to be operational.\n\nThe governor’s office said he had no involvement in the awarding of the Unite Us contract. Miguel Nevarez, a spokesman for the Florida Department of Children and Families, said a team of negotiators for the contract unanimously selected Unite Us.\n\nNevarez also noted that DCF has provisions in its contracts “that restricts the use of any state funds for the purpose of promoting, advocating for, or providing training or education on “Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion.” The contract with Unite Us specified that the portal could not “list categories or subcategories related to diversity, equity, or inclusion.”\n\nClose allies of Trump are gleefully watching the funding scandal unfold. Roger Stone, Trump’s longtime political adviser, recently dissected the scandal on his podcast with the help of the Florida Democratic Party leader. Laura Loomer, a deeply devoted Trump ally and a regular DeSantis tormenter, has amplified the developments out of Tallahassee to her 1.6 million followers on X.\n\nFormer Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz, who remains close to Trump and is weighing his own gubernatorial run, has also seized on the controversy through his One America News program.\n\nDeSantis has responded with characteristically aggressive counter attacks and has accused Republican lawmakers of attempting to smear his wife for political gain. He has also sought to fundraise off the controversy, asking donors to send money to his political committee to fight “squishy” House Republicans, according to an email obtained by CNN.\n\n“Some people feel threatened by the first lady. Let’s just be clear about that,” DeSantis said at a press conference earlier this month. “If you’re looking at 2026 and you’ve got some horse, you don’t want her anywhere near that. You’re very worried because she runs circles around their people. Everybody knows that.”\n\nCORRECTION: This story has been updated to clarify the work that Indelible Solutions has done for the state of Florida.', 'A funding controversy', 'Updated 7:49 PM EDT, Sun April 27, 2025', 'ron-and-casey-desantis-were-plotting-a-political-dynasty-in-florida-then-came-a-scandal-1745808372');

Flores-Ruiz was set to be in Dugan’s courtroom for an unrelated case.\n\nDugan allegedly demanded that the agents leave a public hallway in the courthouse and said they required a different type of warrant to make the arrest, according to the documents. She then allegedly directed Flores-Ruiz and his attorney to leave through a “jury door,” which leads to a nonpublic area of the courthouse, court documents say.\n\nColón, a sitting judge, said Dugan’s arrest is an example of the Trump administration wanting the judicial system to “essentially succumb to their power and their policy priorities independent of Constitutional rights and what other rights people have.”\n\n“I think what they want to do is to essentially have the judiciary not only in Wisconsin but the independent judiciaries of the state … essentially succumb to their power and their policy priorities independent of Constitutional rights and what other rights people have,” he said.\n\n“That’s not the way we do business in a democratic, in a democratic country. The reality is we sort out Constitutional rights and we don’t allow anyone including the government, including Mr. Patel, including anyone to have more rights than anybody else,” Colón added, referring to FBI Director Kash Patel, who posted a photo of Dugan handcuffed and being escorted to a vehicle by law enforcement.\n\nColón raised concerns about the impacts of Dugan’s arrest on the court and the people who come there to seek justice.\n\n“What they are essentially is creating is chaos,” Colón said. “I expect less people will appear for their criminal appearances in court. I expect that victims will be afraid to come to court.”\n\nWhen asked by Lah why Americans should care about Dugan’s arrest amid the influx of news coming out of the White House, Colón issued a stark warning on the threat the Trump administration poses to democracy.\n\n“Why should you care?” Colón asked, “Because if our Constitutional structure continues to fray in the way they are intentionally fraying it, we will not have a working democracy.”\n\nCNN’s Hannah Rabinowitz, Michael Williams and Devan Cole contributed to this report.', '', 'Published 2:00 PM EDT, Sun April 27, 2025', 'trump-administration-is-sending-a-message-to-chill-the-judiciary-with-wisconsin-judges-arrest-her-peer-says-1745808372'),

Just 22% say they strongly approve of Trump’s handling of the job, a new low, and about twice as many say they strongly disapprove (45%).\n\nSince March, Trump has seen notable drops in approval from women and Hispanic Americans (down 7 points in each group to 36% among women and 28% among Hispanics). Partisan views of Trump remain broadly polarized, with 86% of Republicans approving and 93% of Democrats disapproving. But among political independents, the president’s approval rating has dipped to 31%, matching his first-term low point with that group and about the same as his standing with them in January 2021.\n\nThe poll finds the president underwater and sinking across nearly all major issues he’s sought to address during his time in office, with the public’s confidence in his ability to handle those issues also on the decline.\n\nTrump’s approval ratings on economic issues have dropped notably since early March as the rollout of his tariff plan led to volatility in the stock market and worries about rising prices. On inflation, approval is down 9 points to 35%, and on tariffs themselves, it’s down 4 points to 35%. His marks for handling the economy are down 5 points to a career low of 39%; he hit his previous low once in his first term and again this March). Only about half (52%) express confidence in his ability to deal with the economy, down 13 points compared with a December CNN poll.\n\n“I’m disappointed. I didn’t vote for him. I was going to give him the benefit of doubt, because I figured, you know, he could do things to help the economy and … further disappointment,” said a 55-year-old Virginia resident who identifies as an independent and participated in the poll. She has worked for the federal government for more than two decades and asked that her name not be used.\n\nFollowing his far-reaching efforts to reshape the federal government’s workforce, Trump has lost ground on approval ratings for managing the federal government (42% approve, down 6 points since March) and only 46% express confidence in him to appoint the best people to office, down 8 points since December. Less than half (43%) see Trump’s actions as a necessary shake-up in Washington, while most (57%) say his approach to the presidency is unnecessarily putting the country at risk.\n\nDerek Steinmetz, a Democrat from Wauwatosa, Wisconsin, said he was most concerned by Trump’s “overarching disregard for the rule, and the norms, and the structure of our government. It was a concern the first term, but it’s much worse this time around because there are fewer guardrails in place.”\n\nTrump’s moves on foreign affairs – which have included a more friendly posture toward Russia in its war with Ukraine and ending many foreign aid programs – are also seeing majority disapproval (39% approve, 60% disapprove). Half say they have a lot or some confidence in his ability to handle foreign affairs, down from 55% before he took office.\n\nEven on immigration, an issue where Trump had outperformed his first-term high by 7 points earlier this year, the poll finds declining approval ratings and diminished confidence in Trump’s actions. Overall, 45% approve now, down 6 points from March, and 53% express confidence in his ability to deal with it, down from 60% in December.\n\nTrump earns narrowly positive ratings on only one issue tested in the poll: his handling of issues related to gender identity and trans people. Overall, 51% approve of his handling of that matter, including 90% of Republicans, 48% of independents and 16% of Democrats.\n\n“I’m actually quite glad he said that there’s only male and female. I was actually quite glad when that came out, when he put that into law, that there’s only male and there’s only female, that there’s no binary, he, she, they. There’s no they,” said Lisa Munson, a Maryland mother-of-three who voted for Trump, when asked what she considers to be Trump’s biggest accomplishment.\n\nTrump’s efforts at shaping arts, culture and American history, though, are far less popular, with 64% considering it inappropriate for him to take actions like seizing control of the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts and seeking changes in exhibits at Smithsonian Institution museums, an effort he delegated in part to Vice President JD Vance.\n\nVance matches Trump’s 41% job approval rating overall in the poll, with 58% disapproving. Neither Trump nor Vance is viewed favorably by most Americans. Just 40% say they have a favorable view of the president and 34% a favorable view of Vance.\n\nOverall, Americans’ confidence in Trump to use the power of the presidency responsibly (46% confident, down 8 points) and to provide real leadership for the country (50% confident, down 9 points) have dropped sharply since December. Trump has issued a slew of executive orders directing changes to government practices and policy that have faced myriad challenges in court.\n\n“I’m not a big fan of these executive orders that Trump and all the other presidents issue constantly. In Trump’s case, I think that he goes overboard on these executive orders, and that’s why a lot of them get shot down by the courts, you don’t have the authority to do that,” said George Mastrodonato, a Trump voter and partially retired lawyer who lives in Santa Fe, New Mexico and participated in the poll.\n\n“I wish he would be a little more discreet and focus on the executive orders that he writes and issues that he could win in court. He seems to be like Yosemite Sam, you know? Blasting off with two guns in both hands, and some of them stick and some of them don’t.”\n\nJust over half of Americans (52%), including majorities of both Democrats and Republicans, say Trump’s second presidency will fundamentally change the country in a lasting way. A little more than a third (36%) say any significant changes Trump makes will fade once he leaves office, and only 12% say Trump’s second term will not result in significant changes to the country.\n\nStill, Americans are closely split on whether Trump has kept important campaign promises. Just shy of half, 48%, say he’s doing a good job of it, 51% a bad job – numbers that closely mirror this point in his first term. A 55% majority say he’s taken at least some actions to effectively address the nation’s problems, though only 28% believe he’s done things that have already started to help address the country’s problems.\n\nMastrodonato, the Trump voter from New Mexico, also largely sees Trump as keeping his promises. “He’s doing what he said he would do. Some of his approaches, I would take a different approach, but, you know, he’s Donald Trump so, he’s going to do whatever he wants to do.”\n\nThe CNN poll was conducted among 1,678 adults nationwide by SSRS from April 17-24, using a combination of online and telephone interviews. The survey samples were originally drawn from two sources – a probability-based online panel and a registration-based sample – and combined. Respondents were initially contacted by mail, phone or email. Results for the full sample have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 2.9 points.\n\nCNN’s Emily R.

Jeff Van Drew walks down the House steps after last votes in the US Capitol on Thursday, March 27.', 'Speaker Mike Johnson’s agenda has been repeatedly seized by a group of GOP hardliners who have used the party’s razor-thin margin in the House to score their own political wins.\n\nNow, Republicans from the party’s center are prepared to try the same.\n\nAs Congress returns Monday to the enormous task of drafting President Donald Trump’s first policy package, Johnson will be hearing an earful from an even larger faction of his conference with big red lines on the bill: the middle. And those GOP centrists insist that unlike in past votes, they won’t be the ones forced to swallow whatever leadership puts to a floor vote.\n\n“There is a strong and loud group of us that are not going to be bullied into supporting something that we don’t agree with,” Rep. Mike Lawler of New York, whose 2022 upset helped propel Republicans into the majority, told CNN. “The only reason we have the gavels is because of folks like me.”\n\nMany of these members — a loose coalition of several dozen centrists, purple seat and pro-governing Republicans — told CNN they are tired of the House GOP’s longtime playbook in which right-wing members have refused to compromise and, in effect, have cornered Johnson into supporting their own ideas. And they say the stakes are even higher now, as Republicans prepare for a potentially difficult 2026 midterm cycle that some already fear could wipe out their House majority.\n\nTheir biggest concern now is preserving benefits for Medicaid, which has become a target of party fiscal hawks as they seek to cut at least $1.5 trillion from government programs — a large chunk of which must come from federal health programs. But the centrists have plenty of other priorities, from federal nutritional programs to state and local tax deductions to clean energy programs — and policy fights are about to come to a head in the House in the next month.\n\nOne centrist — Rep. Jeff Van Drew, a self-described “populist Republican” — is already flexing his political muscle. He’s spoken with Trump about Medicaid four times, including once in recent days. He was also one of 12 members who signed a rare public letter to their leadership demanding that they preserve the health program benefits in a final bill. (Behind the scenes, more members were supportive but decided not to put their names on it, according to three people familiar with the discussions.)\n\nVan Drew said he will not vote for any bill that “cuts eligible recipients — whether they be entities such as hospitals and nursing homes — or human beings” from Medicaid. The New Jersey Republican said a group of right-wing Republicans have repeatedly dictated their own agenda to leadership, but that he and others would not – in this case – accept “business as usual” for the sake of their constituents and their House GOP majority.\n\n“You don’t take stuff away from people who are legally and appropriately receiving it. Don’t do that. That’s bad,” Van Drew said. “If you want to do a one-hour tutorial on how to lose your majority, do that. Go ahead and do that stuff and you can write a game plan on how to lose your majority.”\n\nThe party’s political fault lines on Medicaid are bursting into public view with just weeks to go until Republicans are expected to release their first draft of the plan. The panel charged with finding those savings — the Energy and Commerce Committee — will meet the week of May 5 and the GOP will have to publicly show how they plan to shave $880 billion in their jurisdiction.\n\nFor weeks, GOP lawmakers and senior aides have stressed to party leaders that it would be a terrible idea — both policy-wise and politically — to go after Medicaid, according to multiple people who have been part of the conversations. The program enrolls more than 80 million Americans, including many who voted for Trump. Democrats have already signaled they’ll seek to make it a defining issue of the 2026 midterms.\n\nThe president said in a recent interview with Time magazine that he would veto a bill that cuts Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, and Republicans have argued there are ways to cut hundreds of billions in wasted money on federal health programs without slashing Medicaid benefits – but it remains unclear where those cuts would come from.\n\nTop Republicans believe they have found some politically palatable ways to trim spending — including potential new rules requiring recipients to work to get coverage, rules requiring recipients to reapply every six months to ensure eligibility and tightening existing rules that ban coverage to anyone who is in the country illegally. (One GOP member estimated that those alone could have saved a half-trillion dollars over a decade — but still far short of leadership’s $880 billion goal.)\n\nLast week, Georgia Rep. Austin Scott, however, reignited a political firestorm in the conference when he told Fox News that Republicans are eying big reductions to the federal government’s matching funds to Medicaid, which was expanded in many states under the Affordable Care Act. That was something that many of his colleagues believed had already been ruled out, according to two people briefed on the discussions.\n\n“There have been a gazillion things talked about but with very little specificity. Now is the time in the game for people to actually put proposals on the table,” one GOP member said.\n\nThe difficulty for Republicans on programs like Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, will be finding ways to reduce wasteful spending in these massive federal programs without causing any disruptions to those who rely on those benefits.\n\nSome Republicans are anxiously thinking back to the 2018 midterms, when their party was similarly accused of trying to take away health care for millions.\n\n“We know how the movie ends,” a senior GOP aide said of that election. “We lost 40 seats.”\n\nFor months, Johnson and his leadership team have punted their toughest choices about how to proceed with Trump’s “one big, beautiful bill,” papering over major divisions within their ranks.\n\nNow Johnson and his leadership team are eying a vote on the House’s version of Trump’s agenda as soon as the week of May 19, though few in the party are taking that self-imposed deadline seriously.\n\nBut even if the House can overcome deep party divisions to move this quickly, the Senate is expected to move far slower. And that reality has further stoked anxiety among GOP centrists who do not want to walk the plank on a contentious bill that dies across the Capitol in the Senate.\n\nThe next month in the House will consist of marathon committee meetings and markups to hash out policy — including trillions in tax cuts, massive increases in border and military funding and sharp spending cuts to federal programs.\n\nSo far, GOP leaders have kept any details largely under wraps. That includes another issue that will be critical for Republicans like Lawler and his New York colleagues: the state and local tax deduction issue, known as SALT.\n\nRepublicans from New York, New Jersey, Illinois and California have spent months crafting a compromise to restore a state and local tax deduction that was capped in Trump’s 2017 tax bill. These members are waiting on leaders of the House Ways and Means Committee to present a final proposal on what the change may look like — language that will almost certainly cause headaches within the conservative House Freedom Caucus as well.\n\nMost Republicans in Congress — including those in the GOP controlled Senate — hail from lower-tax states and therefore detest the expensive policy change. House conservatives have balked at some of the proposals in the past to raise the deduction.\n\nBut Republicans like Lawler and fellow New York Rep. Nick LaLota have insisted they will not support a bill that doesn’t include major SALT changes back home.\n\n“I would not have voted for the 2017 tax bill if I were in Congress. It is unreasonable to ask me to lend my vote to extend the status quo,” said LaLota, who won his Long Island seat in 2022.\n\n“At the end of the day, it’s going to take 218 votes in the House. The fact is, with a very slim majority, the majority was delivered by seats like mine,” Lawler added. “We’re not going to do things that harm our districts or our constituents. The fact is, there’s going to need to be compromise along the way.”', 'Medicaid', 'Published 9:00 AM EDT, Sun April 27, 2025', 'gop-centrists-borrow-hardliner-tactics-to-sway-trump-agenda-1745808372'),

They were certain he would finally see the existential danger of slapping punishing tariffs on scores of countries and step back from his potentially catastrophic plan.\n\nInstead, in the 10th week of his new term, the 47th president is leaning into his latest favorite metaphor: that international trade is a high-stakes card game and he is the master strategist. Only he knows which countries hold a strong hand, which do not, and how bets should be placed. And he is laying down a massive wager.\n\n“For decades our country has been looted, pillaged, raped and plundered by nations near and far, both friend and foe alike,” he proclaims to an adoring crowd of Republican VIPs. They have assembled at the White House to celebrate what he calls his “Liberation Day” tariffs. Up at the podium, Trump gleefully displays a chart thick with numbers purporting to show just how much each country will pony up for access to the great American marketplace.\n\nBut experts who have played the trade game much longer quickly call Trump’s big move on the second day of April a fool’s bet — one that could poison US trade relations with those friendly partners he mentioned and open the door for less friendly competitors to capitalize on his misstep. Skeptics say Trump is flirting with the kind of failure that can unwind a presidency.\n\nTrump meets their warnings with a jutted jaw and declarations that he will not blink.\n\nTo understand how Trump came so quickly to such a perilous spot after much talk, many threats and occasional applications of tariffs in much smaller degrees, it’s worth considering what those close to him have said for years. He truly believes the ability to tax imported goods is a near-mythical power to wipe away trade deficits, stop illegal immigration, control trafficking in illicit drugs, and make the world bow to his will. Aside from military force, he seems to see tariffs as the most direct way a president can rule over not just the United States, but everyone, everywhere.\n\n“I always say ‘tariffs’ is the most beautiful word to me in the dictionary,” he said back on Inauguration Day just as he had on the campaign trail, “because tariffs are going to make us rich as hell. It’s going to bring our country’s businesses back that left us.”\n\nIt’s an intriguing claim considering how little good came out of his initial tilt with tariffs. Over the four years of Trump’s first term, he and Chinese President Xi Jinping took turns levying tariffs on pork, solar panels, steel pipes, fruit, nuts, intellectual property, recycled aluminum and more. They eventually worked out an agreement, satisfying Trump’s need to declare himself the master negotiator. But subsequent studies found the promise he extracted for China to buy an additional $200 billion in US goods and services went almost entirely unfulfilled. President Joe Biden maintained those tariffs, but as a practical matter, Trump’s first trade war ended in a draw.\n\nStill, this time around Team Trump insists it is making a bigger, longer play. By squeezing world markets simultaneously, the US will drive other countries away from their protectionist tendencies. Better trade balances will follow. Jobs that once moved away from America to find cheaper labor will come back to avoid higher import fees. Gleaming new factories will spring up like wildflowers. Trump will triumph.\n\n“Remember the armies of millions of millions of human beings screwing in little, little screws to make iPhones? That kind of thing is going to come to America!” Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick says on CBS’ “Face the Nation,” raising the specter of factories full of laborers as a grand vision for the future. But then Lutnick clarifies: Any modern factories will undoubtedly include massive amounts of automation. He’s talking about other, better jobs for the people he says will benefit from Trump’s big tariff gamble. “High school-educated Americans, the core to our workforce, is going to have the greatest resurgence of jobs in the history of America to work on these high-tech factories.”\n\nFor many economists, labor analysts and technology specialists, it is a laughably far-fetched idea. Even if tariffs can offset some of the lower wages elsewhere, big investments in big properties — such as manufacturing plants — take years, even if investors are fully confident in the political stability of the host nation.\n\nWhat’s more, in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, Biden had already boosted American manufacturing jobs to higher levels than Trump ever saw in his first term. Indeed, 20% of domestic factories that are underproducing say a shortage of workers is to blame. By 2033, some researchers say more than half of all new manufacturing jobs in the US could be unfilled.\n\nCNN’s Matt Egan, one of the most astute economic reporters around, spoke to a former Ford executive and came away with a cautionary tale. Even that giant of American auto production “had trouble finding qualified workers to work in their assembly plants,” Egan says. And some of those they did find? “They ended up quitting because they didn’t realize just how difficult the job would be.”\n\nIn a broad sense, Trump is right to say many of America’s once-thriving, old-fashioned factory towns descended into dust and decay in part because other countries used tariffs to protect their manufacturing industries. Some statistics show that most of America’s big trading partners have higher import fees, making US goods more costly and putting US exporters at a disadvantage. But there is precious little evidence to support Trump’s notion that America’s future economic glory will come from pushing its citizens back to assembly lines that, based on his descriptions, often sound like the kind of heavy production of the post-World War II years.\n\nAnd make no mistake: Despite everything Trump says, foreign nations will not pay all these tariffs. Instead, economic analysts overwhelmingly say American consumers will foot most of the monumental bill for what those experts call Trump’s taxes.\n\nPerhaps it should be no surprise then, that within days of Trump’s “Liberation” event, even nominal friends who supported him in the election are skimming wild cards toward the president’s carefully stacked tariff deck.\n\n“We’ve got to become friends with Canada again,” Joe Rogan says on one of the most popular podcasts in the world with millions of listeners per episode. “I can’t believe that there is anti-American and anti-Canadian sentiment going on. This is the dumbest f**king feud.”\n\n“The idea that this is good and makes the American economy inherently stronger is wrongheaded,” conservative commentator Ben Shapiro says to his own vast audience. “Trump’s reciprocal tariffs impose hundreds of billions of dollars in new taxes on Americans without public or congressional input.”\n\nEstimates start appearing in the news about cars costing thousands of dollars more; the price of televisions, bananas, clothing, computers and sporting goods skyrocketing. Considering that voters’ anger over inflation helped propel Trump back to the White House, the idea that he would risk driving prices into the stratosphere with such a big, early move is alarming to even some GOP lawmakers.\n\n“High prices are obviously something no one wants to pay — I understand the concern they have,” Rep. Mike Lawler, a New York Republican, tells CNN while nodding to the hope that other countries might cave to Trump’s demands before the worst hits the home front.\n\nOn the Democratic side, Rep. Morgan McGarvey of Kentucky says the damage is already being done by Trump’s weeks of threatening tariffs, imposing them, then pausing them. “It’s the uncertainty,” McGarvey says. “It’s the on-again, off-again, on-again, off-again. … Our phones are ringing off the hook right now. People see their 401(k)s, they see their college funds for their kids just cratering.”\n\nCNN’s Jamie Gangel sees lawmakers of all stripes looking at the days and weeks ahead and quaking. “They don’t know what Donald Trump is going to wake up and decide.”\n\nThe Yale Budget Lab says Trump’s tariffs will raise costs for the average American family by $3,800 annually. Some analysts picking apart how the administration calculated those retaliatory tariff rates noted the tariff formula released by the White House seemed to bear a strong resemblance to a formula generated by ChatGPT. As if to underscore the administration’s seemingly slapdash approach, the Trump plan is found to include a 10% tariff on some Antarctic islands where there are no people. Only penguins.\n\nBillionaire hedge fund manager Bill Ackman, who backed Trump in the election, posts his concerns online. “By placing massive and disproportionate tariffs on our friends and enemies alike and thereby launching a global economic war,” Ackman writes, “we are in the process of destroying confidence in our country.”\n\nThe metric for fear on Wall Street (there really is such a thing) is pegging at levels not seen since Covid-19 shattered global supply chains. The stock market is splashing red across newscasts, showing $6 trillion in lost value over a week. Respected financial institutions are putting the odds of a recession well above 50%.\n\nEven Elon Musk takes an apparent swing at Trump’s call for a 20% tariff on Europe. The richest man in the world — and a top adviser to the president — tells a right-wing political conference in Italy he’d like to see a “zero tax situation … a free trade zone between Europe and North America.”\n\nA chief architect and defender of Trump’s tariff policy, Peter Navarro, suggests Musk is trying to protect his electric car business. The Tesla CEO calls Navarro a “moron … dumber than a sack of bricks.” Musk will later apologize — to bricks.\n\n“THIS IS AN ECONOMIC REVOLUTION, AND WE WILL WIN,” the president posts on Truth Social, pushing for a rally. At a fundraiser for congressional Republicans, he insists the White House is being flooded with messages from abroad.\n\n“I know what the hell I’m doing,” Trump says, implying that his refusal to give an inch is paying off, as Republican lawmakers keep praising his steel spine. “These countries are calling us up, kissing my a**. They are dying to make a deal,” the leader of the free world says as if he is about to lay his winning hand on the table\n\nLess than 24 hours later, he folds.\n\nThe president imposes a 90-day suspension for many of the tariffs he had declared nonnegotiable. It happens so suddenly that US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer is testifying in a congressional hearing when he hears about the new strategy. Rep. Steven Horsford, a Democrat from Nevada, rips into the White House witness for claiming to know what was happening — and then seeming just as surprised as everyone else. “WTF! Who’s in charge?” Horsford shouts. “There is no strategy! This is amateur hour, and it needs to stop!”\n\nAmid reports that an alarming shift in the bond market — a key pillar of US economic power — is what made Trump retreat, the president’s team insists he did not buckle at all. Although many were praising him hours earlier for refusing to budge on his tariff demands, they are now crowing about his wily genius. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent says this was Trump’s “strategy all along.” Brilliant. The ultimate dealmaker. The praise is unending among Republicans, and the financial markets come surging back for their best day in 16 years.\n\nTrump declares victory.\n\nIn the cold light of morning, reality returns. Commentators outside the MAGA echo sphere start saying all Trump did was push the world dangerously close to an economic disaster and then proclaim himself a hero for backing away from the calamity he created. The prediction of the Yale Budget Lab adjusts upward — now placing the annual tariff tax on families at $4,700. To make matters worse, some analysts say Trump’s brash bet substantially weakened the faith of other nations in the reliability of the US government.\n\n“Biggest winner is China. Hands down.” On the “Pivot” podcast, which scrutinizes the intersection of business, tech and politics, entrepreneur and New York University professor of marketing Scott Galloway pulls no punches. “Every Chinese diplomat and businessman … they’re all working overtime and they’re going to European capitals; they’re going everywhere … and they are saying, ‘You may not agree with us, but you know what? We’re good partners.’”\n\nAnalysts note, through all the ups and downs, the financial markets have still not returned to Inauguration Day levels when all of Trump’s tariff talk was still theory. What’s more, a social media post from Trump saying “this is a great time to buy” a few hours before his about-face brings accusations of illegal insider trading, to which the White House accuses Democrats of playing “partisan games.”\n\nIn addition, when it becomes clear how many tariffs have not been suspended, and how China is now facing at least a whopping 145% fee to send goods into the US, the markets nosedive again.\n\nChina calls Trump’s policies a “joke,” strikes back with its own 125% tariff on US goods, and financial experts refuse to lower their predictions of a possible recession. Indeed, Larry Fink, the CEO of the gargantuan, global investment company BlackRock, says on CNBC in mid-April, “I think we are very close, if not in a recession now.”\n\nTrump says he’s waiting on a call from China to discuss some sort of deal, and White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt says, “He wants consumers to trust in him, and they should trust in him.”\n\nBut it appears they don’t — at least not at the levels they did when voters put him back into office. A University of Michigan study, taken before the tariff uproar, is released and shows consumer sentiment at its second lowest level since 1952 with fears of inflation charging upward. Farmers go back to worrying about what will happen to overseas sales of their crops. Businesspeople return to fretting about rising costs and ebbing sales. Working families brace for it all to come crashing down on their bank accounts.\n\nLess than one hundred days into his second turn at the presidency, Donald Trump has bet the lives and livelihoods of hundreds of millions of Americans on his deep affection for tariffs.\n\nHe has started the most significant trade war in generations.\n\nIt is not clear whether he can end it.\n\nCNN’s Kaanita Iyer contributed to this report.', 'Bigger than Trump’s first trade war', 'Published 8:12 AM EDT, Sun April 27, 2025', 'american-battleground-how-trumps-big-bet-on-tariffs-went-bad-1745808372');

If Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky won’t budge, the US has threatened to withdraw support for Ukraine.\n\nTrump’s top emissary, Steve Witkoff, met in person with Putin Friday in Moscow.\n\nUkrainians have been in talks with Americans and Europeans in London, pursuing their version of a plan, in which a ceasefire would come before any discussion of ceding territory.\n\nTrump and Zelensky will both be at the Pope’s funeral in Rome over the weekend.\n\nWhether there will be a breakthrough for peace, the entire two-tracked process blows up, or inertia sets in and the war continues could become clear in the coming days.\n\nMeanwhile, hostilities continue. A Russian general was killed in a car bomb near Moscow Friday. Russian strikes are still targeting Ukraine’s cities, despite Trump’s admonition to Putin on social media, “Vladimir STOP.”\n\nTrump thinks so.\n\n“Crimea will stay with Russia,” he told Time on April 22. “And Zelensky understands that, and everybody understands that it’s been with them for a long time,” Trump said.\n\nRussia first invaded Crimea in 2014 but despite moral outrage and sanctions, it did not face other consequences like it did later when it tried to invade the rest of Ukraine in 2022. Trump’s proposal for a cease fire seems to start with the idea that Crimea will be controlled by Russia.\n\nZelensky has publicly rejected the idea of ceding Crimea.\n\nBut other key Ukrainians seem to be open to the idea. Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko, a former champion boxer, told the BBC he is not involved in negotiations but that giving up Crimea might be necessary.\n\n“It’s not fair. But for the peace, temporary peace, maybe it can be a solution, temporary,” Klitschko said.\n\nWashington Post columnist David Ignatius argues that if the two sides can get past the Crimea issue, other details could be worked out, including whether European troops will backstop Ukraine’s security, and whether the US will have a presence, perhaps securing and running a nuclear power plant.\n\nCNN’s Nick Paton Walsh isn’t so sure, in large part because it’s not at all clear what Trump wants from Putin and whether Putin will give anything up. He writes:\n\nThe overriding problem is Putin thinks time is on his side and Trump has repeatedly said the clock is ticking. These two contrasting positions will not yield a lasting deal. The Kremlin has perhaps wisely ascertained it can, over months, hive off tiny concessions from the White House, and slowly build a geopolitical picture that is more in its favour. Consider the first 90 days of Trump’s presidency and how far the world has already changed in Moscow’s favour.\n\nRussia violated international law by invading Crimea, as CNN’s Ivana Kottosová writes. Zelensky has so far rejected the idea of ceding Crimea, noting that to do so would violate Ukraine’s Constitution.\n\nIf the US were to recognize Crimea as Russian, it would break America’s word multiple times over.\n\nFrom Kottosová’s report:\n\nRecognizing Crimea as part of Russia would put the Trump administration in breach of the 1994 Budapest Memorandum, in which the US made a commitment to respect Ukraine’s sovereignty and borders, in exchange for Kyiv giving up its nuclear weapons.\n\nIn 2018, during the first Trump administration, then-Secretary of State Mike Pompeo issued a statement reaffirming the US’ refusal to recognize the Kremlin’s claims of sovereignty over Crimea.\n\n“That means that he has basically upended the international order,” retired Col. Cedric Leighton, a CNN military analyst, said on CNN Friday. “In essence, what he’s done is created a situation where we go back to the 19th century, where might makes right, and that is what he wants,” Leighton said, comparing Putin’s actions to the invasion by Nazi Germany of Czechoslovakia in the 1930s.\n\nUkrainians feel Crimea has been part of their country since the fall of the Soviet Union. In the decade-plus since Russia seized it Putin has worked to “Russify” Crimea. There are also resource considerations since Crimea and other contested portions of Ukraine are rich in oil, natural gas and other resources. Finally, Crimea sits on the Black Sea and offers important strategic advantages to Russia.\n\n“What ‘walk away’ means is still a question that no one has really clear insight to,” according to Andrea Kendall-Taylor, a senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security and former US Deputy National Intelligence Officer for Russia and Eurasia.\n\n“Does it just mean that the United States will no longer be engaged in the diplomatic process in trying to end the war? Or does it mean that the United States will actually pack up and go home entirely, including ending any remaining military aid?” she told CNN’s Bianna Golodryga on CNN Max.\n\nUkraine does rely on US support, particularly for air defenses and for intelligence. But it has also built up its own resources and leans on Europe.\n\n“Ukrainians will not stop fighting if the United States packs up its bags and walks away,” Kendall-Taylor said.\n\nIt’s Ukrainian drones that are causing most of the casualties on Russian soldiers at this point, she said. Ukrainians are also producing longer-range drones that can strike within Russia, which means Ukraine may prefer to play for time to “convince Putin that he can’t stay in this conflict indefinitely.”\n\n“Not a lot,” according to Kendall-Taylor. “And that’s exactly why we’ve seen such intransigence on his part in making any progress towards the war.”\n\n“It’s really in his interest to continue with the foot dragging, to try to demonstrate that they (Russia) are playing along so that they can preserve the US-Russia relationship,” she said.\n\n“(Putin’s) preferred outcome would be to preserve that relationship and get the United States to abandon Ukraine,” she said.\n\nMichael Kimmage, a former State Department specialist on Russia and Ukraine who now directs the Kennan Institute at the Wilson Center told me that it already seems unlikely the US Congress will approve more spending to help Ukraine and that Europe, particularly Germany, is moving to step into that void.\n\n“This is profound,” he said of Germany’s pivot to prioritize security in its spending.\n\n“In a way, Trump is radicalizing German foreign policy, and there’s a need to go as fast as possible in the direction of independence (from the US), he said.\n\n“If Germany is going to spend a trillion dollars on defense in the next couple of years, a lot of that is going to go to go to Ukraine, or it’s going to be a backstop to supporting Ukraine.”\n\nBut that’s a pivot that will take time.\n\n“It’s not as if the Germany can fill in on the in the short term for the United States, but it can balance out the erratic and basically anti-Ukraine nature of the Trump presidency,” he said.', 'What’s been happening?', 'Published 9:00 AM EDT, Sat April 26, 2025', 'what-to-know-about-trumps-proposal-to-carve-up-ukraine-1745808372'),

Way more than a $5,000 baby bonus', 'https://edition.cnn.com/2025/04/25/politics/baby-bonus-trump-birth-rate-pronatalism/index.html', 'Zachary B.

Undocumented immigrants, despite having entered the country without authorization, risked everything to live in the US and also represent one answer to the related issues of declining birth rates and having enough workers to fund Social Security in the future.\n\nTrump’s government is also working hard to roll back work-from-home flexibility for federal workers, and sending a message to the private sector in the process. That $5,000 baby bonus idea wouldn’t pay for more than a few months of day care in most of the country.\n\nThose details complicate any Trump administration calls for American women to have more babies.\n\nSimone and Malcolm Collins, pronatalism activists, say they have given the White House ideas for how to encourage Americans to have more kids.\n\nSimone told CNN’s Pamela Brown on Thursday that $5,000 likely wouldn’t be enough to spark a change. Instead, pronatalists like the Collinses want to reset Americans’ priorities to glorify motherhood and encourage young people who are worried about the financial situation to instead get excited about families.\n\n“People are still living with their parents and they don’t have homes and they don’t have families because we’ve prioritized things like: first get educated, first go to college, first get your job, first get your house, first get all these things, and then maybe start dating and get married and have kids,” she said, arguing society is “out of whack.”\n\nPronatalists are having a moment, in part because of the worried-about-humanity musings of tech bros like Elon Musk, who has at least a baker’s dozen of offspring.\n\nCatherine Shoichet, one of the reporters who produced a CNN article about pronatalism earlier this month, flooded my inbox with studies on both sides of the pronatalist movement, but the bottom line is that evidence overwhelmingly shows that government efforts to encourage more babies can be very expensive and rarely work.\n\nBut that doesn’t mean governments shouldn’t try. The US currently spends a lot more money on its aging and retired population through Social Security and Medicare than it does encouraging people to have children.\n\nHow much to worry about the falling US (and worldwide) birthrate is a matter of debate. Some of those most concerned about climate change and resource depletion, for example, may think falling birthrates have more benefits than risks.\n\nCritics of pronatalism also warn that it seems like a potential slippery slope to restricting women’s reproductive choices and forcing people to have children they did not choose. And a lot of smart people think pronatalist predictions of civilization’s imminent collapse are overblown.\n\n“Sounds like a good idea to me,” Trump said when a reporter asked him in the Oval Office about a New York Times report that mentioned the $5,000 proposal, among others. That will encourage supporters of the idea, but it’s far short of an endorsement.\n\nOn Capitol Hill, where lawmakers would have to vote for and figure how to pay for the idea, House Speaker Mike Johnson called the idea “creative,” but his colleagues are spending more time looking at how to slash social spending — on the Medicaid program that insures many young mothers, on food assistance and more — as they look for ways to extend Trump’s first-term tax cuts.\n\nThose tax cuts, by the way, did double, to $2,000, the popular tax credit parents and caregivers can claim for children.\n\nBut Republicans generally opposed a far more generous tax credit for children that was included in a Covid relief bill passed by Democrats during the Biden administration and was made available as a subsidy payment even to parents whose earnings are so low they do not traditionally file tax returns.\n\nThere have been bipartisan proposals to revive that “refundable” tax credit, which was essentially a check to parents, and Vice President JD Vance has endorsed the idea of increasing the annual child tax credit to $5,000, but the White House has not, at least so far.\n\nThat short-term experiment, by essentially paying parents up to $3,600 per child, was credited with lowering the poverty rate for US children. After it lapsed in 2022, the child poverty rate jumped, as CNN’s Tami Luhby wrote at the time.\n\nThere have been other ideas, like efforts to help pay for child care for American kids, that also did not pass through Congress. Sen. Cory Booker, the New Jersey Democrat, suggested “baby bonds” — investments at birth — to help all American kids eventually afford college or buy a home.\n\nThe vast majority of countries in the world offer some kind of paid family leave for new mothers. A number of US states have such programs, but the federal government does not require companies to provide paid family leave and the latest in a long line of efforts to create one during the Biden administration failed.\n\nOther countries, like Italy, Germany and Poland, among others, pay parents to have children.\n\nThere is an “upbringing benefit” in Poland. Hong Kong pays parents $2,500 per child. Hungary, led by Trump’s ally Viktor Orban, offers a $30,000 interest-free loan to young newlyweds that is forgiven if the bride has three children. Germany offers monthly payments to all parents, the “kindergeld,” as well as additional benefits for new parents and tax advantages. Its fertility rate, 1.4 births per woman, is lower than US at 1.6 births per woman and much lower than the 2.1 births per woman needed to keep the population steady.\n\nWhile payments to parents would certainly help shoulder some of the burden of parenthood, there is a lot of worldwide evidence that there’s not much to be done to actually reverse declining birth rates in developed countries.\n\nFor decades, governments actually did things that contributed to declining birth rates. Giving women more access to education, opportunity in the workplace and access to birth control gave them more power over their lives.\n\nThe University of Maryland sociologist Philip Cohen, wrote for The Hill last fall that falling birth rates “swam with the tide of history” and anyone expecting to easily reverse birth rates is unlikely to be satisfied.\n\n“Everything about modern society pushed in the direction of fewer children, culturally and economically,” Cohen argued. “Reversing that tide is not just difficult — it’s impossible. You can’t go back. We may someday achieve a global regime of sustainable birth rates, but that will be part of a new social order yet to be invented.”', 'What are the odds of a baby bonus happening?', 'Published 4:00 AM EDT, Fri April 25, 2025', 'what-would-it-take-to-actually-spark-a-baby-boom-way-more-than-a-5000-baby-bonus-1745808372'),

This stems from Trump’s view of a war in which Kyiv “has no cards to play.”\n\nThe president forcibly denied on Thursday that he has a dog in the fight, saying he was simply motivated by a desire to end a war that has killed thousands of civilians.\n\n“I have no allegiance to anybody. I have allegiance to saving lives, and I want to save a lot of lives, a lot of young people’s — mostly young people,” the president said.\n\nBut the unbalanced nature of the US peace effort can be seen in Trump’s deliberately unspecific language about the conflict and the strange, even bizarre ways that he’s talking about the war.\n\nEarly Thursday morning, Russia shot 70 missiles and launched 145 drones toward Ukraine. Most raced to Kyiv in the most murderous attack on the capital in nine months. At least 12 people were killed and 90 were injured as casualties were trapped under the rubble of residential buildings. The capital’s terrified residents were forced back into their air raid shelters — some taking their small kids and pets with them.\n\nTrump’s response to this resumption of terror? A tepid posting on his Truth Social account that seemed most concerned with when the attacks took place than with the carnage wreaked on defenseless civilians. “I am not happy with the Russian strikes on KYIV. Not necessary, and very bad timing. Vladimir, STOP!” Trump wrote. “Let’s get the Peace Deal DONE!”\n\nThe president expanded on his post during an Oval Office appearance later in the day.\n\n“I didn’t like last night. I wasn’t happy with it, and we’re in the midst of talking peace, and missiles were fired, and I was not happy with it,” Trump said, noticeably using a passive tense and not blaming Putin directly.\n\nAnother US president might have offered condolences to the victims, pointed out that deliberately targeting civilians is a war crime and threatened consequences. But Trump’s response was consistent with his long practice of refusing to connect the results of horrific attacks with the leader who ordered them.\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio, who blasted Putin as a “thug” and a “gangster” during his 2016 presidential campaign, was on the Oval Office sofa Thursday afternoon. He adopted Trump’s obfuscatory tenses in a way that almost implied Russian missiles ended up in Kyiv all by themselves. “What happened last night with those missile strikes should remind everybody why this war needs to end,” Rubio said. “It’s horrible, those missiles landed, but what’s even worse is there are … people that were alive yesterday that are not alive today because this war continues.”\n\nThe administration’s limp language about Putin contrasted with the fierce dressing-down of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in that same Oval Office in March. Trump went after the Ukrainian president again this week after Zelensky ruled out recognizing Russia’s annexation of Crimea.\n\nOn Truth Social, Trump complained about “Inflammatory statements like Zelensky’s that makes it so difficult to settle this War. He has nothing to boast about! The situation for Ukraine is dire — He can have Peace or, he can fight for another three years before losing the whole Country.”\n\nThe contrast in the president’s tone toward the two leaders is remarkable.\n\n“When Zelensky dares to speak the truth, Trump truly slams him,” John Herbst, the former US ambassador to Ukraine told Paula Newton on CNN International. “When Putin murders civilians with ballistic missiles he’s merely corrected. Or slightly chastised.”\n\nTrump got defensive on Thursday, when he was asked what concessions Russia had made in the conflict, compared to his constant pressure on Ukraine.\n\n“Stopping the war, stopping taking the whole country. Pretty big concession,” Trump said.\n\nThis answer betrays a strange misunderstanding of what happened in the war and shows just how comprehensively Trump views the war through Putin’s lens.\n\nThe reason a Russian-backed president is not running Ukraine now is that the country’s armed forces performed a heroic rearguard action that shocked the world at the start of the war and saved the capital. And years of arms and ammunition transfers from the US and its European allies kept it that way.\n\n“It is absolutely no concession,” Oleksandr Merezhko, a member of Ukraine’s parliament, told CNN’s Jim Sciutto on “The Brief.” “From my perspective at least, it is absolutely absurd to say something like that.”\n\nTrump insisted that he’d been plenty tough on Putin — although there’s very little evidence that the Russian leader has paid any price for ignoring Trump’s ceasefire plans and for continuing attacks on civilians as peace talks drag on inconclusively.\n\n“You don’t know what pressure I’m putting on Russia,” he told a reporter. “We’re putting a lot of pressure on Russia, and Russia knows that, and some people that are close to it know or he wouldn’t be talking right now.”\n\nSources familiar with the peace discussions told CNN on Thursday that Trump is privately frustrated with his failure to broker an end to the war. But so far, his impatience hasn’t prompted any efforts to coerce Russia into accepting exceedingly generous terms. Trump could, for instance, rush arms to Ukraine to increase the price of the war for Russia’s forces. He could send Patriot anti-missile systems to Kyiv or provide defense against ballistic missiles. The president could also impose secondary sanctions on nations that continue to buy Russian oil and bankroll its war effort.\n\nBut he’s done none of that.

He’s never still, always on the phone and cranking out deal-after-deal with big business pals.\n\nThe president hoped the first 100 days of his second term would uncork a similar torrent of dealmaking as depicted in the seminal text of Trumpism.\n\nBut Trump has softened his tone on his trade war with China; he blinked over reciprocal tariffs on dozens of other nations; and he is fast losing patience with the Ukraine war, which he had predicted he’d end in 24 hours. Deals are proving more elusive when the stakes are not skyscrapers and casinos but entire economies, the credibility of powerful foreign leaders and national sovereignty.\n\nTrump’s belief that every policy issue is a win-lose proposition has dominated his return to the White House – and has led to some nominal successes.\n\nHe’s worked out, for example, how to use his considerable executive authority as leverage against an adversary. By threatening to cut security clearances, he won concessions from some top law firms. By brandishing billions of dollars in government funding, he flexed power over several top universities. This is all ethically and constitutionally questionable. But it’s all about chalking up “wins.”\n\nTrump’s fellow businessmen understand the game. The president offered an opt-out from 145% Chinese tariffs to iPhones following an “Art of the Deal”-style call with Apple CEO Tim Cook.\n\nBut the president is also finding out that geopolitics and global trade negotiations have little in common with selling a condo.\n\nSo far, the endless stream of stunning trade deals predicted by the president’s staff after he paused many tariffs for 90 days hasn’t materialized.\n\nChina has balked at being bullied.\n\nAnd despite the president’s growing fury, Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky has refused so far to accept onerous US conditions for ending the war started by Russian President Vladimir Putin – who has received no such pressure.\n\nIf Trump does pull a fair peace deal out of the hat in Ukraine, he’ll potentially save tens of thousands of lives and end three years of vicious killing. If he can rebalance US trade with China, he’ll go some way to redressing economic injustices in industrialized regions gutted by globalization.\n\nNone of these initiatives are closed. But they are all testing the core mythology of Trump as dealmaker that is crucial to his political appeal.\n\nHe caricatured his own approach taken to its logical and cruel extremes earlier this year when he suggested moving Gaza’s entire population of more than 2 million people out of the territory devastated by Israel’s war with Hamas. He promised that this feat of ethnic cleansing would allow the US to build the “Riviera of the Middle East” with no thought of the dignity and sovereignty of Palestinians.\n\nNot surprisingly, his hopes for forging Middle East peace have stalled.\n\nChina’s President Xi Jinping doesn’t do diplomacy by phone.\n\nBeijing’s preference for formal, painstaking lower-level talks among officials before presidents meet means Trump’s approach to his China trade war was questionable from the start – as was the idea that Xi would bend following the humiliation of facing 145% tariffs that Trump slapped on Chinese goods. After all, his nationalist political project is based on remaking a world that he regards as unfairly shaped by American power.\n\nAlmost all US presidents over the last 20 years have been frustrated at China’s refusal to open its markets to US products, among other issues, including Chinese intellectual property theft. Intimidating Beijing might have worked 25 years ago. But China is now a superpower. It can hurt the US as much as the US can hurt China.\n\n“I think the Chinese are going to feel vindicated,” Richard Haass, president emeritus of the Council on Foreign Relations told CNN’s Kasie Hunt. “We imposed tariffs on China; China pushed back with large tariffs of their own. It looks to be the United States that is backing down. From China’s point of view, this is how they hoped it would play out.”\n\nBeijing’s refusal to blink was predictable, although the White House, which seems to lack expertise on China, appeared surprised.\n\n“If a negotiated solution is truly what the US wants, it should stop threatening and blackmailing China and seek dialogue based on equality, respect and mutual benefit,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun said Wednesday. “To keep asking for a deal while exerting extreme pressure is not the right way to deal with China and simply will not work.”\n\nTrump’s statements on Tuesday and Wednesday that tariffs wouldn’t stay near 145% and that he wouldn’t play “hardball” with Xi were a clear change of emphasis from a White House that had been demanding a call from the Chinese leader. It comes amid rising political pressure in the US – not least from tanking stock markets destabilized by Trump’s tariff policies, which have crushed the 401(k) pension plans of many Americans. Next year’s midterm elections are already spooking GOP lawmakers. Trump just met with CEOs who warned of supply chain crunches and shortages if China tariffs stay high. And a new Pew Research poll found Wednesday that the president’s approval rating has slumped to 40% — down 7 percentage points since early February.\n\nChina might have learned from the previous episode of Trump’s tariff war, which was marked by an earlier climbdown. Earlier this month, the president paused reciprocal tariffs on dozens of countries only hours after they’d come into force. He admitted he’d been watching alarming developments in the bond market as America’s reputation as a safe investment haven came under severe pressure.\n\nThe White House saved face on that occasion by arguing that scores of nations were lining up with attractive trade deals to bring to the president. But so far, no final agreements have emerged. Genuine trade deals typically take years to negotiate, since they require politicians of all sides to make painful political concessions on issues that often impact powerful constituencies. The US is, for example, insisting that Europe open its markets to US meats from hormone-raised livestock, a concession EU leaders would struggle to impose on their voters.\n\nDespite the evidence of China’s hardline statecraft, Trump still appears convinced that what he calls his “great relationship” with Xi will unlock a deal quickly. “Everything’s active. Everybody wants to be a part of what we’re doing,” he told reporters on Wednesday. Hours later however, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who is being credited with masterminding Trump’s walk back on tariffs laid out a less optimistic timeline for meaningful change in trade with China. He spoke of a “two- to three-year timeline for the full rebalancing” of the relationship – in a scenario that would require Beijing’s cooperation.\n\nThe White House insists that Trump’s policy is working already. It regularly publishes lists of incoming investment to the United States. It’s true that some nations are using such inflows to impress the president. But this might also signal that they think they can buy him off with flashy headlines without fundamentally altering the character of their full trading relationship.\n\nStill, many Trump supporters retain their belief in his mystical dealmaking powers. “Trump is an incredibly strategic negotiator. He’s the best there is, “ former Trump adviser Stephen Moore told CNN’s Brianna Keilar. “Eventually … they (China) will come to the negotiating table and the US will come out ahead in this negotiation because the situation is so unlevel right now.”\n\nTrump’s attempts to impose his vision and will on Ukraine mean that his efforts to forge a peace deal have been as unsuccessful as his trade wars. As with China, some of his approaches appear not to appreciate the political forces acting on foreign leaders.\n\nThe president, for instance, expressed frustration with Zelensky on Wednesday because of his failure to sign up to a US-drafted agreement that appears to lock in many of Russia’s goals while compromising Ukraine’s sovereignty.\n\n“The situation for Ukraine is dire — He can have Peace or, he can fight for another three years before losing the whole Country,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. “We are very close to a Deal, but the man with ‘no cards to play’ should now, finally, GET IT DONE.”\n\nOn Thursday, Trump criticized the Russian president, saying he was “not happy” after Russia launched its deadliest wave of attacks on Kyiv in nine months.\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the president’s “patience is running very thin.” She added, “He needs to see this thing come to an end.”\n\nTrump is angry about Zelensky’s opposition to America’s proposed recognition of Russian sovereignty over Crimea – a region annexed illegally by Putin in 2014.\n\nYuriy Boyechko, CEO of Hope for Ukraine, a nonprofit organization, explained such a move would be politically impossible for Zelensky. “The only way it can be done is through a change of (the) Ukrainian constitution, and to get that done, referendums need to take place; the Ukrainian Parliament has to approve this amendment to the constitution; and (Ukraine’s) highest court has to rectify this before Crimea can be recognized as Russian territory.”\n\nBoyechko added, “Surrendering Ukrainian territory to Russian occupiers will never be ratified by the Ukrainian Parliament and the Ukrainian people will never vote for it.”\n\nThe US approach comes after weeks Trump repeatedly escalated pressure on Ukraine while bringing his plans more closely in line with Russia’s goals, a process accelerated by US envoy Steve Witkoff’s frequent visits to Putin. The administration is also trying to negotiate a deal to exploit Ukraine’s rare earth mineral resources, which critics have likened to economic colonization of a vulnerable nation.\n\nWhile Trump is angry at Ukraine, he’s convinced Putin is ready to deal – despite a lack of evidence that he’d compromise any of his goals to eventually destroy Ukrainian independence.\n\n“I think Russia is ready. I think we have a deal with Russia,” Trump said Wednesday in the Oval Office, once again empathizing with the aggressor rather than the victim of the conflict.\n\nAt the start of “The Art of the Deal,” Trump wrote that while other people paint beautifully or write wonderful poetry, “deals are my art form.”\n\nThe world is wondering whether he’s lost his touch.', 'China and Ukraine resist Trump’s pressure', 'Updated 11:27 AM EDT, Thu April 24, 2025', 'the-art-of-the-deal-meets-global-reality-1745808372'),

Wolf', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/200505140935-what-matters-logo-special-article-page-large-169.png?q=h_50', 'President Donald Trump and Elon Musk depart after looking at Tesla vehicles on the South Lawn of the White House on March 11, in Washington, DC.', 'Elon Musk said two very interesting and contradictory things related to his government employment during a Tesla earnings call Tuesday.\n\nFirst, he suggested that he’s just about done focusing full time on his ad hoc role taking a chainsaw to elements of the federal government with the Department of Government Efficiency.\n\n“Starting next month, May, my time allocation to DOGE will drop significantly,” Musk said during the Tesla call.\n\nThat simple idea — that Musk might spend more time on his actual businesses — was enough to spark a rebound Wednesday in Tesla’s stock price, which had been cratering due in large part to Musk’s polarizing role in Trump’s’ administration.\n\nBut in the next breath Musk implied he wouldn’t be leaving government entirely, and maybe not until 2029, when President Donald Trump’s term is over.\n\n“I’ll have to continue doing it for, I think, probably the remainder of the president’s term, just to make sure that the waste and fraud that we stop does not come roaring back, which will do if it has the chance,” Musk said, adding: “I think I’ll continue to spend a day or two per week on government matters for as long as the president would like me to do so and as long as it is useful.”\n\nWhat exactly does this mean, and what is the legal authority for Musk to remain at the White House?\n\nMusk’s role is already on the edge of what’s officially allowed in Washington. The White House has said he is a “special government employee,” which allowed him, unlike full-time federal workers, to continue making money from the “like 17 jobs” he talks about having. CNN has reported Musk is not getting a paycheck for his government work.\n\nGiving Musk broad authority to oversee DOGE, fire workers and gut agencies across government was always a misapplication of the special government employee law, according to Max Stier, CEO of the Partnership for Public Service.\n\nSpecial government employees are supposed “to bring in specialized, expert skill that you don’t have internal to the government,” he said.\n\nBut the Trump administration, in hiring Musk and others in this way, “misused the purpose of this to walk past a lot of the conflict issues, the clearance issues that you would have in a permanent, full-time employee.”\n\n“There’s no way that Elon Musk should have his hands around the kinds of decision-making that he does on issues that have such hard relevance to his private financial interests,” Stier said.\n\nRather than a successful efficiency operation, Stier argued the DOGE effort has been wasteful. He argued that the firing of IRS employees at tax time will cost the government hundreds of billions of dollars in revenue this year — more than the entire federal payroll.\n\nDOGE has posted claimed cost-cutting on a website, but the figures have been difficult to verify. Musk has previously said he might be able to achieve $1 trillion in savings, but that does not appear to have occurred. And the real impacts on government are not yet known.\n\n“I don’t think we do understand yet the full contours, because it has been an unbelievably nontransparent operation,” Stier said.\n\nThere are rules for special government employees. Most importantly, they are only supposed to work for the US government for 130 days in a 365-day period.\n\nIt’s not clear if Musk’s first day was Inauguration Day on January 20, or later. His position as a special government employee — not a volunteer but not an official government employee — was announced in early February.\n\nIf he technically leaves government service at the end of May, that would be 130 days after January 20, although the reference to “special government employees” in US code suggests they can serve their 130 days intermittently. But Musk specifically did not say he was leaving government service. Instead, he said he will still contribute a portion of his time each week to DOGE and the government even after May.\n\nStier said he would not be surprised if the White House sidesteps rules to keep Musk’s counsel after the law says he should no longer have an official role.\n\n“I don’t think they followed the rules in the way they’ve managed so far,” Stier said, so they likely won’t follow them in the future.\n\nThe White House declined to comment on CNN’s request for more information about what Musk’s role might be after the 130-day limit for special government employees.\n\nThere is some irony in the flexibility Trump is apparently giving Musk, since the administration’s effort to shrink the federal workforce was built on removing flexibility. Workers who had been working from home were required to come back to the office. Trump also complained about government workers who had jobs outside of government in addition to their government work, although he did not provide any evidence.\n\nSpecial government employees are not exactly full-time government employees, although they are expected to adhere to ethics rules for government workers and to file financial disclosures.\n\nThey may or may not be paid, but unlike other government workers there are not limits on their income outside of government as there are for some other government workers, according to a brief from the Office of Government Ethics.\n\nPlus, the Department of Justice has argued in the past that SGEs are subject to the emoluments clause, which means they cannot take payments from foreign governments. If Musk filled out a required financial disclosure, it has not been publicly released, although CNN has documented many ways in which his business interests intersect with his government cutting.\n\nTrump has previously acknowledged Musk would leave his administration this year, but said that the work of DOGE will continue.\n\n“There will be a point where he is gonna have to leave and when he does the secretaries will take totally over and DOGE will stay active,” Trump told reporters on Air Force One in early April. “We have a lot of smart people. A lot of those people I believe are gonna go into the agencies and they’re gonna work on it from the inside.”\n\nMusk is one of many Trump administration officials with multiple jobs. The leader of the Office of Government Ethics, the government agency that might oversee such potential conflicts for special government employees, was fired by Trump shortly after his term began. US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer is currently acting director of the ethics office in addition to his day job managing Trump’s trade negotiations.\n\nCNN’s Kit Maher contributed to this report.', '', 'Published 3:12 PM EDT, Wed April 23, 2025', 'elon-musks-government-role-gets-even-murkier-1745808372');

But as Trump attempts to destroy governing structures at home and abroad, chaos is itself a marker of success.\n\nSo the question, as Trump transitions from the shock-and-awe euphoria start of his second term to grinding out his priorities, becomes what kind of event could cause these two competing realities to collide.\n\nA recession that the president seems determined to talk the country into might puncture the bubble of achievement that the White House aggressively cultivates each day. High prices and job losses, after all, don’t discriminate between Republican and Democratic voters.\n\nOr perhaps it would take a national security crisis precipitated by his volatile leadership and callow foreign policy team to destroy Trump’s presidency. Even then, Trump’s hold on his supporters is so strong, nothing might shake their confidence even if he alienates the middle-ground voters who helped reelect him. This, after all, is a president who convinced millions that the fair election he lost in 2020 was a stitch-up.\n\nStill, if Trump somehow manages to secure a better deal for US manufacturers with his tariff wars, he might justify the mayhem he’s visited on financial markets. If “America first” really does convince Europe to defend itself and the president’s vows to forge peace work, the world may end up safer.\n\nBut hubris is threatening an administration that has made overreaches by previous presidents seem tame by comparison.\n\n“You were overwhelmingly elected by the biggest majority … Americans want you to be president,” Attorney General Pam Bondi gushed to Trump last week during a Cabinet meeting, suggesting the Trump team has misread its supposed mandate.\n\nTrump’s victory, while clear, was not a landslide. Together with a tiny GOP majority in the House, it’s a thin political platform on which to base an attempt to simultaneously remake the global geopolitical system and the world trading paradigm; to transform the US government; and to destroy elite establishment centers of power.\n\nWeeks ago, the Washington narrative was that Trump’s second-term team would be more disciplined and unified than his first. But that’s looking increasingly threadbare. The president badly needs some swift wins – not just those that reward his MAGA base – to sustain his credibility.\n\nA sense of disorder is mounting.\n\n— Backbiting and organizational chaos at the Pentagon came after Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth confirmed fears about his fitness for the job by posting details of military strikes in Yemen on two Signal chats.\n\n— Trump’s trade wars have wiped trillions off global stock markets and are likely soon to hike prices for inflation-weary US shoppers. His threats against Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell have shattered investor confidence. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is heading to its worst April since the Great Depression. And amazingly, the world is wondering whether the dollar is a haven anymore. All of this may be behind an apparent and emerging climbdown that the administration signaled on Tuesday on the China tariffs and Trump’s warnings that he might fire the central bank chief.\n\n— His purge of first-term officials who knew how Washington worked is resulting in embarrassing accidents. An undocumented migrant from Maryland was deported by mistake to El Salvador, igniting a massive legal showdown. And the administration set off a feud with Harvard University, apparently by mistake.\n\n— Trump’s claims that the force of his personality alone would end wars made him look foolish. His Ukraine peace effort looks amateur. Carnage is still raging in Gaza. He’s destroyed America’s closest diplomatic friendship, with Canada, with unhinged demands it become the 51st state. His bullying means many tourists are staying away, frightened by potential harassment at US borders. Allies are making alternative arrangements, thereby diminishing American power.\n\n— There has been no blizzard of lawmaking to bolster Trump’s claims he’s had the most successful first 100 days in generations. How Republicans will pass his huge tax plan is unclear. And a future Democratic president could wipe out his multitudes of executive orders with a stroke of their own pen.\n\n— Tax season at the Internal Revenue Service was marked by dysfunction, with a revolving door of acting commissioners at the key agency.\n\n— Elon Musk’s evisceration of the US government may be setting up a series of disasters that are not yet evident. Massive funding cuts may gut US emergency preparedness as hurricane season approaches. Canceled health research on diseases like cancer may cause unnecessary deaths in years to come. The mistaken firing and hurried rehiring of technicians who look after nuclear weapons seems like an emblem of the Tesla chief’s tenure in Washington, which he said on Tuesday he’d soon begin to scale back.\n\n— And Trump’s incessant demands for more power have pushed the United States to the brink of one of the worst constitutional crises in 250 years. The forest of legal challenges has also severely disrupted many of the administration’s top priorities, including its signature mass deportation program.\n\nThe White House, however, insists that such damning assessments do not recognize what it regards as a spectacular record of success.\n\nAnd while Trump world’s creation of alternative facts has reached stunning new heights in his second term, there is some logic to their arguments.\n\nThe president has never made much pretense of governing for the entire country. His presidencies have been a long succession of attempts to gratify his political base.\n\nThat lens is the best way to understand his second term.\n\nMusk’s Department of Government Efficiency is the culmination of decades of conservative hopes to dismantle the mighty federal machine. This is not just an ideological goal, although hostility to government is one of the few common themes of two great GOP codes, Reaganism and Trumpism. Many Republican officials believe that the civil service has always been a liberal check on their presidents’ power. And if attempts to shatter that stranglehold don’t ultimately result in the full dismantling of what Trump first-term political guru Steve Bannon calls the administrative state, then paralyzing government might work almost as well. It’s going to be all but impossible for a future Democratic president to quickly rebuild what Musk has destroyed.\n\nTrump’s belief in almost absolute presidential power horrifies his critics. But millions of Americans voted for this. He made no secret on the campaign trail of his intention to weaponize presidential power and the Justice Department to pursue his enemies. “It’s good to have a strong man at the head of a country,” Trump reflected during a campaign appearance in early 2024, in remarks that explain his domestic and foreign policies.\n\nOne of the most controversial aspects of that vision is playing out in the deportations of undocumented migrants to a notorious prison in El Salvador, including that of Kilmar Abrego Garcia.\n\nBut the White House loves the fight. It’s failed to prove Abrego Garcia is a terrorist and a gang member. But White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt stoked the fire again on Tuesday. “We were always right. The president was always on the right side of this issue to deport this illegal criminal from our community.” When Trump said last week that he’d like to deport US citizen criminals to El Salvador, he knew his audience. And on this immigration issue, he has some genuine results to show for his efforts. Border crossings are down significantly compared with the days of the Biden administration.\n\nTrump’s tariff wars seem insane to Wall Street investors and middle-class Americans who’ve seen their 401(k) plans plummet. But the Trump administration is betting on a different audience – working Americans in rural areas and states devastated by globalization who helped elect him twice. “We shipped countless jobs overseas and, with them, our capacity to make things – from furniture, appliances, and even weapons of war,” Vice President JD Vance said in India on Tuesday. He added: “Many were proud of where they came from: their way of life, the kind of jobs they worked, and the kind of jobs their parents worked before them.”\n\nTrump’s America first creed horrifies the foreign policy establishment and threatens to undo generations of US leadership. But those are the same experts who ran the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and are reviled by Trump’s base. America’s reputation abroad is being slammed by Trump’s dismantling of USAID, genuflection to Russian President Vladimir Putin and abandonment of Africa. But Trump and his supporters care little for allies. He’d rather be feared than liked.\n\nA veteran of those early 21st-century wars, Hegseth now runs the Pentagon. His defenestration of senior uniformed officers who advocated diversity might be unfairly wrecking military careers and rocking the leadership of the world’s most lethal military. But the former Fox News anchor has the support of conservative media – one reason Trump is standing by him despite reports of his cavalier attitude to classified information. Leavitt hinted at the strategy behind Hegseth’s selection and retention on Tuesday, saying, “There’s a lot of people in this city who reject monumental change, and I think, frankly, that’s why we’ve seen a smear campaign against the secretary of defense since the moment that President Trump announced his nomination before the United States Senate.”\n\nA similar distaste for the establishment also explains Trump’s showdown with Harvard. It might have been mistakenly started, but the clash is exactly the kind of issue the White House seeks – placing Trump on the side of the overwhelming majority of Americans who didn’t attend Ivy League colleges. If Democrats chose to defend these bastions of elitism, so much the better for Trump’s political cause.\n\nHistory will form its own judgments on the second term of Trump. But as the daily pandemonium unfolds, it’s worth remembering that this divisive presidency can look like a dangerous failure to half the country while manifesting as a stunning success to the other half.\n\nIf America was ever united by a common version of reality, that’s no longer the case.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments.', 'Chaos grows the longer Trump is in power', 'Updated 9:24 AM EDT, Wed April 23, 2025', 'how-trumps-presidency-can-be-a-colossal-failure-and-stunning-success-all-at-once-1745808372'),

The Supreme Court ruled the White House must “facilitate” the return of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, but the White House has made no real effort to bring him back to the US.\n\nIt was the mistaken addition of a reporter to a Signal chat by Trump’s national security adviser that first uncovered the sharing of sensitive information by his Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth.\n\nThe Signal chat mistake seemed to have blown over, but then drama returned to the Pentagon with a purge of Hegseth loyalists still new in their jobs. Now there are reports that Hegseth had shared sensitive information in a second Signal chat.\n\nIt was the sending of a letter, perhaps by mistake, that kicked off a legal fight with Harvard.\n\nThat most recent incident, reported by The New York Times, is not something the White House has acknowledged as an error, but administration officials have said the letter did not achieve its original goal, which apparently was not for Harvard to file a lawsuit against Trump’s administration.\n\n“It was a letter that was intended to have both parties sit down again and continue their negotiations,” Education Secretary Linda McMahon said on CNBC Tuesday.\n\nThe letter, which was signed by three different government officials, was legitimate, but maybe sent too soon.\n\nThere have been multiple acting IRS commissioners in less than 100 days of Trump’s second administration. Some quit in protest when the administration decided to give tax data to immigration officials. The most recent acting commissioner to leave, Gary Shapley, was a whistleblower at the IRS and alleged the Justice Department slow-walked an investigation of President Joe Biden’s son Hunter. Shapley was out within a few days, apparently after Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent complained about being cut out of the process.\n\nIt was not a mistake when Trump announced retaliatory tariffs, which have since been paused for all countries but China. But the large board Trump used to argue his case included wild figures that confused economists.\n\nMarkets responded favorably Tuesday after the Wall Street Journal reported Bessent told investors he believes the trade war with China will “de-escalate.”\n\nThe White House also sought to reassure Wall Street and Americans when press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters at a White House press briefing Tuesday that the administration has made progress in reaching the outlines of new trade agreements with 18 countries. It’s not clear when any new deals might be finalized.\n\nSen. John Kennedy, the Louisiana Republican, gave the administration some backhanded support on “Meet the Press” Sunday when he said the mistaken deportation of Abrego Garcia was a “screwup” but did not represent a pattern of mistaken deportations.\n\nThere is clearly an emerging pattern of unforced errors that are complicating Trump’s already controversial and divisive policies.\n\nThe Abrego Garcia case humanized the mass deportation effort, even if he currently seems unlikely ever to return to the US.\n\nHegseth’s Signal problem and the merry-go-round of acting IRS commissioners highlight that Trump brought in outsiders to disrupt the federal bureaucracy.\n\nHarvard’s lawsuit is being cheered by those who fear the impacts of Trump’s effort to cut research funding and strong-arm universities to cut down on campus protests and chill dissent.\n\nMistakes are built into the DNA of the ad hoc Department of Government Efficiency led by Elon Musk.\n\n“Nobody’s going to bat a thousand,” Musk said in the Oval Office in February.\n\n“We will make mistakes, but we will act quickly to correct any mistakes.”\n\nMusk admitted to at least one. “One of the things we accidentally canceled, very briefly, was Ebola prevention. I think we all want Ebola prevention,” he said at a Cabinet meeting, although independent reports have questioned whether the aid is in fact flowing again.\n\nMusk did not acknowledge other DOGE mistakes, like the firing and then rehiring of government workers focused on nuclear safety in Texas and power grid security in the Pacific Northwest.\n\nOther workers appeared to be fired indiscriminately, but were told it was because of their performance. After a decision by a judge in California, they may now be re-fired. Trump’s efforts to shrink the government are not over; there is an expectation that multiple agencies will continue with “reduction in force” efforts to further cull the number of federal workers.\n\nIt’s ultimately what the administration does on purpose that might worry Trump’s critics more than a perception of sloppiness.\n\nHere are a few CNN reports from recent days:\n\nThe administration appears to have minimized federal climate scientists’ findings of record carbon dioxide growth in the atmosphere, for instance.\n\nTrump’s budget proposal targets Head Start and home heating oil programs that could hurt American children and seniors who need assistance.\n\nAt a time when disaster relief money is stalled, the Trump administration sped money to GOP-led states, according to another CNN report.', 'Second Signal snafu', 'Updated 6:19 PM EDT, Tue April 22, 2025', 'in-trump-20-the-mistakes-are-multiplying-1745808372'),

The phrase “serving at the pleasure of the president” feels particularly apt given the capricious nature of this commander in chief.\n\nBut firing Hegseth three months into a tenure that started with national security experts warning he was dangerously unprepared to lead the Pentagon would force an embarrassed Trump to admit he’d made a mistake.\n\nAnd, critically, Hegseth has not yet committed the unpardonable transgression that led to the departure of two Trump first-term defense secretaries – trying to thwart the president. The first, retired Marine Gen. James Mattis, fought a long battle to rein in the president’s “America first” foreign policy instincts. The final straw came when Trump demanded the withdrawal of US troops from Syria. Another former defense secretary, Mark Esper, wrote his resignation letter months before a departure that was made inevitable when he publicly said he’d oppose the use of troops to quell domestic political protests.\n\nFresh drama around Hegseth is another reminder that 47th president’s orbit doesn’t follow the rules of normal administrations, in which the breach of sensitive information would be a career-ending disgrace.\n\nThose ejected from the chaotic Trump political inner circle, by contrast, usually committed a transgression that offends or contradicts the president himself.\n\nThe latest controversy concerns detailed plans about a military operation against the Houthis in Yemen that were shared on a second Signal group chat. This one was on the former Fox News anchor’s personal phone and included his wife, lawyer and brother, three people familiar with the chat told CNN. The chat was set up during Hegseth’s confirmation hearing process, two of those familiar with the matter said. But Hegseth continued using the chat to communicate after he was confirmed, the sources said.\n\nAs a national security matter, Hegseth’s lack of discretion mocks the standards and laws that his civilian and military subordinates must follow. It’s even possible that active-duty US personnel engaged in strikes against the Iran-backed militants in Yemen might have been put at risk.\n\nIf Hegseth’s alarmingly cavalier approach – which could leave conversations about military operations sensitive to penetration by hostile intelligence agencies – had caused a military disaster, Trump would have no option but to act. That point has not yet been reached. But if his stewardship of the military as a whole reflects his carelessness so far, alarm will mount about the quality of advice reaching the president.\n\nThere will also be questions of morale and the defense secretary’s authority, since lower-level staffers or military personnel would almost certainly face discipline, dismissal or even prosecution for such lax handling of sensitive material.\n\nNews of the second Signal chat came as some of Hegseth’s closest former advisers issued warnings about turmoil at the Pentagon. They included his former spokesman John Ullyot and three former senior officials Hegseth fired last week – top adviser Dan Caldwell; deputy chief of staff Darin Selnick; and Colin Carroll, who was chief of staff to the deputy secretary of defense.\n\n“It’s been a month of total chaos at the Pentagon. From leaks of sensitive operational plans to mass firings, the dysfunction is now a major distraction for the president — who deserves better from his senior leadership,” Ullyot said in a statement obtained by CNN. Ullyot also wrote a Politico op-ed.\n\nSigns of disorder at the Pentagon are especially worrying, since they are building at a moment when sober, careful leadership of the world’s most lethal military seems more important than ever.\n\nThe administration’s effort – for example – to try to end the war provoked when Russia, the world’s largest nuclear power, invaded Ukraine appear to be reaching a make-or-break point and could cause unpredictable geopolitical consequences. Trump’s team is in the middle of critical nuclear talks with Iran. If they fail, the president will face a fateful choice over whether to launch risky military strikes to thwart the Islamic Republic’s alleged pursuit of a nuclear weapon. And the president’s wild tariff war sharpened an already simmering standoff with China. Even a minor incident between forces in close quarters in tense East Asian waters could trigger a superpower conflict.\n\nAs is often the case, the dynamics at play in the new Hegseth crisis were laid bare in the administration’s public statements.\n\nThe secretary of defense displayed the pugilism that convinced Trump he was the man to carry out an “anti-woke” purge at the Pentagon in the incongruous setting of the White House South Lawn, where hundreds and kids and families enjoyed the annual Easter Egg Roll.\n\nHegseth slammed the “fake news” media, anonymous sources and “hoaxsters,” who he claimed concocted the new story to distract from his MAGA revolution across the river at US military headquarters to put “the Pentagon back in the hands of war fighters.” Looking directly into the camera, like he once did on “Fox and Friends,” he complained, “This is what the media does. They take anonymous sources, disgruntled former employees and they try to slash and burn people and ruin their reputations.”\n\nThis is classic Trumpian practice: deflecting a damaging controversy by creating a new fight with forces despised by the MAGA base and claiming any criticism is motivated by swampy forces opposed to the revolution.\n\nTrump came to Hegseth’s aid at the same event, having spoken with the defense secretary after the story was first reported by The New York Times on Sunday.\n\n“Pete’s doing a great job. Everybody’s happy with him,” Trump said. “It’s just fake news. They just make up stories. I guess it’s – sounds like disgruntled employees. He was put there to get rid of a lot of bad people, and that’s what he’s doing. You don’t always have friends when you do that.”\n\nTrump’s stance showed he is loath to hand what his staffers would regard as a victory to journalists, whom they regard as adversaries in a bitter struggle.\n\nThis was not the first time the president has rescued Hegseth’s nascent political career. Trump strongly backed his then-nominee when his confirmation prospects were rocked by allegations related to drinking and sexual misconduct, which Hegseth denied, late last year. Many Washington pundits thought the nomination was toast. But the president’s refusal to lose Hegseth, an Iraq and Afghanistan war veteran, was picked up by conservative media and activists who launched a fierce support campaign. The pressure forced several Republican senators who had reservations about Hegseth to move into line.\n\nThere’s no sign yet that support for Hegseth is beginning to crack again on Capitol Hill. But Republican senators were no doubt grateful for the Easter recess that had them back in their districts and away from Washington media.\n\nThere were some signs of disquiet, however.\n\nFlorida GOP Rep. Carlos Giménez told CNN’s Pamela Brown that the new allegations around Hegseth “should be a lesson to everybody” in the administration. “A lot of the federal agencies use Signal because it’s supposed to be an encrypted, very secure application. The fact that these things are being leaked now call into question how secure Signal really is,” Giminez said. But he did not weigh in on Hegseth’s fate.\n\nIn Trump’s world, everything revolves around leverage and loyalty. And the latest Hegseth scandal suggests he will be left in even greater debt to the president. He will presumably be even more keen to do whatever the president wants. So Trump may enjoy having him around a bit longer.\n\nBut even Trump might be forced to rethink if it emerged that Hegseth continued to post sensitive military details on messaging apps after the first Signal storm was reported by the Atlantic.\n\nThere’s one other rule from the president’s first term that might apply. Every under-fire subordinate has Trump’s confidence – right up until the moment they don’t.', 'New questions raised about Hegseth’s approach', 'Updated 5:08 AM EDT, Tue April 22, 2025', 'why-hegseth-looks-safe-for-now-despite-new-group-chat-crisis-1745808372'),

But officials are refusing to return Abrego Garcia to the US, arguing they lack power to force El Salvador to do so.\n\nOfficials are also choosing to interpret the Supreme Court’s ruling that the Trump administration must “facilitate” his return as a unanimous endorsement of the administration’s position. They argue that because Abrego Garcia is in the custody of a foreign government, they have no power to return him.\n\nThe White House insists Abrego Garcia is a terrorist; a member of the notorious MS-13 gang, who will never be brought back to the US. But it has failed to produce definitive evidence to prove these claims. It has instead been maligning Abrego Garcia’s character by highlighting a domestic dispute with his US-born wife and a claim he was involved in human trafficking. But Abrego Garcia was not prosecuted in either case, and his wife has dismissed the allegations against him.\n\nMaryland Sen. Chris Van Hollen visited El Salvador last week. Abrego Garcia was brought out of custody to meet him, wearing civilian clothes, in a photo op apparently staged by the Trump-allied government to embarrass the visiting Democrat.\n\n“The subject at hand is that he and his administration are defying a court order to give Abrego Garcia his due process rights,” Van Hollen told CNN’s Dana Bash on “State of the Union” on Sunday. “They need to put up or shut up in the courts.” The senator argued the case proved America has a “lawless president who is ignoring the order of the Supreme Court of the United States to facilitate his return.”\n\nDemocrats, hurt by former President Joe Biden’s long refusal to admit a crisis at the southern border, have recently struggled to handle immigration politics. And the Trump administration has sought to exploit the Abrego Garcia matter to force his defenders to line up against its hardline stance, which it believes is politically beneficial.\n\nBut Van Hollen said the issues go far beyond one individual’s plight and get to the fundamental question of presidential power, where Trump is pushing and potentially exceeding the legal limits on issues beyond immigration. Van Hollen argued the president is using the scourge of gang violence to justify bypassing legal safeguards. Asked by Bash whether he would be OK if Abrego Garcia was eventually deported, given his undocumented status, Van Hollen replied: “I’m OK with whatever the law dictates.”\n\nVan Hollen has been heatedly attacked by Trump and the White House over his visit. The president called him a “fool,” and the case has prompted some Democrats, including California Gov. Gavin Newsom, to suggest the party would be better off hammering Trump on the economy, an issue that may matter more to voters. But Van Hollen defended his stance. He told CNN’s Bash, “I don’t think it’s ever wrong to fight for the constitutional rights of one person, because if we give up on one person’s rights, we threaten everybody’s rights.”\n\nThe Trump administration’s border czar, Tom Homan, however, refused to give any ground on the case — which has become an acid test of the administration’s broader immigration approach. After all, if Abrego Garcia is returned, questions will be raised about the status of hundreds of other undocumented migrants the administration claims are terrorists and gang members who were shipped to a notorious prison in El Salvador. And the Trump administration would be tacitly admitting the courts had jurisdiction over its conduct.\n\n“We removed a public safety threat, a national security threat, a violent gang member from the United States,” Homan said Sunday on ABC News’ “This Week.”\n\n“ICE intelligence says he’s an MS-13 gang member. Confidential information says he’s an MS-13 gang member. The country of El Salvador says he’s an MS-13 gang member. I think he’s exactly where he should be.”\n\nThe Trump administration’s mass deportation program — a centerpiece of the president’s 2024 election campaign — is now embroiled in multiple legal challenges.\n\nIt seems inevitable that the policies, which have already landed before the Supreme Court, will return there for final adjudication in a moment of historic importance.\n\nIn the early hours of Saturday, for instance, a majority on the high court temporarily blocked the administration from deporting a group of immigrants in Texas under the 1798 Alien Enemies Act. Justice Samuel Alito, who dissented along with his fellow conservative Clarence Thomas, slammed the decision as “unprecedented and legally questionable.” The court is expected to issue a more formal ruling on whether the White House can go ahead in the coming days.\n\nThe use of the Alien Enemies Act is controversial for several reasons. First, it’s one of the most notorious laws in US history and was the basis for the internment of Japanese Americans in World War II, which is now regarded as a dark chapter in US history. Second, the act is designed to be used in time of war to detain and deport civilians. Despite Trump’s claim that the US is subject to a migrant invasion, the US is not in a state of war.\n\nIn another case related to the act, US District Judge James Boasberg ruled Wednesday that the administration showed “willful disregard” for his mid-March order halting deportation flights amid a dispute over the legality of the removals. He was the first judge to find “probable cause exists” to hold administration officials in criminal contempt.\n\nThe key concerns about the use of the Alien Enemies Act come down to the lack of opportunities for detainees to challenge the action against them in court. This impression — that basic constitutional rights and legal procedures that underpin the republic are being infringed — is crystalized by the Abrego Garcia case and is why Trump opponents like Van Hollen regard it as so critical.\n\nIn a key twist in the drama last week, a federal appeals court knocked back the administration’s request to overrule a Maryland federal judge, Paula Xinis, in the Abrego Garcia case. Xinis is growing increasingly frustrated with the administration’s delaying tactics and defiance after she ordered it to follow the instructions of the Supreme Court and “facilitate” his return.\n\nIn a ruling Thursday, the US Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit denied the government’s emergency motion to stay Xinis’ order pending appeal. Writing for the appeals court, Judge Harvie Wilkinson said the administration’s assertion of “a right to stash away residents of this country in foreign prisons without the semblance of due process” should be “shocking not only to judges, but to the intuitive sense of liberty that Americans far removed from courthouses still hold dear.”\n\nWilkinson, an appointee of former President Ronald Reagan, warned of a situation in which two branches of government were “grinding irrevocably against one another in a conflict that promises to diminish both.”\n\n“If today the Executive claims the right to deport without due process and in disregard of court orders, what assurance will there be tomorrow that it will not deport American citizens and then disclaim responsibility to bring them home?” Wilkinson asked. “And what assurance shall there be that the Executive will not train its broad discretionary powers upon its political enemies?”\n\nThe ruling encapsulated this perilous moment in American history, and the question of whether the judiciary — one of the last effective checks on Trump’s power — will constrain or enable a president who sees few limits on his authority.', '‘A lawless president’', 'Published 12:00 AM EDT, Mon April 21, 2025', 'how-the-deportation-of-a-salvadoran-man-has-become-a-hinge-point-in-us-history-1745808372'),

Strain chimes in that Holland and Mexico are good options if there is no choice but to import. Some of the vases and other hardware in the shop still come from the states, but Smith and Strain are busy looking for alternatives.\n\n“It’s … Donald Trump,” Smith said. “I feel like he’s a bully in this situation. We’re supposed to be allies. We thought we were on a friendship level.”\n\nTariff threats. Talk of making Canada the 51st state. Derisive references to the prime minister as governor. “It’s very insulting,” Smith says, before showing off the maple leaf earrings she chose for CNN’s visit “because I love Canada.”\n\nThe Trump effect is easy to find. There are more Canadian flags flying. “Proud Canadian” placards in windows. And, importantly, a very different tone and tenor as voters here prepare to pick a new parliament and prime minister.\n\nSmith and Strain are just two examples.\n\nBoth are traditionally Green Party supporters. But both told CNN they are all but certain to vote Liberal Party next week because they know the Greens won’t win enough seats to pick the prime minister. The Liberals do have a shot, and Smith and Strain want the winning party to have as big a mandate as possible.\n\nCanadians don’t vote for prime minister. They cast ballots to elect a representative for their district, or riding, and the party that wins the most seats gets to form the government and pick the prime minister, usually the party leader.\n\n‘We just need a strong leader who won’t stand for bullying,” Smith said. “You put your vote where it counts more in this situation.”\n\nToby Gorman offers more proof Canadians are rethinking just about everything.\n\nGorman is an author and environmental journalist, and self-described independent who says he has supported candidates of all stripes over the years. But the climate crisis is his most important issue right now, and Gorman sees the Green Party as most aligned with his views. But he, too, said his plan, barring a last-second reversal, is to vote Liberal.\n\n“If it was any other election, without the US situation, without the crisis we have going on, I would probably go with the Greens,” Gorman said. Like Smith and Strain, he wants the winner to have a mandate. And he has been impressed with Prime Minister Mark Carney, who’s been on the job just since mid-March after replacing Justin Trudeau as Liberal leader.\n\nThe smaller parties tend to fare a little better in Canada than they do in the United States. There are no Green Party members of the US Congress, for example, but the Greens currently hold two of the 338 seats in the Canadian Parliament. The New Democrats hold 24 seats; the Bloc Quebecois 33. But Gorman is among those shifting toward one of the two major parties because he wants the winner to have more power.\n\n“A very focused leader,” is Gorman’s take on Carney. “A smart leader. He can handle the economy. I believe he can handle the US situation.”\n\nEvery Canadian to whom we spoke, on this Ontario visit and on a trip to British Columbia a few weeks ago, characterized this campaign as a crossroads moment.\n\nCanada’s government, they say, needs to increase its military spending and find new economic markets and partners. Canadians should double-check at the grocery store and buy Canadian over American whenever possible. And both alike should rid themselves of the idea that Canada’s neighbor to the south is a reliable friend with shared values.\n\n“We’re just sick of him,” Gorman said of Trump. “And it has only been three months into the term. It’s, he’s going to annex us. He wants to crush us economically. At first it was kind of like losing your best friend. You know, ‘What’s happened? What is happening?’ But now I think we are at the point where it’s like, we can move on.”\n\nFederal elections here are often defined by geographic or cultural rivalries. East versus West. The coasts versus the middle. Urban versus rural. English versus French. Liberal versus Conservative. But Trump has spawned a wave of Canadian nationalism, and he is the central issue in this race.\n\n“I put up a flag myself,” said Gorman. “I never thought I would put up a Canadian flag. But when it comes to crunch time, Canadians really gather up. … We have our unity issues, but right now Trump is definitely causing a bit more pride than we usually show.”\n\nPeter Hamilton is a lifelong conservative and hopes the Conservatives come out on top when the votes are counted next week. But he has seen the historic swing in the polls: a 25-point Conservative edge in January has evaporated, and the late polling shows a modest Liberal advantage.\n\n“The bottom line is the liberals and conservatives got to work together here,” Hamilton said. “They can’t be nitpicking and arguing amongst each other. We have to work together to make this country go – go ahead.”\n\nThat consensus is critical, Hamilton says, because the United States suddenly seems so distant and unreliable.\n\nWe interviewed Hamilton at Rock Maple Lodge, a 200-acre farm in a rural area about 60 miles from Toronto. The border and Buffalo are about 100 miles away, but Hamilton said the states suddenly don’t feel so close.\n\nSome 2,000 maple trees dot the property and there are 11 miles of tubing to carry maple syrup back to a building where it is boiled, filtered and bottled, some after additional aging in bourbon barrels from the United States. Hamilton also grows corn, wheat and soybeans and has a sawmill for a modest timber business.\n\nHamilton, always a proud Canadian, now feels that way more than ever. He greets a visitor in a Team Canada hockey jersey and our first stop is a farm building full of memorabilia from hockey legends: Wayne Gretzky, Guy Lafleur, Bobby Orr and many more.\n\nIn a window of another building: One of the “Proud Canadian” placards we saw over and over again during our Ontario visit, from reliably liberal downtown Toronto to the conservative rural strongholds dotted by dairy and vegetable farms and Hamilton’s Rock Maple Lodge.\n\nHamilton is 75 and has had the farm for 54 years, after also working in home construction. He has seen a lot. But nothing like this. Like most Canadians we met, he could not fathom why Trump decided to take the relationship from neighborly to nasty.\n\nBut he also isn’t one to dwell and believes the Canadian election is a key step for a country he says needs to reassert its independence and stress its manners.\n\n“There is no friend anymore,” Hamilton said of the United States. “The biggest thing in Canada is we have friends all over the world.

But first, a moment to outline the stakes:\n\n“Fair maps, abortion, voting rights,” is Lang’s list. “It’s not a seat we can afford to lose because if Republicans and conservatives gain control of the court, that’s Elon Musk and that’s a through line to the Trump agenda.”\n\nOn paper, the April 1 election pits Susan Crawford against Brad Schimel for a vacancy on the Wisconsin state Supreme Court. Liberal Justice Ann Walsh Bradley is retiring, and the election will determine the court’s ideological balance. Crawford currently serves as a Dane County Circuit Court judge and is a former prosecutor and legal counsel to a past Democratic governor. Schimel is a Waukesha County Circuit Court judge and was the state’s GOP attorney general from 2015 to 2019.\n\nThe court race is a reminder that Wisconsin isn’t just a 50-50 state in presidential races. Close contests for Supreme Court seats have been common in recent years, and liberals are fighting in this one to maintain the 4-3 edge in the court they won in 2023.\nPresident Donald Trump’s weekend endorsement of Schimel only elevates the national stakes of the contest.\n\nThey’re even bigger for Lang and organizations like Black Leaders Organizing for Communities, of which Lang is executive director. She preached a version of that “can’t afford to lose” argument five months ago, but Trump won Wisconsin on his way to a swing-state sweep and the White House. Now, with November’s bruises still tender, she faces another giant organizing and turnout challenge.\n\n“There’s always the finger-pointing after an election,” Lang said in an interview. “This would be the first true local test to see if there are lessons learned.”\n\nTrump increased his vote total and vote share in Milwaukee in November, including in the predominantly Black neighborhoods where BLOC operates. Lang’s way of doing things is among the points of post-election debate.\n\nPro-Trump groups were nowhere near as visible or active as BLOC when it came to door knocking and community meetings. Yet Trump increased his share of the Black vote and, with help from Musk and others, used digital tools to reach and activate voters.\n\nIn this Supreme Court election, Musk has funneled nearly $7 million to a conservative group in the state that is trying to mirror the 2024 strategy to mobilize voters for Trump. It includes digital targeting as well as traditional canvassing operations. A super PAC Musk has supported in the past is also spending heavily on television advertising. It is not required to disclose its donors.\n\nLang hears the criticism that old-fashioned door-knocking isn’t as effective or necessary anymore. But she dismisses it as uninformed.\n\n“We will definitely increase some of our digital stuff,” Lang said. But, “I will always take stock in listening to our team that is knocking all day every day and has more of a pulse on the community than any overpaid consultant that likely is not even from our state and hasn’t set foot in our community.”\n\nWe visited with Lang several times last year as part of our All Over the Map project tracking the 2024 campaign through the eyes and experiences of Americans who live in key states and are part of crucial voting blocs. Lang was well aware, especially in the final weeks, that Trump was running stronger in her community, especially among Black men.\n\n“People didn’t feel the Democrats were addressing the needs and the issues of the average voter,” Lang said. “People wanted to try something different.”\n\nNow, despite the enormous stakes in the Supreme Court race, Lang and other progressives here told us turnout remains a giant worry.\n\n“There’s so much voter fatigue,” Lang said. “People don’t want to talk about politics right now. They feel completely checked out.”\n\nThat voter fatigue is just one piece of a complicated challenge for Democrats. There are tensions between grassroots activists and consultants over what went wrong in 2024 and how to fix it, both on how to prioritize an issues list and how to then communicate it more effectively; over whether they can or should make Musk an election foil.\n\nThere is also anger at Democratic leaders for not showing more fight – and having more success – as President Trump moves at a frenetic pace.\n\n“We need to hold our ground,” is how Democratic consultant Josh Klemons put it. “Then Senate Democrats cave and absolutely people are frustrated. There’s no question about it. … It’s very hard to keep asking people to give their everything when they don’t see real progress.”\n\nKlemons is trying, with frequent TikTok posts about the stakes of the court election. He is the first to admit that – at first glance, anyway – he might not look the part.\n\n“I’m not a camera guy,” Klemons said in an interview at his Madison home. “I didn’t grow up wanting to be a digital influencer.”\n\nBut he posted a TikTok complaining about how Republicans drew Wisconsin legislative maps a couple of years ago. “And it blew up,” he said. “And I did another a few days later, and it blew up even harder.”\n\nNow, he posts one a day on average, some shot in his basement office, others on a woodsy trail near his home. “My whole message is that we are in this together,” he said. “No campaign is going to save us.”\n\nOn our latest Wisconsin visit, we stopped by a Milwaukee Democrats monthly meeting where the discussion was mostly about the urgency of the court race. But one member offered a resolution urging the group to invest in new organizing offices in Black and Latino sections of the city where Trump improved his vote share in 2024.\n\nKlemons has no issue with more visibility and brick-and-mortar party offices. But he says Democrats and progressives need to think and act on a much grander scale.\n\n“Republicans have built a massive media infrastructure that allows them to get out their message in a way Democrats cannot compete with,” he said. “It doesn’t matter if our messages are better or not because they are not getting heard.”\n\nKlemons sees a 2024 replay in the final weeks of the Crawford-Schimel race: Musk pouring millions into advertising and turnout efforts.\n\n“Wisconsin has a real chance on April 1 to show money cannot buy elections,” he said in the interview – echoing one of his TikTok themes. “The world’s richest man cannot pick and choose who should serve in our government at every level.”\n\nDemocrats are making Musk as much of an issue, if not even more of one, than Trump himself.\n\n“We live in Elon Musk’s world right now,” Klemons said. “I’m working very hard to make sure we don’t live in Elon Musk’s Wisconsin.”\n\nKate Duffy, like Klemons, calls her path to Instagram accidental. She founded a group called Motherhood for Good back in 2022 and now posts regularly on issues she sees as essential to busy mothers like herself.\n\n“I try to make content that can be digested between bath and bedtime,” Duffy said in an interview at her home in suburban Milwaukee. “A quick video that somebody can watch in two or three minutes is going to do really well.”\n\nOne Duffy staple is 60-second explainers of key issues and themes. She augments the posts with maps and graphics. But she is also now leaning into longer posts – for her, a key lesson of her 2024 experience trying to help Kamala Harris.\n\n“My biggest takeaway is to listen to my gut more,” Duffy said. “We can do a longer video. We can explain things more. We can add more nuance. People are craving that.”\n\nMessages from campaign consultants dissuaded her from doing more of that last year.\n\n“(I) kept hearing, well, ‘These are the messages. It needs to be quick and simple. And hit this.’ And looking back, I’m realizing that is probably what came off as inauthentic and didn’t really resonate with as many people.”\n\nAnother takeaway: Talk more and smarter about the economy and the cost of living.\n\n“There’s so many women who make all the household purchasing decisions and are in charge of the budget and that is certainly somewhere where we can do better,” Duffy said.\n\nDemocratic consultants, she said, urged a focus on abortion rights and women’s rights. “That’s foundational,” Duffy said. “I’m always going to believe in that. But we can’t discount somebody’s actual struggle they are feeling to put food on the table for their kids. That is a daily trauma they are dealing with. So I think we need to do a better job messaging towards the economy.”\n\nThe barbershop was a daily town hall long before the internet, long before new media and social media and big data.\n\nEric Jones stops by the Exodus Hair Studio in Milwaukee once a week for a trim and for crackling conversations about the Bucks and the Brewers, about the local economy and about everything under the sun when it comes to politics.\n\nJones was part of our All Over the Map Project last year and repeatedly told us – in part because of the chatter at Exodus – that Trump was running stronger among Black men than he had in 2016 and 2020.\n\nHe is, again, worried about Musk money late in a campaign.\n\n“Any political campaign is essentially an information war,” Jones said. “And any war needs a budget. The guy with the biggest budget tends to win.”\n\nAnd he is worried, again, about Black turnout.\n\n“I’ve asked a good amount of people,” Jones told us in an interview at Exodus. “It’s bad when you don’t know the candidates.”\n\nJones was a reliable barometer of his community throughout 2024. Now, in the early days of the new Trump term, he has two takeaways.\n\nJones hears some buyer’s remorse among Latino friends who shifted to Trump and now regret it because of the administration’s crackdown on the undocumented.\n\n“They are regretting it now – right now,” Jones said. “But his policies haven’t gotten to the Black community yet.” Many of Jones’ friends, for example, believe the federal government can be cut substantially and yawn when Trump critics complain about installing loyalists at the FBI and Department of Justice.\n\n“That doesn’t resonate with them,” Jones said. “Let him do something that affects their day-to-day.”\n\nSo far, Jones said he sees little to nothing that convinces him Democrats have learned their 2024 lessons. That worries him some in the context of the Supreme Court election.\n\n“But it’s kind of unfair,” Jones is quick to add. “Because it just happened to them. I don’t know if anybody can learn a lesson that quickly. … The midterms will be a better chance to see it.”\n\nThis story has been updated with additional information.', '', 'Updated 4:36 PM EDT, Tue March 25, 2025', 'for-wisconsin-liberals-upcoming-supreme-court-race-is-first-test-of-lessons-learned-1745808372'),

Obviously, people know that when I said that, it was said in jest, but it was also said that it will be ended,” Trump said, according to Time’s transcript.\n\nThis “in jest” claim is a lie.\n\nOn the campaign trail in 2023 and 2024, Trump said on dozens of occasions, in an entirely serious tone, manner and context, that he would end the war in Ukraine either within 24 hours of his return to the White House or even sooner than that. He said over and over again, including at both presidential debates of 2024, that he would have the war “settled” when he was president-elect, before his inauguration.\n\nA Friday search of the Roll Call Factba.se database that catalogues Trump’s public remarks turned up at least 53 examples of Trump making such comments.\n\nIt’s sometimes hard to determine the intent of a politician’s one-time ad-libs, but this was no jovial ad-lib. Rather, the promise of a rapid end to the war was a sober staple of Trump’s pre-written rally remarks. He framed the promise as a key component of his second-term agenda, and he justified it with claims about his “credibility” as a leader, his history as a “peacemaker,” and his knowledge of Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nTrump sometimes emphasized that he was speaking literally, scoffing at critics who said he couldn’t end the war that fast. “I’ll get that done within 24 hours. Everyone says, ‘Oh, no, you can’t.’ Absolutely I can. Absolutely I can,” he said at one July 2023 rally in Iowa. He said at a Pennsylvania rally later that month: “Before I even arrive at the Oval Office, shortly after we all together win the presidency, we will have the horrible war between Russia and Ukraine settled. It will be settled. The war is going to be settled. I’ll get them both – I know Zelensky, I know Putin, it’ll be done within 24 hours, you watch.

Groceries. Eggs. Over the last week, President Donald Trump has lied about the price of all of them — using this repeated deception to try to minimize widespread concerns that his tariffs will fuel inflation.\n\nHere is a fact check.\n\nTrump claimed last Thursday that gas prices “hit $1.98 yesterday in a couple of states.” That wasn’t true. No state had an average gas price below $2.70 per gallon on Wednesday, according to data from AAA, which reported a national average of about $3.17 per gallon. And the lowest individual Wednesday price found by the firm GasBuddy, which tracks tens of thousands of gas stations across the country, was $2.19 at a station in Texas.\n\nThe White House couldn’t substantiate Trump’s claim when CNN inquired, and it added a new false claim that gas prices in “the Middle America” are at “record lows.” Then Trump said the next day that three states had hit $1.98 per gallon on Thursday. There was no basis for that, either; the lowest AAA state average on Thursday was also $2.70 per gallon, and GasBuddy again found no stations selling for less than $2.19 per gallon.\n\nTrump claimed last Thursday and Friday that grocery prices “are down” and then claimed Tuesday that they have “come down.” False again. Average grocery prices in March were up about 0.49% from February, according to federal Consumer Price Index data, which was the biggest month-to-month jump since October 2022. Average grocery prices in March were also up about 2.41% from the previous March, the biggest year-over-year jump since August 2023.\n\nThese increases happened before Trump imposed 10% tariffs in early April on imports from most countries, which are certain to raise the prices of some grocery items.\n\nEgg prices have spiked over the past year amid a bird flu outbreak. Trump claimed Tuesday that “as you know, the cost of eggs has come down like 93, 94% since we took office.” That is wildly inaccurate.\n\nA decline of 93% or 94% from the national average consumer cost of a dozen large Grade A eggs in January, about $4.95, would mean that eggs are now costing consumers under 38 cents per dozen. Any grocery shopper can tell you that is nowhere close to true; in March, this national average price hit a record high of about $6.23 per dozen. It’s very possible the April average is lower — the data will be published in May — but clearly not nearly as low as Trump said.\n\nThe White House has previously pointed to wholesale egg prices as evidence of improvement, though those aren’t the prices consumers pay in stores. Wholesale prices have declined substantially since late February, but, again, not nearly as much as Trump claimed. As of Friday, the national wholesale price for a dozen large white eggs was $3.13, according to the US Department of Agriculture, down from $6.55 as of the Friday after Trump took office on January 20. That’s a decline of about 52%, not 93% or 94%.\n\nThe White House couldn’t substantiate Trump’s “93, 94%” claim, either. Instead, spokesperson Anna Kelly emailed CNN a comment on Wednesday that asserted egg prices are “down significantly” under Trump because of his efforts to fight bird flu.', 'Gas', 'Published 1:41 PM EDT, Wed April 23, 2025', 'fact-check-trump-lies-about-the-price-of-eggs-groceries-and-gas-1745808373'),

He’s drawn attention for a number of controversial moves during his tenure, including referring to the nation’s largest office of federal prosecutors as “President Trumps’ [sic] lawyers,” and demoting senior attorneys who worked on January 6, 2021, Capitol riot cases.\n\nAfter Trump formally nominated him for the permanent job in March, Martin submitted mandatory paperwork to the Senate, including what is supposed to be a detailed account of all his past media appearances.\n\nBut a CNN KFile analysis of Martin’s initial 27-page disclosure form reveals that it does not come close to capturing the extent of his media appearances, and it lacks any reference to at least 240 podcast, radio and TV interviews he’s done in the past two years alone .\n\nMartin has subsequently updated his disclosures twice this month, including filing a 12-page supplemental form dated April 15 that listed dozens more media appearances. Still, overall, his disclosures fail to capture the vast majority of his media appearances over the years.\n\nCNN tallied 198 appearances Martin failed to disclose between 2023 and 2024, including ones in which he suggested that, as US attorney for DC, he would prosecute family members of former President Joe Biden and criminally charge people involved in federal investigations into Trump.\n\nMartin noted in his initial disclosure form in March that there “may be other materials I have been unable to identify, find or remember.” Just as he did in his April 7 disclosure update, Martin wrote in Tuesday’s submission, “I regret the errors and apologize for any inconvenience.”\n\nWhile it’s not unusual for nominees from either party to omit some media appearances and later amend their disclosure forms, Martin’s omissions in some cases appear to be glaring. He initially listed zero media appearances in 2023, for instance, but according to a CNN tally, he made at least 124 separate appearances across podcasts, radio shows and television that year.\n\nMartin’s updated form includes 19 appearances from 2023, leaving at least 105 appearances still unaccounted for.\n\nEven the updates Martin submitted on Tuesday were incomplete. Most of the web links he provided do not work. And on multiple occasions, Martin failed to capture all of his appearances on a given day. For example, he added one interview with Sputnik on December 13, 2023, but failed to include three other podcast appearances CNN found from that day.\n\nWhile Martin disclosed his podcast, “The Pro America Report with Ed Martin,” in his paperwork, the episodes are unavailable to listen to across most major podcasting platforms.\n\nAt some point, within the five days before Martin submitted his paperwork to the Senate Judiciary Committee in late March, all episodes of his podcast on Apple Podcasts and Spotify were unavailable, according to a source involved in the committee review process.\n\nCNN, however, saved those podcast episodes earlier this year.\n\nMartin amended some of his disclosure paperwork in the early April letter sent to the committee and pushed back on committee Democrats who publicly accused him of removing “nearly 1,000 hours” of podcasts from online platforms such as Spotify and Apple Podcasts.\n\n“I want to make clear that I have never deleted or removed my podcasts,” Martin wrote in a letter to the panel reviewed by CNN. “After review, it appears those platforms are aggregating my podcasts, possibly for UX or storage purposes.”\n\nMartin pointed to segments of his podcast on SoundCloud, which he did not include in his paperwork but are available to listen to, and he claimed that “online platforms appear to be reconfiguring podcast titles and segments unbeknownst to me.”\n\nA Spotify spokesperson told CNN it did not remove the show from its platform. CNN reached out to Apple for comment but did not receive a response.\n\nThe undisclosed appearances mostly include Martin’s comments on far-right outlets as well as at least 27 appearances on Russian-state podcasts in 2023 and 2024.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Washington Post reported that Martin appeared on Russian state media more than 150 times between 2016 and 2024. A Martin spokesperson told the Post, “Mr. Martin has disclosed all of the [Washington Post] identified links in a supplemental letter to the Senate.”\n\n“This is routine activity in preparation for confirmation,” said the spokesperson and referred questions to the White House.\n\nIn response to a detailed list of questions, Martin’s office referred CNN to the White House, which did not respond.\n\nOne former Democratic Senate Judiciary Committee staffer who worked on confirming Democratic and Republican nominees during the Clinton and Bush administrations said a scenario where an individual did not disclose multiple speeches or appearances would be a “huge concern” and “super problematic.”\n\n“There would be criticism of the Justice Department for failing to properly vet the nominee and make sure that it was disclosed,” said the former staffer, who didn’t want to be identified for fear of retaliation by Martin. “But the predominant consequence in a normal political environment would be that the person might not be confirmed because they hid information or failed to disclose relevant information.”\n\nThe clock is ticking on Martin’s nomination, which the Senate Judiciary Committee, chaired by Iowa Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley, has not moved forward. Martin’s status as acting US attorney expires on May 20, according to federal law. With the Senate scheduled to be out of town for the next two weeks, the timeline could get tight on bringing his nomination to a floor vote.\n\nCongressional Democrats have sought probes into Martin’s prosecutorial conduct. Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff earlier this month placed a hold on Martin’s nomination because of Martin’s rhetoric and conduct, which delays Republicans from moving forward and complicates the process. And Democrats have even taken the rare step of requesting a confirmation hearing.\n\nWhile Martin is known for attacking Democrats, he has also gone after Republican lawmakers, and some are starting to raise concerns.\n\nTexas Republican Sen. John Cornyn, whom Martin once derided as “soft” for supporting a bipartisan gun safety bill, told CNN last week that Martin was “controversial” and said he is pushing for the panel to hold a hearing.\n\n“I always think hearings are helpful,” said Cornyn, who added the idea of holding a hearing on Martin is being discussed among Senate Judiciary Republicans.\n\nBut in a statement to CNN, Grassley spokeswoman Clare Slattery indicated that the senator does not intend to hold hearings on Martin’s nomination.\n\n“The Senate Judiciary Committee hasn’t held a hearing for a US Attorney nominee in more than 40 years, and not once in the time Grassley has chaired or been ranking on the committee. Chairman Grassley intends to maintain this precedent,” the statement said. “The committee expects nominees to fully disclose all required materials as part of the standard nominations process, and Martin continues to make disclosures as part of that process.”\n\nIn other past comments, Martin referred to Utah Sen. John Curtis as a “supposed Republican” and “traitor” for voting to extend the deadline for ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment. He said Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski “pretends to represent conservatives” and deserved to be primaried, and he praised the potential censure of Maine Republican Sen. Susan Collins because she voted to convict Trump in his second impeachment trial. Martin also said Kentucky Sen. Mitch McConnell was part of a “swamp fix” who became rich from their work in government.\n\nThis month, five former prosecutors who worked on January 6, 2021, cases sent a letter urging the DC bar’s legal disciplinary office to investigate Martin for his conduct, citing Martin’s public statements in which he suggested investigating “perceived political enemies of himself and the President.”\n\nMartin has a history of staking out hardline, socially conservative positions, including publicly advocating for a national abortion ban without exceptions for rape or incest. He’s even raised the idea of imposing criminal penalties on women and doctors involved in abortions, as CNN’s KFile has previously reported.\n\nPrior to heading one of the nation’s most powerful US attorney’s offices, Martin had no prosecutorial experience. He has served as a defense attorney for a handful of January 6 rioters.\n\nDuring his four months as acting US attorney for Washington, DC, Martin has displayed his loyalty to Trump : He ordered a series of firings, demotions and reassignments of prosecutors working January 6 cases. He launched his own probes into Capitol riot prosecutions and the legality of Biden’s twilight pardons, and he publicly promised Elon Musk that his office would investigate people threatening Musk and his government workers and “chase them to the end of the Earth to hold them accountable.”\n\nThe New York Times reported earlier this month that Martin’s office is pursuing an inquiry into Biden’s pardons of his family members.\n\nMartin previously worked as the president of Phyllis Schlafly Eagles – a socially conservative advocacy group named for the late anti-feminist activist. He was a leader in the “Stop the Steal” movement that falsely claimed Trump won the 2020 presidential election.\n\nIn comments from a December 2024 radio interview that Martin failed to disclose, Martin criticized Biden for pardoning his son Hunter Biden.\n\n“If I was the US attorney in Washington, DC, on January 21, I would impanel a grand jury. And I would call Hunter Biden before the grand jury, who has to go without a lawyer, and he has to answer questions because now he has immunity from prosecution. So the protection under the Constitution of not incriminating yourself goes away if you’re immune,” said Martin on “The Stevie Jay Morning Show.”\n\n“If he doesn’t answer the questions or he lies, he goes to jail because that’s a new crime. It’s not covered by Biden as the pardon,” said Martin, adding that he would like to look at other Biden family members who received pardons, naming the former president’s brother James.\n\nA week after the podcast episode aired, Martin was tapped to be the next chief of staff at the Office of Management and Budget. But by January 20, Trump appointed him as the interim US attorney for Washington, DC.\n\nAnd in previously unreported comments Martin made on his podcast in August 2023, Martin said that the people involved in federal investigations into Trump should face criminal investigations and be “charged under RICO,” which refers to the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act, most famously used to prosecute organized crime in the 1970s and 1980s.\n\nMartin has also repeated January 6 conspiracy theories that “Antifa” was possibly behind the violence and about the pipe bombs found near the Republican National Committee and Democratic National Committee headquarters that day, insisting that “something stinks. Something stinks to high heaven.”\n\nMartin said in a March 2024 episode of his podcast that “if the FBI really can’t find out what happened,” it’s because “either the FBI is corrupt, which I’m not willing to say yet, or someone bigger than the FBI has made it.”\n\nHe then baselessly speculated whether the military was involved in planting the pipe bombs.\n\n“I remember someone told me afterwards that the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the head of the military, has a lot of special ops things going on. I don’t know if that’s true. I’m just saying something bigger than the FBI is needed to hide this. Because the FBI has the tools to find something like this,” Martin said.\n\nCNN’s Kate Carroll and Winter Hawk contributed to this story.', 'Martin’s podcast suddenly unavailable', 'Published 7:00 AM EDT, Thu April 17, 2025', 'trumps-pick-to-be-dcs-top-prosecutor-failed-to-report-nearly-200-appearances-on-farright-media-outlets-to-senate-1745808373');

They haven’t disappeared so much from globalization or from shipping them overseas,” Vance said in a January 2017 interview with Education Week. “They’ve largely disappeared because of automation and because of new technological change.”\n\nOther comments and social media activity from Vance during that time directly took aim at Trump’s trade rhetoric. Shortly after Trump met with manufacturing CEOs in February 2017 and publicly railed against America’s trade deficits, Vance pushed back.\n\n“Can’t be repeated enough: if you’re worried about America’s economic interest, focus more on automation/education than trade protectionism,” Vance wrote.\n\nIn December 2016, as then-President-elect Trump visited a Carrier plant in Indiana to tout a deal he claimed would keep manufacturing jobs from moving to Mexico, Vance liked a tweet from Republican Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse that offered a different explanation for job loss.\n\n“Automation—even more than trade—will continue to shrink the number of manufacturing jobs,” Sasse wrote. “This trend is irreversible.”\n\nThe like, which CNN saved before X made likes private last year, underscored Vance’s alignment at the time with Republicans who doubted the effectiveness of Trump’s proposals to restore blue-collar jobs through trade pressure alone.\n\nEven when Vance acknowledged that globalization had caused deep harm in some communities, citing research that linked increased exposure to Chinese imports with strain on local labor markets, he argued that those downsides did not justify a sweeping reversal of US trade policy.\n\n“Now does that mean that we should be hyper-protectionists in our approach to trade? I would argue no,” Vance said at an April 2017 event. “But should we be cognizant of the fact that when you have some of those communities that are really exposed to trade, it can very often harm them or at least cause some pretty negative consequences, even as it might cause some positive ones. I think we have to.”\n\n“I do think that trade hasn’t necessarily been in the best interests of a lot of these communities. Now, the question of whether you can go backwards in time, I think the answer is no,” he told a gathering at the University of Chicago in February 2017.\n\nThe long-term solution, Vance argued in December 2016, was to retrain workers.\n\n“The fundamental issue with American jobs and manufacturing right now is not that all of our jobs have gone to Mexico and China, it’s that they’ve been auto–automated. It’s that mechanization has sort of reduced the manufacturing work base,” he said. “There is a solution to that problem. It’s to train people for the next level of jobs, to train people for the 21st century workforce.”\n\nVance also expressed skepticism about Trump’s promises to revive traditional industries through trade policy, specifically questioning whether legacy jobs like coal and steel could ever return.\n\n“I don’t think that there’s a simple, ‘Let’s bring the coal or steel jobs back,’” Vance said in early 2017. “But I also think that if folks are employed in next generation jobs with dignified work and good wages, that they’re not gonna be angry that Trump didn’t bring back the steel jobs.”\n\nWhile recognizing the downsides of globalization, Vance also argued it was too late to reverse course while agreeing at the time that fighting over trade was “yesterday’s war.”\n\n“Maybe you could [turn the clock back] a little bit on trade if we were in the ’80s, but we’ve already lost that battle in some ways,” Vance told CNN in February 2017. “The jobs are already gone.”\n\nMore recently, Vance has credited Trump’s first term in the White House with broadly shifting his view on his agenda. And Vance’s public statements on globalization were beginning to shift by 2019, just before he has said he fully embraced Trump, voting for him in 2020 and then running the next year for Senate as a Trump-allied Republican. In October 2019, Vance called the view that automation had taken jobs a “bad argument.”\n\n“I’m not an economist, but I can spot a bad argument. And the argument–reproduced ad nauseum in the business press–that manufacturing jobs not keeping pace with output = automation is the main culprit is really bad,” he wrote.\n\nBut even in the final half of Trump’s first term, when Vance was more sympathetic to the Trump administration’s arguments on trade, he was not optimistic on the odds of success of protectionist policies.\n\n“FWIW, my guess is the policy may very well fail, especially if Biden is elected president and China’s intransigence is rewarded. I’ve seen some claim that they’re explicitly betting on that fact,” he wrote.', '', 'Updated 9:57 PM EDT, Fri April 4, 2025', 'the-policy-may-very-well-fail-jd-vance-doubted-trumps-firstterm-trade-policies-previously-bashed-tariffs-1745808373'),

Wolf', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/200505140935-what-matters-logo-special-article-page-large-169.png?q=h_50', 'The Internal Revenue Service building in Washington, DC, on February 20, 2025.', 'CNN’s report that the IRS is making plans to revoke Harvard University’s tax-exempt status the day after President Donald Trump suggested it represents an unprecedented use of presidential power over the tax code.\n\nWhile there are examples of colleges losing or failing to achieve tax-exempt status, this has never come on the heels of a president’s express wish. The IRS is supposed to be immune from politics.\n\nUS law specifically prohibits presidents from directing the IRS to investigate anyone in a section entitled: “Prohibition on executive branch influence over taxpayer audits and other investigations.”\n\nWhile the IRS falls under the Treasury Department, it’s important that it be as protected from politics as possible. That’s why the IRS has only two politically appointed officials, according to Mark Mazur, who was assistant secretary of treasury for tax policy at the outset of the Biden administration\n\nThe US has higher voluntary tax payment rates than other countries, Mazur told me, “because people feel that their interactions with the tax system are fair and based on law.”\n\nIf the IRS is suddenly used for political purposes, that trust could be destroyed. During the Obama administration, for instance, the IRS became embroiled in a bona fide scandal when a Treasury Department investigation found the IRS delayed conferring tax-exempt status on conservative groups.\n\nIf the IRS did find that its tax-exempt status should be revoked, Harvard would need to be warned and given an opportunity to contest the finding. It would also have the opportunity to challenge the IRS in court.\n\nThere is already a lot of chaos at the IRS under the new Trump administration. Multiple acting commissioners have resigned, apparently the result a standoff over whether tax data could be used by immigration officials.\n\nBack in 1983, the Supreme Court agreed that Bob Jones University should not be tax-exempt because, at the time, it banned interracial relationships among its students.\n\nThe university didn’t drop its interracial marriage policy until 2000 — in an announcement on CNN’s Larry King Live, coincidentally — although it did not regain its tax-exempt status until 2017.\n\nThe US has now come full circle to the point that one of the main gripes Trump has with Harvard is its diversity programs.\n\nIf there’s one American university that should be able to stand up to the Trump administration, it’s Harvard.\n\nThe nation’s most famous institution of higher learning has resources. Its endowment exceeds $50 billion.\n\nIt also has allies. A shocking number of Republican and Democratic lawmakers are alumni — nearly 10% of representatives and nearly 20% of senators, according to one estimate.\n\nBut for all of its wealth and cachet, the institution relies on federal funding and its tax-exempt status like every other major research university.\n\nAfter Harvard rejected the Trump administration’s demand for access to and review of Harvard’s employment, hiring and admissions data, as well as the discontinuation of all diversity programs, Trump said on social media that the university’s tax-exempt status should be rescinded.\n\nThe long-term question will be what would happen to Harvard without federal dollars and exemption from billions of dollars it might owe in taxes if it lost that status — not only to the federal government, but perhaps also to the state of Massachusetts.\n\nHarvard, along with most major public and private US colleges, is exempt from paying taxes because of its status as a nonprofit organization.\n\nLike churches and charities, universities fall under section 501(c)3 of US tax code. The idea, which is written into the law, is that their benefit to society — in this case, education and research — outweighs the need for the tax base they would provide.\n\nNot all institutes of higher learning go this route, as Trump is intimately aware. His now-defunct Trump University was a for-profit organization that was sued for fraud by former presidents. Trump settled the lawsuits.\n\nTax-exempt universities, on the other hand, must refrain from endorsing candidates or influencing legislation, among other things. They must publicly provide annual reports on their activities and finances.\n\nThe IRS and the US have challenged the tax-exempt status of universities and other organizations, as occurred with South Carolina’s fundamentalist Bob Jones University.\n\nThe IRS challenged Bob Jones’ status in 1970, but the Supreme Court didn’t rule until 1983 that in order to be tax-exempt an organization must, “demonstrably serve and be in harmony with the public interest, and the institution’s purpose must not be so at odds with the common community conscience as to undermine any public benefit that might otherwise be conferred.”\n\nFor many years the IRS withheld tax-exempt status granted to religious organizations from the Church of Scientology, but reversed course in 1997 after a long and unconventional campaign by Scientologists.\n\nInterestingly, the tax law Trump signed during his first term levied a new tax on the wealthiest universities, including Harvard. The 1.4% excise tax on universities with more than $500,000 per student in their endowments applied to 58 universities in 2022, according to the Tax Policy Center, and raised $244 million. That tax still exists today.\n\nLawmakers are currently revisiting that law, and it could provide another opportunity to take a hard look at the taxes paid — or not — by universities.', 'Presidents aren’t supposed to direct IRS investigations', 'Published 5:59 PM EDT, Wed April 16, 2025', 'can-the-president-revoke-a-universitys-taxexempt-status-1745808373'),

Millions of their own voters may pay a price', 'https://edition.cnn.com/2025/04/20/politics/medicaid-expansion-congress-gop-budget/index.html', 'Ronald Brownstein', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/170705154518-fault-lines-logo-cut-large-169.png?q=h_50', 'People gather at the Statehouse Annex for a rally to protect Medicaid, Trenton, New Jersey, on March 6, 2025.', 'As the pressure grows on congressional Republicans to identify cuts in Medicaid, they are crashing into a familiar problem: The changes that could save the most money would impose heavy costs on many of their own voters.\n\nSeveral key House Republicans have signaled in recent days that they may try to cut Medicaid spending by rolling back the expansion in eligibility for the working poor included in the Affordable Care Act approved under President Barack Obama.\n\nThat option may be attractive to Republicans partly because the states that have most aggressively used that authority to expand eligibility mostly lean Democratic. Most House districts where more people than the national average receive health coverage through the Medicaid expansion are also held by Democrats, according to an exclusive new CNN analysis of data from KFF, a non-partisan health care think tank.\n\nBut GOP constituencies would hardly be immune if Congress rescinds the expansion. Nearly three dozen House Republicans also represent districts where the number of people receiving coverage through that Medicaid expansion exceeds the national district average of about 61,600, the analysis found. And nearly two dozen GOP senators likewise represent states with a substantial population of enrollees covered through the ACA’s Medicaid expansion.\n\n“It’s really a similar pattern that we’ve seen with the Affordable Care Act generally – that it’s become so embedded in the health care system and the lives of people across the country that it becomes very hard to take it away,” said Larry Levitt, executive vice president for health policy at KFF.\n\nAnswers on whether the expansion is too entrenched for congressional Republicans to uproot could begin arriving as soon as May 7, when the House Energy and Commerce Committee, which holds jurisdiction over Medicaid, is expected to start marking up the GOP’s massive budget “reconciliation” plan.\n\nFor all the controversy around both President Donald Trump’s assaults on civil liberties and his tariff moves, it’s likely that the most politically consequential decision congressional Republicans face this year is how to balance spending and tax cuts in the budget package they are formulating.\n\nWith Trump ruling out cuts in Social Security or Medicare benefits, Medicaid represents by far the largest pot of money available for the reductions that conservative budget hawks are demanding. The House budget resolution has instructed the Energy and Commerce Committee to find $880 billion in savings over the next decade; the Congressional Budget Office recently calculated that even if the committee completely zeroed out the other programs in its purview, it still could not reach that number without cutting Medicaid.\n\nRepublicans have long viewed Medicaid, which now provides health coverage for about 83 million lower-income Americans, as a more vulnerable target than Medicare, which serves seniors; GOP attempts to cut Medicaid and convert it into a block grant were central to the 1990s budget showdowns between President Bill Clinton and then-House Speaker Newt Gingrich. The bill House Republicans passed in 2017 to repeal the Affordable Care Act included major cutbacks in Medicaid, including a variation on the Gingrich-era block grant proposal.\n\nBut both the Medicaid population and the GOP electoral coalition have evolved in ways that complicate the party’s choices. The ACA expanded eligibility for Medicaid to far more working poor people. Previously, single childless adults were not eligible for the program at any income level; the ACA allowed states to cover those making up to 138% of the federal poverty level ($15,650 for an individual and about $21,000 for a married couple in 2025). The ACA also allowed states to raise the eligibility level for parents of young children to 138% of the poverty level; many states, particularly in the South, had cut off eligibility for parents at far lower levels before.\n\nTo encourage states to broaden coverage, the ACA committed Washington to funding 90% of the cost of the expansion population, much more than it pays states for other people covered through Medicaid (generally one-half to three-quarters, depending on the state). All but 10 states have now expanded Medicaid eligibility under the ACA, covering more than 20 million people in all.\n\nEven as the ACA expanded Medicaid eligibility up the income ladder to more working poor families, Republicans extended their electoral reach down the income and educational ladder through the political realignment accelerated under Trump. The result, as I wrote recently with CNN senior producer Edward Wu, is that 64 House Republicans now represent districts in which the share of Medicaid recipients exceeds the average for all districts. Far more Republicans than Democrats also represent districts with greater than average prevalence of major health problems including diabetes, obesity and high blood pressure – a reflection of the GOP’s growing consolidation of lower-education, lower-income, often rural House districts.\n\nThese shifts clearly have made congressional Republicans more uneasy about cutting Medicaid than in the 1990s, or even in 2017. But the Medicaid expansion population has remained a tempting target for them.\n\nFor one thing, the expansion is tied to the ACA, or Obamacare, which many Republicans, from Trump on down, still disparage. The expansion population, which includes people above the poverty line, is also more susceptible to the traditional argument Republicans have wielded against social welfare programs: that they reward the “undeserving poor” who should be paying their own way.\n\nIn recent weeks, multiple House Republicans have subtly, but tellingly, distinguished between Medicaid’s traditional enrollees – very low-income parents, people with disabilities, impoverished seniors – and those added under the ACA expansion. House Speaker Mike Johnson has repeatedly called for revoking Medicaid eligibility for “able-bodied workers, for example, young men … who should never be on the program at all.”\n\nEven a dozen House Republicans from swing districts who wrote Johnson last week expressing caution about Medicaid reductions made a similar distinction: while they would oppose cuts hurting “vulnerable populations,” they also said they want to “fix flaws in the program that divert resources away from children, seniors, individuals with disabilities, and pregnant women — those who the program was intended to help.” (Emphasis added.)\n\nThe most specific proposal for reversing the Medicaid expansion has come from Paragon Health Institute, a conservative health care think tank. Paragon has proposed to phase out the enhanced federal assistance for the expansion population over a decade, reducing it to the same reimbursement Washington offers for other recipients. “We’re 15 years post the ACA and I think the question for policy makers is: under what rationale should we paying more for childless adults than kids, pregnant women and people with disabilities on the program?” Brian Blase, the institute’s president and a health policy adviser to Trump during his first term, said in a recent interview.\n\nParagon projects that about 3 million people would lose health care coverage from the shift. That’s largely because it anticipates that most of those removed from Medicaid would qualify for federal subsidies to buy private health insurance through the ACA marketplaces.\n\nBut the Urban Institute, a center-left think tank, has projected that nearly 11 million people would lose health coverage if Congress revokes the enhanced Medicaid funding for the working poor. If states tried to maintain the current eligibility levels with their own funds, the Urban Institute found, it would require them to increase their Medicaid spending by about 25% annually, a virtual impossibility.\n\nMeanwhile, it would become much harder for people kicked off Medicaid to obtain coverage instead through the Obamacare exchanges if Republicans allow the enhanced ACA subsidies approved under President Joe Biden to expire this year, as they have signaled is likely. “If people in the expansion population lose coverage, they may be eligible on paper for the marketplace but many of them would not be able to afford it,” especially if the enhanced subsidies expire, said Allison Orris, director of Medicaid policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal group.\n\nThe new analysis of the KFF data by Wu, the senior CNN producer, suggests Republicans are right in their instinct that ending the expansion would rattle more windows in Democratic than GOP-leaning areas.\n\nNinety-eight Democrats represent districts where more people than the average are covered through the expansion, the analysis found. So many congressional Democrats represent big expansion populations , largely because the states that have added the most people through the expansion tend to be places where Democrats are highly competitive, including blue states California, New York, Illinois, Oregon and Virginia, as well as purple battlegrounds like Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Arizona, which are all in the top 10. Democrats, in fact, hold 46 more House seats than Republicans in the states that have expanded Medicaid eligibility, Wu calculated.\n\nConversely, Republicans in Congress are less exposed, largely because the 10 states that have refused to expand Medicaid – headlined by Texas, Florida and Georgia – all lean red, with the exception of Wisconsin (where the GOP-controlled legislature has long blocked expansion). Nearly 40% of House Republicans represent just those 10 states.\n\nEven so, the number of House Republicans from expansion states with large numbers of residents – and health care providers – who have come to rely on the new coverage still far exceeds the number of defections that would sink any budget plan. Thirty-two House Republicans also hold seats with an above-average number of expansion beneficiaries; 14 of them represent districts with 80,000 or more Medicaid expansion enrollees. And while the total number of expansion enrollees is greatest in Democratic-held districts (about 12.6 million), the 6.8 million in GOP seats still constitute a very large number of potential voters. Likewise, 22 Republican senators have been elected from the 29 states that have covered at least 100,000 people under the expansion, according to the KFF data.\n\nAnother factor could make Republicans hesitate about unwinding the expansion: its importance to health care systems in reliably red rural areas. In an interview, North Carolina Medicaid Director Jay Ludlam , for instance, pointed out that rural residents make up twice as big a share of the state’s Medicaid expansion population as they do of the overall population. Experts say that dynamic, which is evident in other states too, is primarily because workers in rural places are less likely to receive health insurance from their employers.\n\nThrough the expansion, Ludlam said, “We have seen individuals get medicines for heart disease, diabetes, for treatment of seizures – chronic diseases that would go otherwise untreated.” If people lose that coverage, he continued, “initially what you would start to see is an uptick in emergency room visits, which is an incredibly expensive way to provide health care,” with “eventually some of those chronic diseases beginning to have a really adverse impact on the health of many people.”\n\nThe best example of how all these pressures converge may be Speaker Johnson’s own state of Louisiana. As a lower-income, heavily rural state, Louisiana has been among the greatest beneficiaries of the Medicaid expansion. The state expanded eligibility under Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards in 2016 and his Republican successor, Gov. Jeff Landry, has not sought to repeal it.\n\nAccording to Kaiser, Louisiana has signed up nearly 800,000 people for the expansion, more than all but four other (and much larger) states. Johnson and fellow Louisiana GOP Reps. Julia Letlow, Clay Higgins and Steve Scalise each have more than 100,000 district residents receiving Medicaid through the expansion, which places all of them among the top eight of all House Republicans.\n\nJan Moller, executive director of Invest in Louisiana, an advocacy group for low-income families, says the Medicaid expansion has also provided a financial lifeline for the state’s health care providers.\n\nWhile rural hospitals are struggling in many states, he notes, none have closed in Louisiana since the expansion. “If you drive around Louisiana,” he added, “you will see a lot of clinics … where they didn’t exist 10 to 15 years ago.” Revoking expansion funding, Moller said, “would be devastating for Louisiana’s budget, and it would seriously threaten health care access for the 1 in 3 Lousianians who depend on Medicaid.”\n\nEven people with private insurance or Medicare would be hurt, Moller added, if reduced Medicaid revenue forces hospitals and other providers to close, particularly in rural areas with fewer alternatives. That could be a common problem in many states, Orris said. “Pulling as much money out of the health care system as they are talking about … will hurt everyone in a community,” she said.\n\nIf congressional Republicans can’t find the votes to directly reverse the expansion, they have signaled they may seek to truncate it by imposing a work requirement on Medicaid recipients. (Missouri GOP Sen. Josh Hawley, for instance, has said he will not support cuts in benefits, but would back a work requirement.) Surveys have found about two-thirds of people on Medicaid already work full- or part-time, and almost all the rest would likely be exempt from any mandate because of factors such as a disability or caring for a family member.\n\nBut when Arkansas and New Hampshire experimented with work requirements in Trump’s first term, large numbers of people were still thrown off the program for failing to meet the paperwork requirements to document their work. The same could happen with a federal mandate. It would be a bitter irony if a work requirement becomes a vehicle to erase the Medicaid expansion’s historic gains in extending health coverage to the working poor – in red places as well as blue.', 'Medicaid expansion is a tempting target for GOP budget cuts', 'Published 6:00 AM EDT, Sun April 20, 2025', 'republicans-are-targeting-a-pillar-of-obamacare-millions-of-their-own-voters-may-pay-a-price-1745808373'),

The layoffs, which will affect organizers, national representatives, support staff and others, could take place as early as June.\n\nBut the union, which represents more than 800,000 federal staffers, vowed to continue fighting.\n\n“The President’s elimination of elective membership dues and the resulting layoffs are a setback, but they are not the end of AFGE - not by a longshot,” the union said in a statement. “We will not be deterred, silenced, or intimidated into submission.”\n\nThe downsizing was first reported by the Associated Press.\n\nAFGE, along with other federal employee unions, have been hobbled by an executive order Trump signed in March aimed at stripping collective bargaining rights from a sizable share of government employees across more than a dozen agencies. AFGE alone represents about 660,000 workers in the affected departments, according to its lawsuit challenging the order.\n\nThe president said the action would strengthen national security, but a White House fact sheet also said the move was aimed at stopping federal unions who have “declared war on President Trump’s agenda.” It specifically cited “the largest Federal union,” which is “widely filing grievances to block Trump policies.”\n\nA federal judge paused Trump’s executive order late Friday afternoon in a lawsuit brought by the National Treasury Employees Union, the second largest federal workers’ union.

Along the way, it’s fired more than 100,000 government employees, including highly trained scientists and experts in a host of fields such as public health, foreign aid and diplomacy and disaster management.\n\nMusk, the world’s richest man, has served as the face of DOGE, trumpeting its findings – often riddled with inaccuracies or mischaracterizations. In Trump’s first 100 days, he frequently looked to be the second most powerful person in the government – appearing alongside Trump for joint interviews and being depicted on a February Time Magazine cover behind Trump’s Oval Office desk.\n\nBut amid a political backlash, Musk’s clashes with Trump’s Cabinet, and troubles at his electric car company, Musk said on a Tesla earnings call this week that his DOGE work is “mostly done.” While Musk can officially work as a “special government employee” for 130 days, he said that he would pull back starting next month, though he’ll continue to work a day or two each week at DOGE.\n\nEven if Musk fades away, dozens of his lieutenants are now embedded in top positions across federal agencies, a structure that could help the DOGE-budget cutters outlive Musk’s tenure in the government.\n\nRegardless of what comes next, the initial 100 days of DOGE have been unprecedented, with an impact that will reverberate for years to come.\n\n“There’s just never been anything like DOGE in American history,” said Donald Kettl, a former dean at the University of Maryland School of Public Policy and author of multiple books on the federal government.\n\n“The legacy, if Musk were to leave in the next hour, will be something that will last for a very long time,” Kettl added. “Because it took a very long time – decades and decades – to assemble the federal government as it was. And in less than 100 days, he’s taken it down to the foundations in lots of places.”\n\nWhile it’s too soon to measure the full political ramifications of DOGE, there are signs of a backlash — from anger at town halls to early Democratic electoral wins.\n\nDemocrats, out of power across all branches of the federal government after the GOP’s wins in November, have made Musk and DOGE an early focal point in their bid to win back control of the House and Senate next year.\n\nA state Supreme Court race in the perennial battleground of Wisconsin last month offered an early glimpse at how effective that strategy could be. Through personal contributions and spending by groups Musk has funded in the past, the tech billionaire pumped more than $20 million into the race. But the liberal candidate trounced the Musk-backed conservative, setting the stage for what could be 19 months of advertising focused on Musk.\n\nOpponents of the DOGE cuts have packed into town halls across the country — including the few public events held by Republicans, who have faced pointed questions about whether the spending cuts will undercut key services, and those hosted by Democrats, who face pressure to do more to stand up to Trump’s administration.\n\nThe scenes are reminiscent of 2009, when then-President Barack Obama’s push to remake America’s health insurance system fueled a conservative opposition that became the “tea party” and swept the GOP into power on Capitol Hill in the 2010 midterm elections.\n\nThey also call back to Trump’s first term, when his bid to rescind Obamacare was met with fierce opposition at Republican lawmakers’ town halls across the country — an early sign of what would become a wave that catapulted Democrats into power in the 2018 midterms.\n\nSo far, Republican lawmakers have largely defended Trump and Musk. Facing a raucous crowd in Nebraska in March, Rep. Mike Flood acknowledged: “I get it, there’s a lot of people in this room that don’t support what DOGE is doing.”\n\n“But for the first time we are making some progress identifying places that we can reduce the budget,” he added before being drowned out by boos.\n\nMusk initially boasted that he could cut $2 trillion from the nation’s roughly $6.8 trillion federal budget, which is more money than the federal government spends on defense, education, veterans’ health combined. He walked back his goal in early January, saying that $1 trillion would be “an epic outcome,” and reportedly seemed to lower the total to $150 billion for the coming fiscal year at a Cabinet meeting earlier this month.\n\nEven so, the early returns don’t come close to adding up to major savings, raising the prospect that DOGE will create costly chaos without increasing efficiency.\n\nDOGE has claimed to have saved $160 billion, as of April 20, from a combination of selling assets, canceling or renegotiating leases and contracts, ending grants, deleting fraudulent and improper payments, reducing the workforce and overhauling regulations and programs.\n\nBut Nat Malkus, a senior fellow at the right-leaning American Enterprise Institute, contends that DOGE’s math doesn’t add up.\n\n“They are overvaluing the contracts and overvaluing the savings beyond what any reasonable person would accept as true savings,” he said.\n\nDOGE typically lists the savings as the difference between the maximum potential amount of the contract and the amount the agency has agreed to pay so far, according to Malkus. However, the savings should be the difference between the amount agreed to and what has actually been paid to date, he argued.\n\nIn late March, DOGE claimed nearly $19 billion in contract savings, but by Malkus’ calculations, the amount was actually less than $10 billion.\n\nWhat’s more, canceling contracts doesn’t actually save the agency anything, said Rachel Snyderman, managing director of economic policy at the Bipartisan Policy Center. The unused money just goes back to the agency, which can ask Congress to redirect it other agency needs. Or the White House can ask lawmakers to rescind the funds.\n\nThe administration and congressional Republicans are currently discussing a recission package. They are also working on tax cut legislation that could add trillions more to the $36 trillion federal debt that Trump has promised to pay down, in part with savings generated by DOGE.\n\nMusk has asserted, without evidence, there’s hundreds of billions of dollars in waste, fraud and abuse in federal programs, including Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. Budget experts are doubtful of his claims.\n\n“Eliminating waste, fraud and abuse in those programs and across the government alone cannot get us out of the fiscal hole we are in,” Snyderman said.\n\nPutting a real dent in America’s deficit would require reforming mandatory spending programs, including Social Security and Medicare.\n\n“The Department of Education is not the reason why we have a $36 trillion national debt,” Snyderman said.\n\nThe ultimate impact of DOGE’s imprint on the federal government may be decided by the outcome of more than 100 lawsuits filed challenging DOGE-related actions, covering everything from the dismantling of several agencies to whether DOGE can access data from the IRS, the Treasury Department and the Social Security Administration, among others.\n\nA week after his November victory, Trump announced that Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy would lead the newly created Department of Government Efficiency, appearing to reward two of his biggest campaign backers with the equivalent of a blue-ribbon commission on cutting government spending.\n\nMusk and his team had bigger plans in mind.\n\nMusk found a home in an obscure government office – the Obama administration-created US Digital Service – while the team he assembled fanned out across the Trump transition agency teams to hit the ground running on January 20.\n\nDOGE’s first big target was the US Agency for International Development.\n\nLess than two weeks into Trump’s presidency, DOGE personnel went into USAID headquarters to gain access to the agency’s data security systems and personnel files. Musk’s lieutenants sought to shut off USAID payments.\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio was named acting administrator and would go on to cancel 83% of USAID contracts. USAID employees around the world were placed on leave and ordered to return to the US.\n\nThe cancellation of contracts rapidly created a vacuum around the globe, as administration even cut programs that had been granted waivers by the State Department for doing life-saving work.\n\nMusk boasted that he had “spent the weekend feeding USAID into the wood chipper.”\n\nAt the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau – an agency long criticized by Republicans that was created to root out abusive practices of financial institutions – the DOGE team was given access to the bureau’s systems and deleted the CFPB Twitter account.\n\nTrump budget chief Russell Vought, a “Project 2025” co-author, was put atop the agency directed the CFPB to stop virtually all work. The Trump administration is seeking to cut 90% of the CFPB workforce – roughly 1,500 of the bureau’s 1,700 employees – though the layoffs are currently paused while they’re being litigated in court.\n\nDOGE’s penchant to move fast and break things has thrown the Social Security Administration into disarray. The agency – which distributes monthly benefits to more than 73 million retirees, people with disabilities and others – is in the midst of a massive restructuring, which acting commissioner Leland Dudek acknowledged is being led by DOGE and the White House. Dudek told Social Security advocates that some of the changes typically would take two years to complete, but the Trump administration was pushing to enact them in a matter of weeks.\n\nThe agency was forced to walk back a significant policy change proposed in the name of combatting fraud because of the chaos it sparked for beneficiaries, who flooded Social Security’s telephone lines and field offices concerned that their payments could be interrupted.\n\nAt the IRS, DOGE staffers have been among the driving forces of a plan to hand over access to sensitive taxpayer data to immigration agencies to hasten deportations of suspected undocumented immigrants.\n\nCareer officials repeatedly refused, arguing to the DOGE team that doing so would be illegal. But their concerns were rebuffed, and the fight led to the departures of two acting IRS commissioners and roughly a half-dozen other top officials.\n\nOne of Musk’s first actions after Trump took office was to send an email to most of the 2.4 million federal workers with the subject line “Fork in the Road,” offering a buyout if they agreed to leave their job. (Some positions were exempted for reasons like national security.) The email mimicked the subject line of a note Musk sent Twitter employees amid his hostile overhaul of the social media giant.\n\nThe “Fork in the Road” email was just one way that Musk has pushed for agencies to reduce headcount.\n\nThe Trump administration has targeted probationary employees, indiscriminately firing thousands of employees who were new to their current job – though not necessarily new to federal work. Employees who worked in diversity, equity and inclusion programs were laid off at federal agencies as part of Trump’s directive to end DEI programs.\n\n“I feel like the cruelty is the point, if I am being honest,” said a federal worker who was terminated in February.\n\nMost federal agencies have separately offered incentives for employees to take early retirement, voluntary separation or deferred resignation.\n\nIn part to hit deeper reductions DOGE is seeking, each federal agency submitted a “reduction in force” plan. The Department of Education – another agency Trump wants to eliminate – announced in March it was cutting nearly 50% of its workforce, while Health and Human Services said earlier this month it would cut 20,000 of 82,000 full-time employees.\n\nFor the workers still on the job, the DOGE officials now inside agencies have created a culture of fear, federal employees say.\n\nIn February, DOGE again used its mass email system through the Office of Personnel Management to ask every federal worker: “What did you do last week?”\n\nOn X, Musk went even further than the unsigned email, which was sent at his direction, with a threatening addendum: “Failure to respond will be taken as a resignation.”\n\nThe surprise email missive sparked consternation among Trump’s Cabinet, and several agency leaders told employees not to respond. It was one of the first times that Trump’s Cabinet had contradicted the DOGE chief.\n\nEven with the deep DOGE-led cuts that agencies are undertaking, it’s still not enough for some. In recent weeks, at least seven departments have reopened their deferred resignation offers, which allow employees to stop working but be paid through September 30.\n\nThe new offers came with a warning from some agencies.\n\n“At this time, we cannot give you full assurance regarding which positions will remain – or where they will be located – after USDA’s restructuring,” said the US Department of Agriculture email, which CNN has viewed.', 'A political backlash beyond Washington', 'Published 10:30 AM EDT, Sat April 26, 2025', 'just-never-been-anything-like-doge-inside-elon-musks-turbulent-takeover-of-government-in-trumps-first-100-days-1745808373'),

But as the highest-ranking official of the United States to ever set foot on the world’s largest island, Vance is there to talk about a much longer stay — to drive home President Donald Trump’s desire to control the snowy land.\n\n“This has to happen,” Vance says. “And the reason it has to happen, I hate to say it, is because our friends in Denmark have not done their job in keeping this area safe.”\n\nFor months, the Danes have effectively said the only threat is from the United States. They’ve pointed out that Greenland, an autonomous land under the Danish umbrella, has happily hosted American military forces for decades. They note that Vance’s stop is at a US base established in 1943 and still operating. They argue the White House can easily keep an eye on Chinese and Russian movements in northern waters from the island and can even expand America’s military footprint there without owning the earth beneath it. Anyway, Denmark says, Greenland is not for sale. Locals give an icier answer to Trump, Vance and their representatives: “We don’t want you here.”\n\n“We need Greenland,” Trump says as if he’s not heard a word. “For international security. We have to have Greenland.”\n\nSince returning to power, Trump has revived talk of a concept born in the mid-1800s. Manifest Destiny is the idea that the United States is an exceptional nation created by God to rule all of North America — at the least. The concept was used to justify slavery, take land from Indigenous people and expand the country ever farther westward — starting several armed conflicts along the way. President Andrew Jackson, who ordered the brutal removal of many Native Americans from their ancestral homes, was a big fan, and Trump is a fan of his, hanging a portrait of Jackson in the Oval Office.\n\nTrump is also casting his eyes beyond Greenland. Citing unproven claims of Chinese soldiers operating the Panama Canal, he said at his inauguration, “We didn’t give it to China. We gave it to Panama, and we’re taking it back.”\n\nAlthough some Chinese companies have set up shop near the path between the seas, the Panamanian president called Trump’s claim “nonsense.” But a clause in the agreement that returned the canal to Panamanian control does permit the US to militarily “protect and defend” the vital waterway if America thinks it is being threatened. And Trump has unilaterally declared a threat does exist.\n\nTrump also has grown covetous of war-torn Gaza, saying maybe the US should be given the deed. “We’ll own it,” he says. “We’re going to take over that piece, develop it and create thousands and thousands of jobs, and it will be something the entire Middle East can be proud of … the Riviera of the Middle East.” He even posts what looks to be an AI-generated, lurid video of what a luxury resort might look like, complete with a giant golden statue of himself.\n\nHis reliable defender, Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, meets the scheme with a master class in understatement. “We’ll see what the Arab world says, but you know that’d be problematic at many, many levels.” Arab communities in the Middle East rapidly and broadly reject the proposal. Michigan Democratic Rep. Rashida Tlaib — the first Palestinian American woman to serve in Congress — calls Trump’s idea “fanatical bullshit.”\n\nSo that might be difficult. And then there is Canada.\n\n“When I say they should be a state, I mean that. I really mean that,” Trump says. “It’s right next to us on our border. It would be a great state. It would be a cherished state.”\n\nHe’s griped endlessly about allegedly unfair Canadian trade practices (even though he negotiated and signed the current trade deal during his last term) and now he is pushing his solution: Let the US pick up the Great White North like a doughnut at Tim Hortons.\n\nCanadians, despite their reputation as some of the most polite people on Earth, respond to the threats — and Trump’s threatened tariffs on the nation — by “dropping the gloves.” At hockey games they boo the American national anthem. Shops remove American products from their shelves, and “Buy Canadian” becomes a rallying cry from Newfoundland to the Yukon.\n\nWhen the two countries’ national teams are set to drop the puck in the championship game of the 4 Nations Face-Off tournament, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt quips, “We look forward to the United States beating our soon-to-be 51st state.”\n\nThe Canadians win in overtime, proving that adage of international relations: Never bet against a pass to Connor McDavid.\n\nWhile each nation targeted by Trump has taken his words seriously, some of his aspirations are decidedly more perilous, as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky finds out in late February.\n\nHe’s been summoned to the White House to seal a deal giving the United States rights to rare earth minerals in his country. Zelensky has acknowledged continued American support for Ukraine is crucial to defending itself against Russia. Trump has said he is brokering a broader peace deal with Moscow.\n\n“Oh, you’re all dressed up,” Trump says as Zelensky appears in black military attire, including a zip-up top emblazoned with Ukraine’s state symbol, a small trident representing the identity and self-determination of his country. The outfit is his trademark and a ready reminder to the world that his citizens are fighting and dying in a war they did not choose. But Trump is in his typical blue suit and red tie, and to some observers, his greeting drips with sarcasm.\n\nNonetheless, for 40 minutes their talk is cordial, with papers lined up for signing and lunch waiting. Then Vance jumps in to say Zelensky does not seem grateful enough for the diplomacy Trump is shepherding.\n\nZelensky looks befuddled. “What kind of diplomacy, JD, are you talking about?”\n\nVance fires back: “The kind that will end the destruction of your country.”\n\nHe accuses Zelensky of being disrespectful. The Ukrainian leader, who is interested in hearing how Washington might help deter Moscow’s aggression, essentially says Russian President Vladimir Putin can’t be trusted to abide by any agreement without muscle.\n\nTrump, who has openly fawned over Putin and famously sided with him over American intelligence officers, has had enough.\n\n“You’re, right now, not really in a very good position,” he warns Zelensky. “You don’t have the cards right now.”\n\n“I’m not playing cards,” Zelensky says.\n\nShouting starts. Trump calls former President Joe Biden “stupid” for giving the Ukrainians so much money for the fight, and he invokes the idea of a World War III. Zelensky is battered on all sides. He and his party leave.\n\nPerhaps Zelensky should have seen it coming.\n\nBefore the meeting, Trump had falsely called the Ukrainian leader a “dictator” while refusing to pin the same tag on Putin. The American president had accused Ukraine of starting the war, although Russian forces indisputably rolled tanks and opened fire across the border in its latest invasion three years ago. Trump had started peace talks with Russia without inviting Zelensky, and he had signaled that Ukraine would almost certainly have to give up some, if not all, the land Russia had occupied.\n\nAnd Trump had bristled when Zelensky said prior to their explosive meeting that the American president was “surrounded by misinformation” — a comment close political observers suspected Trump took as an insult.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Jack Reed of Rhode Island watches the diplomatic meltdown and concludes Zelensky walked into “a political ambush and a shameful failure of American leadership.”\n\nTrump briefly withholds partial American intelligence from the Ukrainian forces. Zelensky expresses regret over the tone of the meeting. The peace talks, such as they are, continue. But despite Trump’s frequent campaign promises that he could and would end the war on “Day 1” of his new term, months are passing.\n\nThe fighting goes on.\n\nAnother battle Trump is waging with limited effect was also tied to a “Day 1” pledge.\n\n“I will declare a national emergency at our southern border,” he said in his inaugural address. “All illegal entry will immediately be halted, and we will begin the process of returning millions and millions of criminal aliens back to the places from which they came.”\n\nThe boast was taken so seriously, human rights activists warned of vast detention camps springing up near the border where people would be herded and held until they were whisked out of the country.\n\n“It’ll begin very early, very quickly,” Trump told NBC News.\n\nSoon camera crews were following armed squads of agents fanning out to find, seize and deport masses of targeted individuals. But ride-along videos did not reveal thousands of dramatic arrests so much as hours of tedious, costly searching that sometimes netted a single person, a few or none.\n\nThere were some photo ops of people being hustled onto planes and sent away, but a month into the effort, White House border czar Tom Homan was asked about the pace by CNN’s Dana Bash.\n\n“You’ve said roughly 14,000 migrants have been arrested … and that’s well below the 1,500 daily arrests the president has said he wants to see,” she said.\n\n“I’m not happy with the numbers,” Homan admits, “because we’ve got a lot of criminals to find, so what we’re talking about right now is increasing the number of teams … and I’ll be honest with you, sanctuary cities are causing us a lot of work. … It’s hard work, but we’re not giving up.”\n\nGenerally, as the weeks progress, the pace of deportations has held steady compared to last year under Biden. There are plenty of reasons beyond the difficulty of finding people who don’t want to be found. Nations must agree to accept the deportees, transportation must be arranged, and despite the president dispatching military troops to help protect the southern border, some people are still coming in as others are sent out.\n\nAnd of course, legal challenges to the deportations must be heard. Or maybe not.\n\nEl Salvador’s Center for Terrorism Confinement, or CECOT, is a sprawling complex of towers, guards, steel bars and razor ribbon at the base of a volcano. Under tight security, inmates are handcuffed and frog-marched in white shorts from place to place, and some can wind up in solitary cells devoid of light save what filters through a small hole in the ceiling. With a capacity of 40,000, the prison was opened in 2023 as an answer to an explosion in extreme gang violence in El Salvador.\n\nCNN’s David Culver visits and says the facility “isn’t just a prison, it’s a message from this government to the gangs and really to the rest of the world.”\n\nFor the Trump White House, it is also a solution.\n\nIn mid-March, the administration loads hundreds of people collected in immigration sweeps onto planes and sends them south, alleging they are tied to dangerous criminal activity. The US is paying the government of El Salvador $6 million to take them, and even though a tense battle breaks out with a federal judge over the flights, the deportees wind up incarcerated at CECOT — among them, a Maryland man named Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia.\n\nAnd suddenly Team Trump has a new problem.\n\nA working man with a wife and children, Abrego Garcia is 29 and his attorney says he has no criminal record or ties to gangs. Indeed, his attorneys say he fled El Salvador as a teenager under threat from the very dangerous groups for which CECOT was built. When US immigration officials found him living on the East Coast without documentation in 2019, a judge took the danger to his life seriously enough to say he could be deported but not back to El Salvador.\n\nConfronted with the evidence, administration officials tell the court: “The United States concedes that removal (of Abrego Garcia) to El Salvador was an administrative error.” The court says the White House must bring him back. The Supreme Court says a version of the same. Then things get really messy.\n\n“First and foremost, he was illegally in our country.” US Attorney General Pam Bondi echoes White House claims that this is the business of the executive branch, not the courts; that the Justice Department believes Abrego Garcia really is a gang member, though they have offered no public proof; that El Salvador has him now — and that the White House has no right to tell a foreign government what to do.\n\nWhen President Nayib Bukele of El Salvador visits Trump in the Oval Office, the argument becomes a feedback loop of resistance. Asked by CNN’s Kaitlan Collins whether he will return the Maryland man, Bukele smiles and says, “How can I smuggle a terrorist into the United States? Of course, I’m not going to do it.”\n\nTrump not only expresses admiration for the hard line of the Central American leader, he also says he’d like to send more people – maybe even Americans accused of violent crimes – to CECOT.\n\n“I don’t know what the laws are; we always have to obey the laws,” Trump says, “but we also have homegrown criminals … that are absolute monsters. I’d like to include them in the group of people to get them out of the country.”\n\nAmid growing evidence the Trump administration is doing little to comply with certain court orders, former US Attorney Harry Litman sums up the episode in a sentence: “It is way, way beyond the pale and just contempt for the Constitution and the rule of law.”\n\nNew York Times reporter Adam Liptak, who covers the Supreme Court, says on “The Daily” podcast that as a legal matter, the same argument the White House used against Abrego Garcia’s return could be used against anyone, including US citizens. He says the White House is essentially saying, we arrested this person and sent him to a foreign prison without due process because we were in a presidentially declared emergency. We made a mistake. But now we can’t bring him back. “The logic and implications of the administration’s position can only be called deeply disturbing,” Liptak says.\n\nWhen a judge argues there is reasonable evidence to hold White House officials in criminal contempt for stonewalling the court’s orders in regard to some of the deportation flights – including the one with Abrego Garcia aboard - some political watchers fear Trump’s actions are pushing the nation ever closer to a constitutional crisis. Yet the White House seems to be declaring itself unanswerable to the courts or Congress, but a supreme power — not to be challenged, questioned or stopped by anyone.\n\nCNN’s Kaanita Iyer contributed to this report.', 'Aspirations for a Ukraine-Russia deal', 'Published 6:00 AM EDT, Sat April 26, 2025', 'american-battleground-trump-dreams-of-empire-while-struggling-to-keep-some-promises-1745808373'),

And in the wake of the cancellations, Washington’s Capital Pride Alliance has disassociated itself from the Kennedy Center.\n\n“We are a resilient community, and we have found other avenues to celebrate,” said June Crenshaw, deputy director of the alliance. “We are finding another path to the celebration … but the fact that we have to maneuver in this way is disappointing.”\n\nThe Kennedy Center’s website still lists Tapestry of Pride on its website with a general description and a link to the World Pride site. There are no other details.\n\nThe Kennedy Center did not respond to a request from the AP for comment.\n\nThe move comes on the heels of massive changes at the Kennedy Center, with President Donald Trump firing both the president and chairman in early February. Trump replaced most of the board with loyalists, who then elected him the new Kennedy Center chairman.\n\nThe World Pride event, held every two years, starts in just under a month — running from May 17 through June 8 with performances and celebrations planned across the capital city. But Trump administration policies on transgender rights and comments about Kennedy Center drag performances have sparked concern about what kind of reception attendees will receive.\n\n“I know that D.C. as a community will be very excited to be hosting World Pride, but I know the community is a little bit different than the government,” said Michael Roest, founder and director of the International Pride Orchestra, which had its June 5 performance at the Kennedy Center abruptly canceled within days of Trump’s takeover.\n\nRoest told the AP he was in the final stages of planning the Kennedy Center performance after months of emails and Zoom calls. He was waiting on a final contract when Trump posted on social media Feb. 7 of the leadership changes and his intention to transform the Kennedy Center’s programming.\n\nImmediately the Kennedy Center became nonresponsive, Roest said. On Feb. 12, he said, he received a one-sentence email from a Kennedy Center staffer stating, “We are no longer able to advance your contract at this time.”\n\n“They went from very eager to host to nothing,” he said. “We have not since heard a word from anybody at the Kennedy Center, but that’s not going to stop us.”\n\nIn the wake of the cancellation, Roest said he managed to move the International Pride Orchestra performance to the Strathmore theater in nearby Bethesda, Maryland.\n\nCrenshaw said some other events, including a drag story time and a display of parts of the AIDS Memorial Quilt, would be moved to the World Pride welcome center in Chinatown.\n\nMonica Alford, a veteran arts and culture journalist and event planner, was scheduled to organize an event June 8 as part of Tapestry of Pride, but said she also saw communication abruptly end within days of Trump’s takeover.\n\nAlford has a long history with the Kennedy Center and organized the first-ever drag brunch on the Kennedy Center rooftop in 2024, and said she regarded the institution — and its recent expansion known as The Reach — as “my home base” and “a safe space for the queer community”\n\nShe said she was still finalizing the details of her event, which she described as “meant to be family-friendly, just like the drag brunch was family-friendly and classy and sophisticated.”\n\nShe said she mourns the loss of the partnership she nurtured with the Kennedy Center.\n\n“We’re doing our community a disservice — not just the queer community but the entire community,” she said.\n\nRoest said he never received an explanation as to why the performance was canceled so late in the planning stages. He said his orchestra would no longer consider performing at the Kennedy Center, and he believes most queer artists would make the same choice.\n\n“There would need to be a very, very public statement of inclusivity from the administration, from that board, for us to consider that,” he said. “Otherwise it is a hostile performance space.”', '', 'Published 4:33 AM EDT, Sat April 26, 2025', 'kennedy-centers-lgbtq-pride-events-canceled-1745808373'),

A statement read aloud in court and provided to the students’ attorneys said that “ICE is developing a policy that will provide a framework for SEVIS record terminations.” Additionally, officials said they will not base cancellations solely on whether a student comes up in a search of the National Crime Information Center.\n\nIn the meantime, officials said they would stop issuing new revocations based on those searches until the process was completed.\n\nBy Friday evening, more than 240 SEVIS accounts had been restored across 64 different schools, according to a preliminary CNN tally. Lawyers representing students who have filed legal action in New Hampshire, Georgia and Pennsylvania also told CNN that their clients were receiving notices of reinstatement from their schools.\n\nDuring a hearing Friday, a Justice Department attorney said ICE was in the process of reinstating the records of all the students who had been terminated in that process, not just those who had filed lawsuits.\n\nStill, attorneys said ICE will continue to exercise discretion to terminate student records in other instances.\n\n“ICE still maintains the authority to terminate a SEVIS record for other reasons,” the DOJ said in a new statement submitted in the court cases. “Such as if a student fails to maintain his or her nonimmigrant status after the record is reactivated, or engages in other unlawful activity that would render him or her removable from the United States under the Immigration and Nationality Act.”\n\nIn dozens of cases across the country, international students have sued the administration over ICE’s effort to cancel their immigration records in the SEVIS database.\n\nThe database, which is operated by the Department of Homeland Security, tracks the immigration status of international students and is used by universities to maintain information about the students’ enrollment.\n\nThe SEVIS revocations occurred alongside visa cancellations for many students, putting them ultimately at risk for deportation, multiple attorneys representing students have said in court documents. The DOJ continues to claim that SEVIS changes did not cause visa terminations.\n\nThe Trump administration began to cancel visas and launched deportation proceedings in March, which initially targeted students who participated in protests against the Israel-Hamas war on college campuses last year.\n\nThe blitz of enforcement caused panic and fear among international students, resulted in some detentions and at least two self-deportations. Weeks later, immigration officials began revoking students’ immigration statuses over minor legal infractions and in some cases without any apparent explanation.\n\nSeveral federal judges have halted some of the revocations and issued restraining orders to make sure that students are not removed from the country.\n\nThe cases revealed that ICE was justifying the records terminations by arguing that the students had an alleged “criminal history,” including students who were arrested and never charged, or who had their charges dismissed.\n\nWhile the restoration of student statuses is likely to calm fears among thousands of international students who worried the revocation of their status would put them at risk for deportation it does not appear to impact other international students whose visas were revoked, including Rumeysa Ozturk, the Tufts University student who was arrested near her home in Massachusetts, and Mahmoud Khalil, the Columbia University graduate and legal permanent resident who was arrested near his home on campus after being accused of engaging in activities in support of Hamas.\n\nIn recent weeks, ICE appeared to cancel students’ SEVIS statuses for minor legal infractions including drunk driving and traffic violations, according to multiple lawsuits filed to stop the cancellations, with some students seeing records cancelled even if they had never been convicted of a crime. Students like Dartmouth University graduate researcher Xiaotian Liu, a Chinese national who is studying computer science and has been in the United States since 2016. Liu’s status was changed without notice earlier this month despite him never having committed a crime or a traffic violation, according to his attorney. A judge recently issued a restraining order to prevent any government action on Liu.\n\n“It is clear that the deluge of legal filings and initial judicial rulings in New Hampshire and nationwide have had a profound impact on the government’s decision to reactivate the SEVIS records of some students and allow them to continue their studies,” Gilles Bissonnette, Legal Director of the ACLU of New Hampshire, which is representing Liu. “Many questions remain, including the criteria that will be used for these reactivations and whether this will apply to students who did not file lawsuits.”\n\nThe vast majority of students who have had their visas and statuses revoked have not been detained or deported, but they have said the status revocation prevents them from continuing their coursework and to work at their campus-related jobs, which in turn threatens their immigration status.\n\nForeign students, who typically hold an F-1 visa, are required to meet specific criteria to maintain their status including full-time course work and no outside employment.\n\nSome 4,700 students saw their records abruptly changed as part of the administration’s gambit, according to the American Immigration Lawyers Association.\n\n“ICE is now officially pulling back from its disastrous and harmful actions that terminated the status of nearly 5,000 students with visas but only after AILA members and others filed dozens of lawsuits,” Gregory Chen, AILA’s senior director of government relations, said in a statement. “While ICE pulling back on its massive mistake now gives some relief to thousands of people, there are still long-term harms that continue to hurt these students and their families as well as American universities, research institutions and businesses.“\n\nWhile the administration is arguing that its reinstatement of the records should defuse the quick-moving court fights over the SEVIS terminations, at least one judge on Friday continued to probe the administration’s actions.\n\nSenior District Judge Jeffrey White, who sits in San Francisco, is requesting that the administration submit additional information about the new statement. He also grilled the DOJ attorneys on several questions he had asked them to prepare for ahead of the hearing.\n\nAttorneys for the students, meanwhile, argued that ICE’s announcement did not address all the issues that had arisen because of the records’ termination.\n\nOne of those attorneys, John Sinodis called the new ICE statement “woefully inadequate” as he asked what it would mean for students who left the country because their records had been terminated. Would they be given a new visa to reenter, he asked. Will ICE arrest and detain those whose visas were revoked?\n\nThe judge himself seemed skeptical that the issues before him had been fully resolved, pushing back when a DOJ attorney urged him to consider that there was a “new world order” with Friday’s announcement.\n\n“It seems like, from this administration, there’s a new world order every single day,” Judge White said.\n\nCNN’s Taylor Galgano and Caroll Alvarado contributed to this report.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments.', 'ICE’s tampering with records put thousands of international students in limbo', 'Updated 12:20 AM EDT, Sat April 26, 2025', 'trump-backs-down-in-legal-fight-over-canceling-international-students-status-records-for-now-1745808373');

She made an initial appearance in court and was released.\n\nThe arrest on federal charges is an escalation in the Trump administration’s focus on judges’ conduct, particularly as it relates to immigration enforcement. The Justice Department has repeatedly asserted that it will investigate any local officials who do not assist federal authorities on immigration matters.\n\n“We believe Judge Dugan intentionally misdirected federal agents away from the subject to be arrested in her courthouse, Eduardo Flores-Ruiz, allowing the subject — an illegal alien — to evade arrest,” FBI Director Kash Patel said on X in a post Friday morning. “Thankfully our agents chased down the perp on foot and he’s been in custody since, but the Judge’s obstruction created increased danger to the public.”\n\nIn court on Friday, Dugan’s attorney said that “Judge Dugan wholeheartedly regrets and protests her arrest. It was not made in the interest of public safety,” according to the AP.\n\nIn charging documents, investigators said that plainclothes federal agents went to Dugan’s courtroom on April 18 with the intention of arresting Flores-Ruiz. A Mexican immigrant, Flores-Ruiz had been removed from the United States in 2013, but immigration officials learned he was back in the country illegally because of his arrest in a local domestic abuse case.\n\nAfter being informed of the agents’ presence by her courtroom deputy, the judge “became visibly angry, commented that the situation was ‘absurd,’ left the bench, and entered chambers,” court documents say.\n\nWitnesses told investigators that Dugan confronted the federal agents in a public hallway, where she repeatedly demanded they leave, saying they needed a different kind of warrant to make the arrest. Dugan ordered the agents to speak with the chief judge of the courthouse.\n\nSeveral witnesses – including Dugan’s courtroom deputy and both the prosecutor and the Victim Witness Specialist on Flores-Ruiz’s case – allegedly recounted seeing Dugan then direct Flores-Ruiz and his attorney to leave through a “jury door,” which leads to a nonpublic area of the courthouse, court documents say.\n\nOne of the witnesses told investigators that Dugan stopped the two as they tried to exit through the normal door to the courtroom, saying something to the effect of “wait, come with me.”\n\nFlores-Ruiz and his attorney quickly exited the courthouse before the agents were able to catch up to them, investigators say. Agents found Flores-Ruiz outside the courthouse and identified themselves. He took off running but was eventually captured.\n\nCNN has reached out to Flores-Ruiz’s attorney for comment. Flores-Ruiz has not yet entered a plea to federal charges related to his efforts to evade arrest and is being detained, according to his court record. This is a separate case from the charges against Dugan.\n\nOfficials from the Trump administration quickly touted the arrest as an important step in achieving their immigration crackdown, and holding figures they view as corrupt responsible.\n\nAttorney General Pam Bondi said in an interview on Fox News after the arrest was executed that “if you are destroying evidence and you are obstructing justice, when you have victims sitting in a courtroom of domestic violence and you are escorting a criminal defendant out the back door, it will not be tolerated.”\n\n“I think some of these judges think they are beyond and above the law, and they are not,” Bondi added.\n\nTrump’s border czar Tom Homan similarly said in a post on X that “nobody should be surprised by the arrest of two judges.” The second judge he is referring to is former magistrate Judge Joel Cano, who is charged with harboring three alleged gang members on his property.\n\n“If you actively impede our enforcement efforts or if you knowingly harbor or conceal illegal aliens from ICE you will be prosecuted,” he said.\n\nOpponents of the administration, however, have attacked the arrest as a threat to the legal system.\n\nWisconsin Gov. Tony Evers, a Democrat, said in a statement that the Trump administration has used “dangerous rhetoric to attack and attempt to undermine our judiciary at every level,” and emphasized that the “fundamental demand of justice in America” is defendants are innocent until proven guilty.\n\n“I will continue to put my faith in our justice system as this situation plays out in the court of law,” his statement reads.\n\nMilwaukee Mayor Cavalier Johnson says the arrest could scare residents from coming to court, undermining public safety in the city.\n\nAnd democratic Rep. Gwen Moore, whose district includes Milwaukee, described Dugan’s arrest as “shocking” in a statement and said it has “all the hallmarks of overreach.”\n\n“Federal law enforcement coming into a community and arresting a judge is a serious matter and would require high legal bar,” said Moore, adding she was “very alarmed at this increasingly lawless actions of the Trump Administration, and in particular ICE, who have been defying courts and acting with disregard for the Constitution.”\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments.\n\nCNN’s Evan Perez and Katelyn Polantz contributed to this report.', 'Fight over Trump administration’s methods and priorities', 'Updated 7:43 PM EDT, Fri April 25, 2025', 'wisconsin-judge-arrested-and-charged-in-federal-court-for-allegedly-obstructing-immigration-agents-1745808373'),

Earlier this year, President Donald Trump revived a policy from his first term that allows federal officials to make immigration-related arrests in courts.\n\nBut as in so-called sanctuary cities around the US, court officials are not obligated to work with federal officials in such arrests if the warrant being executed is an administrative warrant and not a judicial one.\n\nSuch was the case for Eduardo Flores-Ruiz, who federal officials were attempting to arrest on April 18, the day he was appearing before Dugan in a criminal matter. After learning that the officials were in possession of an administrative warrant for Flores-Ruiz, the judge allegedly helped him and his attorney leave through a nonpublic area of the courthouse. Flores-Ruiz was arrested by federal agents shortly thereafter.\n\n“Without a (judicial) warrant, there obviously would literally be no obligation for her to cooperate. It would only happen if there was a warrant,” Jeff Swartz, a former Florida state judge, told CNN’s Brianna Keilar on “CNN News Central.” “She has no obligation to assist at all with the apprehension of that particular defendant in a civil matter.”\n\nFormer federal prosecutor Elie Honig said that it’s likely Dugan wouldn’t be facing the federal charges had she only declined to cooperate with the agents that day.\n\nFor her conduct to result in the charges she’s facing, he said, “there needs to be some affirmative act taken. And here, showing this person the back door, giving this person access to the back door, and then ushering the person out the back door would be an affirmative act.”\n\nBut Honig, a CNN legal analyst, stressed that prosecutors have to take into account a host of factors when deciding whether bringing obstruction charges are “appropriate and necessary.”\n\nIn this case, he said, there are legitimate questions about whether pursuing charges against Dugan could represent prosecutorial overreach.\n\nDugan’s attorney, Steven Biskupic, said in a statement later Friday that his client “has committed herself to the rule of law and the principles of due process for her entire career as a lawyer and a judge.”\n\n“Judge Dugan will defend herself vigorously, and looks forward to being exonerated,” he added.\n\nDugan’s arrest is not the first time the Justice Department under Trump has accused a sitting judge of helping an undocumented immigrant evade an immigration officer.\n\nIn 2019, a Massachusetts state judge was indicted on obstruction of justice and other federal charges, which were later dropped during the Biden administration.\n\n“I think the canary in the coal mine was the Shelley Joseph case in Massachusetts, Gertner said.\n\nShe and other experts CNN spoke with said the way that case was handled was much more measured than how the Justice Department has handled Dugan’s, underscoring the political nature of the new matter.\n\nGertner, for example, emphasized the fact that Dugan was arrested for a white-collar offense, while the Massachusetts judge – Shelley Richmond Joseph – was not taken into custody.\n\n“I can’t emphasize enough how preposterous that is,” Gertner said. “This is not an individual who’s going to flee. This is not an individual who’s a threat to the community.”\n\nThe experts also pointed to the public statements Trump administration officials made touting Dugan’s case as evidence of their intention to use her prosecution for political ends.\n\nAmong those officials are Attorney General Pam Bondi, who said in an interview on Fox News after the arrest was executed that “if you are destroying evidence and you are obstructing justice, when you have victims sitting in a courtroom of domestic violence and you are escorting a criminal defendant out the back door, it will not be tolerated.”\n\n“I think some of these judges think they are beyond and above the law, and they are not,” Bondi added.\n\nDoug Keith, who serves as senior counsel at the Brennan Center for Justice’s Judiciary Program, said it’s possible that more dramatic episodes could arise as the Trump administration continues seeking widespread cooperation in its deportation campaign.\n\n“Unfortunately, I don’t think this is the last conflict we will see like this,” Keith said.\n\n“The policy change that ICE made around courthouse arrests on January 21 has created these circumstances in which we should expect to see chaos like this play out in more courthouses across the country,” he added.\n\nCNN’s Hannah Rabinowitz and Michael Williams contributed to this report.', '‘Canary in the coal mine’', 'Published 6:23 PM EDT, Fri April 25, 2025', 'prosecution-of-wisconsin-judge-underscores-trump-administrations-aggressive-approach-to-immigration-enforcement-1745808373'),

The Justice Department coupled those seizures from news outlets with gag orders on the news organizations’ top leadership or lawyers, so even the journalists themselves didn’t know their records were being collected.\n\nThe Garland policy was widely considered a win for the protection of the free press.\n\nBondi, in her Justice Department-wide memo on Friday, said that federal law enforcement will continue to “employ procedural protections to limit” the seeking of news organization records. In the past, higher-level Justice Department officials had to sign off on the approaches.\n\n“These procedural protections recognize that investigative techniques relating to newsgathering are an extraordinary measure to be deployed as a last resort when essential to a successful investigation or prosecution,” the Bondi memo said.\n\nThe Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, a leading First Amendment advocacy organization, reiterated following Bondi’s announcement that journalistic work that relies on confidential sources should be protected.\n\n“Some of the most consequential reporting in U.S. history — from Watergate to warrantless wiretapping after 9/11 — was and continues to be made possible because reporters have been able to protect the identities of confidential sources and uncover and report stories that matter to people across the political spectrum,” Bruce Brown, the Reporters Committee president, said in a statement.\n\n“Strong protections for journalists serve the American public by safeguarding the free flow of information,” Brown added.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details.', '', 'Updated 6:02 PM EDT, Fri April 25, 2025', 'attorney-general-bondi-rescinds-bidenera-protections-for-journalists-in-leak-investigations-1745808373'),

Constituents have challenged members of both parties on a range of topics, but Democrats – who have held more public, in-person town halls – have faced deep frustrations from voters who have said the party is not doing enough to counter the president.\n\nThe senator told attendees that “there is no magic button” he can push to unwind the Trump administration’s dismantling of federal agencies and overhaul of the federal workforce – drawing an impassioned response from one voter.\n\n“Why are there no calls for impeachment? This is unacceptable,” the woman shouted to cheers from the crowd. “I will not live in an authoritative country, and neither will any of these people. You can do more! Think outside the box! He needs to be impeached.”\n\nThe woman, who said she has a father who is a retired Army colonel, a son with autism and kids who attend a Title 1 school, urged Ossoff to be “brave.”\n\n“I like you, and I will vote for you if you are brave, and you do what we need,” she said. “We need him [Trump] to be impeached. We need him to be removed.”\n\nOssoff said he agreed, but the senator noted the unlikelihood of such an action in Congress, saying the only road to Trump’s impeachment is through a majority vote in the GOP-controlled House.\n\n“I agree with you, but as I said at the beginning, I also have no choice but to be candid with you about the situation that we face and the tools that are at our disposal,” he said. “As strongly as I agree with you, ma’am, and I regret if this is an unwelcome response, but my job is to be honest with you. The only way to achieve what you want to achieve is to have a majority in the United States House of Representatives and … believe me, I’m working on it every single day, every single day.”\n\nAnother audience member identified herself as a US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention worker who had been fired as part of DOGE’s mass layoffs.

It also impacts the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Federal Communications Commission, and US Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\n\nA fact sheet released by the White House said, “The President needs a responsive and accountable civil service to protect our national security.” And it specified that the order is aimed at stopping federal unions who have “declared war on President Trump’s agenda.”\n\nThe National Treasury Employees Union quickly filed a lawsuit seeking to block the executive order, arguing that nixing collective bargaining rights conflicts with the law that Congress passed to facilitate and strengthen collective bargaining among the federal workforce. The union, which says Trump’s directive would strip union rights from about two-thirds of its members, then filed a request for a preliminary injunction.\n\n“No president had ever tried to use the national security exemption in such a sweeping way,” Paras Shah, NTEU’s deputy general counsel, said during a hearing on Wednesday, pointing to the fact sheet and OPM’s guidance. “Those documents make clear that the executive orders objectives are twofold: First, to make federal employees easier to fire, and second, to exact political retribution against unions that stood up to the president’s agenda.”\n\nFriedman, who read from the fact sheet, also questioned Trump’s motive in issuing the order.\n\n“He’s willing to be kind to those that work with him.

Also, collective bargaining agreements can delay the implementation of policy changes that the president determines necessary for national security, she said.\n\n“Part of that very discretionary determination involves how agencies are able or unable, given the way that collective bargaining operates, to go ahead and implement changes as necessary for the national security,” she said.\n\nFriedman, however, also questioned the administration’s contention that certain agencies have national security as their primary function, citing the National Institutes of Health, Federal Emergency Management Agency and Department of Agriculture.', '', 'Published 4:51 PM EDT, Fri April 25, 2025', 'judge-halts-trumps-order-to-end-collective-bargaining-rights-for-many-federal-workers-1745808373'),

He rejected the idea that he is expanding the powers of the presidency, saying he is using the office, “as it was meant to be used” in his second term.\n\n“What I’m doing is exactly what I’ve campaigned on,” he said.\n\nThe president also trod on some familiar themes, including claiming, without evidence, that there was “cheating” in the 2020 and 2024 elections and that tariffs are good for the country.\n\nHere are nine moments that stuck out from the transcript of TIME’s Trump interview:\n\nTrump said in the interview that he’s made “200 deals” with companies and countries after pausing new tariffs on countries. But the White House hasn’t announced any of them, and Trump declined to detail any specific deals.\n\nAdditionally, Trump said if the US still had tariffs of 50% on foreign countries a year from now, he’d still consider that a “total victory” because “the country would be making a fortune.”\n\nAsked why he hasn’t announced the deals that have been agreed to, Trump said trade negotiations would be wrapped up in the next few weeks. Trump initiated the 90-day pause on April 9.\n\n“I would say, over the next three to four weeks, and we’re finished,” he said. “We’ll be finished.”\n\nStill, Trump left himself room for flexibility, saying some negotiations may continue beyond that benchmark: “Some countries may come back and ask for an adjustment, and I’ll consider that.”\n\nTrump maintained in the interview that talks are ongoing with China on tariffs, though Chinese officials are firmly stating the opposite.\n\nTrump even said that Chinese President Xi Jinping has called him, saying: “He’s called. And I don’t think that’s a sign of weakness on his behalf.” Trump did not offer specifics on the call or when it took place.\n\nHowever, when pressed by CNN Friday morning on if Trump has spoken to Xi since tariffs were implemented on Beijing, he declined to comment.\n\n“I don’t want to comment on that, but I’ve spoken to him many times,” Trump said in response to CNN’s Alayna Treene when leaving the South Lawn.\n\nTrump told TIME that he has not asked El Salvador’s President Nayib Bukele to send back Kilmar Abrego Garcia — an undocumented immigrant that US officials mistakenly deported to El Salvador — despite a Supreme Court ruling that said the Trump administration had to “facilitate” his return.\n\n“I haven’t,” Trump said. “He said he wouldn’t.”\n\nTrump generally deferred to Justice Department lawyers on most of TIME’s questions regarding Abrego Garcia’s status, including saying it was up to the attorneys if they want to start facilitating any return of Abrego Garcia.\n\n“At this moment, they just don’t want to do that. They say we’re in total compliance with the Supreme Court,” he said.\n\nTrump indicated to TIME that he is serious about making Canada the 51st US state — a message the allied nation has repeatedly bristled at.\n\n“I’m really not trolling,” Trump said.\n\n“We’re taking care of their military. We’re taking care of every aspect of their lives, and we don’t need them to make cars for us. In fact, we don’t want them to make cars for us,” Trump said. “We don’t need their lumber. We don’t need their energy. We don’t need anything from Canada. And I say the only way this thing really works is for Canada to become a state.”\n\nTrump added that he “wouldn’t mind” if his legacy as president included the expansion of territory.\n\nThe president has publicly flirted with running for president again in 2028, in violation of the 22nd Amendment that says presidents can only serve two terms. He indicated to TIME that while there are “some loopholes that have been discussed” to allow him to run again, he doesn’t “believe in using loopholes.”\n\n“I have more people begging me to run again, but I haven’t looked at even the possibility,” Trump added.\n\nThose statements run counter to comments Trump made at the end of March, when he said he was “not joking” about the possibility of running for a third term. The Trump Store, which is run by the Trump Organization, also started selling “Trump 2028” hats earlier this week.\n\nIf Republicans in Congress pass a party-line bill that involves large cuts to Medicaid, Trump vowed in the interview to veto it.\n\nGOP congressional leaders have said the planned cuts would only be from waste, fraud and abuse in Medicaid, but experts have questioned if those reductions would really add up to the $800 billion price tag that GOP leaders are aiming for in their party-line bill.\n\nTrump reiterated the goals to only cut “waste, fraud and abuse” in the interview, but said he would veto the bill if it involved other cuts to the program — likely welcome news to centrist Republican lawmakers who have said they would not back big cuts to Medicaid.\n\nAs part of the peace proposal to end the Russia-Ukraine war, Trump said “Crimea will stay with Russia” — which would breach international law that generally does not recognize forced territorial acquisitions. It would also contradict the first Trump administration’s own statement reaffirming “as policy its refusal to recognize the Kremlin’s claims of sovereignty over territory seized by force in contravention of international law.”\n\n“If Crimea will stay with Russia — we have to only talk about Crimea because that’s the one that always gets mentioned. Crimea will stay with Russia. And Zelensky understands that, and everybody understands that it’s been with them for a long time,” Trump said.\n\nPublicly, Zelensky has indicated that recognizing the occupation of Crimea is a red line for him in negotiations. He told reporters earlier this week: “Ukraine will not legally recognize the occupation of Crimea. There is nothing to talk about. It is against our constitution.” Putin invaded Crimea in February 2014.\n\nTrump also said Ukraine’s attempts to join NATO sparked Russia’s invasion — and the president said he doesn’t think Ukraine will “ever be able to join NATO.”\n\nTrump told TIME he wasn’t worried about Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu dragging the US into a potential future war with Iran, because he would go “willingly” if they couldn’t reach a nuclear deal with Iran.\n\n“I may go in very willingly if we can’t get a deal. If we don’t make a deal, I’ll be leading the pack,” Trump said, referring to the ongoing talks with Iran about a nuclear deal.\n\nTrump also denied reporting from the New York Times that he waved Israel off from attacking Iran during nuclear talks.\n\n“I didn’t stop them. But I didn’t make it comfortable for them, because I think we can make a deal without the attack,” Trump told TIME.\n\nTrump also said that he believes that Saudi Arabia will join the Abraham Accords, an agreement from Trump’s first term aimed at promoting peace in the Middle East, which was initially signed by Israel and the UAE.\n\n“I tell you what: I think Saudi Arabia will go into the Abraham Accords,” he said. Trump travels to Saudi Arabia next month on his second foreign trip.\n\n“We had four countries in there, it was all set. We would have had it packed.

The company has long been ingesting and processing data from multiple ICE and DHS sources. The latest endeavor, however, is expected to go further by identifying people with civil immigration violations.\n\n“If they are designing a deportation machine, they will be able to do that,” a former senior IRS employee with knowledge of the plans told CNN.\n\nAllowing streamlined access to highly protected information – for immigration enforcement purposes – has been the subject of ongoing legal challenges. Democratic lawmakers have slammed the plan, with one claiming DOGE is “rapidly, haphazardly, and unlawfully” exploiting Americans’ personal data.\n\nTrump officials see the project as a way to overcome a major hurdle: quickly building “targeting lists” that Immigration and Customs Enforcement can use to find, detain and deport migrants in the US. It’s part of a concerted effort, under pressure from the White House, to ramp up enforcement and increase deportations.\n\nCNN has reached out to the Department of Homeland Security, Palantir and DOGE for comment. It’s unclear when the master database will be operational.\n\nPalantir was co-founded by Peter Thiel, a Musk ally who has been a Trump supporter and donor. The company’s CEO, Alex Karp, is a Democratic donor and backed Kamala Harris last year.\n\nPalantir is already a well-known government contractor, including at the IRS, so it would be a “logical choice” for the DOGE teams to utilize it, a senior IRS official said, adding that, “it would be easy to change the scope of existing contracts and pay Palantir to do this stuff.”\n\n“They’re going to take the information we already have and put it into a system,” a Trump administration official told CNN about DOGE’s plans. “It will be able to rapidly queue information. Everyone is converting to Palantir.”\n\nThe DHS contract with Palantir includes “streamlining selection and apprehension operations of illegal aliens,” and self-deportation tracking, according to public records on a federal contracting site. ICE currently uses Palantir’s software for Homeland Security investigations.\n\nA big dataset would help immigration officials more quickly identify who is undocumented in the US and potentially eligible for deportation. So far, a challenge for officials has been building what they call “targeting lists” to arrest people without status. Some existing lists, sources say, have been riddled with errors, creating additional work for agents in the field to verify and vet information.\n\nBut former Homeland Security officials have expressed concern over Palantir’s capability to serve ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations because those operations also require an enormous amount of logistics planning. While Palantir has been useful for specific data sets, one former Homeland Security official argued it’s largely viewed as a “general purpose tool.”\n\n“It’s still only as good as the data,” said the former Homeland Security official, stressing that while a database may be able to help identify who’s undocumented in the US, it would also need to include information on where that individual is in the immigration process. Not all people who are in the US undocumented are immediately removable.\n\nThe description for the services ICE is seeking from Palantir includes “streamlined end to end immigration Lifecyle from identification to removal,” including deportation logistics, according to a document posted on the Federal Register.\n\nDetails of the master immigration database and Palantir’s role were first reported by Wired.\n\nIn an interview with Time Magazine published on Friday, Trump said DOGE was assembling a database with Americans’ personal information “because we want to find waste, fraud, and abuse, and want to cut our costs.” Asked if any of the data would be used to round up migrants for deportations, Trump said, “not that I know of, no.”\n\nWithin days of Trump taking office, DOGE allies started clashing with career IRS officials as they tried to access closely guarded taxpayer databases. Over the objections of top IRS officials, they pushed through a data-sharing deal with ICE earlier this month. One former IRS employee previously told CNN it felt like a “hostile takeover” of the tax-collection agency.\n\nThere has been no public indication that IRS data has yet begun to flow to DHS since the data-sharing deal was signed on April 7.\n\nA Treasury Department spokesperson in a statement to CNN denied that any taxpayer data was being used beyond the terms of the deal IRS signed with ICE.\n\n“Congress has been very clear about the limited exceptions in which taxpayer information can be shared,” the spokesperson said in a statement to CNN. “The implication that taxpayer information is being inappropriately shared across government agencies is not only incorrect but dangerous.”\n\nWhen DOGE staffers participated in a strategy session in Washington, DC, earlier this month, with the goal to streamline IRS technology, Palantir representatives were there too, according to the former senior IRS official with knowledge of the event.\n\nThe Treasury spokesperson described the event in statement to CNN as “a seminar of various strategy sessions” that included “long-time IRS engineers who have been identified as the most talented technical personnel,” with an overarching goal to “work diligently to create efficient systems” for the IRS.\n\nThe administration has made data-sharing across federal agencies an early priority. A March 20 executive order signed by Trump directs agency heads to remove “unnecessary barriers to Federal employees accessing Government data and promoting inter‑agency data sharing.”\n\nStill, some of DOGE’s data-collection efforts have drawn lawsuits from various employee unions, immigrant-rights groups, and others who argued that privacy laws were being violated. A court filing from one of those cases, filed by several unions, shows that DOGE representatives were accessing data across agencies with a focus on immigration status.\n\nIn mid-March, a DOGE staffer working out of the Social Security Administration requested and was granted access to the US Citizenship and Immigration Services’ SAVE database, according to a court filing in the case. The database allows federal, state and local governments to verify people’s immigration status.\n\nThe DOGE staffer wrote in an email to Social Security leaders that such access is “absolutely critical to get detailed immigration status for non-citizen (Social Security numbers)” in order to find fraud and improper payments.\n\nBut some Democrats are raising red flags about DOGE staffers “infiltrating multiple agencies at once,” and “recklessly and haphazardly combining data without any verification or validation,” as one senior House Oversight Committee Democratic staffer put it to CNN.\n\n“The Trump Administration’s troubling track record of mishandling sensitive data, including repeated breaches, improper disclosures, and politically driven data manipulation proves they cannot be trusted to consolidate vast stores of personal, financial, and biometric information into a centralized repository that can be more easily exploited for political ends,” the aide told CNN.\n\nIn a joint Fox News interview last month, Bessent and IRS-based DOGE staffer Sam Corcos, defended DOGE’s activities at the IRS, though most of their comments were focused on their efforts to improve the agency’s sluggish modernization efforts.\n\n“I really care a lot about this country,” Corcos said, adding that “we actually have quite a lot of software talent on the ground, the people writing code,” but they haven’t been “empowered” by past agency leadership to do their engineering work more effectively.\n\nBessent praised DOGE’s role in the Trump administration: “Sam and his crew are making it more efficient to work for the American people. So, what’s wrong with it working better, cheaper, faster and with more privacy?”\n\nA senior IRS official said career employees inside the agency are concerned about the Trump administration bringing in Palantir to exploit troves of taxpayer data as part of their push to speed up deportations.\n\nTrump appointees and DOGE allies who amassed substantial power within the IRS overcame a major hurdle toward creating their own master database when they pushed through a controversial data-sharing deal this month between the IRS and ICE.\n\nThe IRS-ICE arrangement was crafted, according to the Trump administration, to comply with strict privacy laws governing when taxpayer data can be shared across agencies. Among other “safeguards” mentioned in the document, DHS will only ask for information on undocumented immigrants suspected of defying an existing deportation order.\n\nStill, several career IRS executives raised alarms about the legality of the planned cooperation with ICE, and some even quit in protest.\n\nBut if the sharing of sensitive taxpayer data ultimately ends up happening, Palantir is a decent choice, the senior IRS official said, because “they are one of the more technologically apt companies.”\n\nA federal judge in DC is expected to rule in May on whether to block the IRS from sharing taxpayer data with ICE. Another federal judge in Maryland decided last week to extend restrictions on DOGE getting sweeping access to personal Social Security data.\n\n“The Privacy Act is not toothless. Defendants cannot flout the law,” US District Judge Ellen Hollander wrote. “They are not exempt from a statute that Congress enacted to protect American citizens from overbroad and unnecessary access to their (personally identifiable information.)”\n\nVirginia Rep. Gerry Connolly, the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, has touted whistleblowers that he claims have damning information about the DOGE plan.\n\nThese whistleblowers recently told Connolly’s office that DOGE is working to combine sensitive information from Social Security, IRS, HHS and other departments into a single, cross-agency database, he wrote last week in a letter to Social Security’s acting inspector general.\n\nThe Social Security Administration’s Office of the Inspector General is reviewing the letter, said Rebecca Rose, spokesperson for the office.\n\n“In an apparent attempt to sidestep network security controls, the Committee has learned that DOGE engineers have tried to create specialized computers for themselves that simultaneously give full access to networks and databases across different agencies,” Connolly wrote.\n\n“DOGE have assembled backpacks full of laptops, each with access to different agency systems, that DOGE staff is using to combine databases that are currently maintained separately,” Connolly continued, noting that such a database would “pose unprecedented operational security risks” by allowing a breach at one agency from spreading widely.\n\nConnolly said he’s “concerned that DOGE is moving personal information across agencies without the notification required under the Privacy Act or related laws, such that the American people are wholly unaware their data is being manipulated in this way.”\n\nTanya Broder, a top attorney at the National Immigration Law Center said she is worried that errors in the master database could harm everyone, not just potential deportees.\n\n“Even if the pretense is to target a small subset of people for removal, the effort will inevitably harm US citizens and people here legally,” she said. “All of us risk having privacy compromised. Citizens and immigrants live together – there’s no way to target a subset of undocumented people without harming citizens and lawful permanent residents.”\n\nThis story has been updated with additional reporting.', 'Zeroing in on the IRS', 'Updated 2:32 PM EDT, Fri April 25, 2025', 'doge-is-building-a-master-database-for-immigration-enforcement-sources-say-1745808373'),

He said Santos not only lied but it was the “extravagance along the way with his lies.”\n\nSeybert pointed out Santos was making money from social media appearances, a documentary and podcasts, and she found it “incredible” that he didn’t open up a savings account to pay back restitution and that he kept up with the lies and continued to blame the government.\n\nThe sentencing marks a downfall for the former New York Republican congressman who pleaded guilty in August. At the time, he was also ordered to pay restitution of $373,000 as part of an agreement.\n\nThe Justice Department sought a more than seven-year prison sentence for Santos, while he asked the court for the minimum sentence of two years.\n\nSantos, who represented parts of Long Island and Queens during his brief and scandal-plagued tenure in Congress, was expelled from the House in late 2023 after the House Ethics Committee released a report of additional “uncharged and unlawful conduct” by Santos.\n\nBeyond the report, he had sparked shock and controversy on Capitol Hill over revelations that he fabricated large parts of his life story and was also facing nearly two dozen federal charges, including allegations of fraud related to Covid-19 unemployment benefits, misusing campaign funds and lying about his personal finances on House disclosure reports.\n\nThe embattled former lawmaker survived previous attempts to remove him from office and originally pleaded not guilty to the charges in 2023.\n\nHe attempted to run in another New York district as an independent last year before ending his congressional bid after roughly a month and later pleaded guilty just weeks before the ex-congressman was set to stand trial on the federal charges.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details.', '', 'Updated 1:26 PM EDT, Fri April 25, 2025', 'former-rep-george-santos-sentenced-to-87-months-for-federal-fraud-charges-1745808373'),

Trump has given Musk the job of doing what so many conservatives have craved for so long: hacking the federal government to pieces.\n\nThe Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, was initially conceived as an effort under the command of both Musk and his fellow entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy. Trump said the group’s mission was “making changes to the Federal Bureaucracy with an eye on efficiency and, at the same time, making life better for all Americans.”\n\nIt’s an oddly bureaucratic description for the coming carnage. As the DOGE team goes to work, headlines emerge of Musk and a group of young, technology whizzes (including a 19-year-old who goes by the moniker “Big Balls”) roaming the halls of government, demanding access to files, prying into computer records, and rapidly pushing tens of thousands of federal workers to consider resigning or risk being fired.\n\nAt Yosemite National Park, employee Andria Townsend is terminated along with hundreds of other National Park employees in what they are calling the “Valentine’s Day Massacre.” She sees calamity lurking in the coming collision of understaffed facilities, decreased maintenance and the massive vacation crowds. “Moving forward, I think it’s just going to make life even harder and less efficient for the people working in the federal government right now, which seems to be the opposite of what the administration is trying to do.”\n\nAt the Department of Veterans Affairs, Latisha Thompson watches DOGE’s cuts with trepidation as reports trickle in from Trump supporters in the government who are shocked to find they too have been given pink slips.\n\n“This will have consequences in every community,” Thompson says. “Veterans will wait longer for the medical care that they need, Social Security claims will be delayed, food safety inspections will be cut back. We will have disaster response that will just be gutted.”\n\nDOGE makes foreign aid an early target. Sending tax dollars to help other people in other nations has never been particularly popular with American voters, even though it accounts for less than 1% of the federal budget.\n\nDead center in DOGE’s sights is the US Agency for International Development, with a long pedigree in providing education, health care, expertise, food and other services to struggling communities around the world. Many experienced political hands see it as a leading edge of America’s “soft power,” promoting goodwill and democratic ideals at bargain prices. “Development is a lot cheaper than sending soldiers,” former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates once famously said.\n\nBut DOGE paints USAID as a hotbed of corruption, with taxpayer funds going to contractors in sweetheart deals, given away or stolen. Musk, without evidence, calls it a “criminal organization.” Trump says it is “run by a bunch of radical lunatics.”\n\nAdministrators are put on forced leave. Workers are seen walking out with cardboard boxes of their belongings. Aid facilities around the world are shuttered overnight, leaving potentially lifesaving deliveries of food and medicine spoiling on distant docks. A global network of American influence built over 60 years is in shambles.\n\nA longtime aid worker who lost her job when the contractor she worked for was cut off does not want to be identified. But Jane, as we will call her, says her colleagues could barely comprehend the action. “I think they were heartbroken for the people in the countries that they were working in — seeing programs completely shut down on 24 hours’ notice. I don’t think Musk cared. I don’t think Trump cared.” Jane sighs and adds, “I think people were heartbroken being called criminals for the life’s work that they did.”\n\nThat despair might be not a bug, but a feature.\n\nRight before the fall election, a key contributor to Project 2025 spoke at an event hosted by the ultra-right-wing think tank Center for Renewing America, of which he was president. Russell Vought’s words, initially brought to light by ProPublica, offer an insight into how unmercifully some conservatives wanted to force federal workers into submission and retreat.\n\n“We want the bureaucrats to be traumatically affected,” Vought said in October. “When they wake up in the morning, we want them to not want to go to work, because they are increasingly viewed as the villains. We want their funding to be shut down.” Then, in case anyone missed the point in the giggling audience, he added, “We want to put them in trauma.”\n\nVought was director of the US Office of Management and Budget in Trump’s first term, and despite Democrats calling him Trump’s “most dangerous nominee,” Republicans have confirmed him to the job again.\n\nWhen Vought is called before the Senate Budget Committee just after resuming his work, Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia grills him about the “gleeful speech,” asking whether Vought honestly wants air traffic controllers, infant formula safety inspectors and drug enforcement officers traumatized. Vought repeatedly squirms and answers, “No.”\n\nThe coup de grace comes as Kaine notes Vought’s own mother was a civil servant — a schoolteacher — and recites even more of the budget boss’s own words back to him. “We want to take all these programs that help everyday people who are struggling and cut them because they are ‘woke and weaponized.’ Those are your words, not mine,” Kaine says.\n\nStill, when Vought leaves the hot seat, he goes right back to helping DOGE slash through the Internal Revenue Service; the National Institutes of Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; the CIA; the Social Security Administration; and Voice of America, which has provided news and free speech to beleaguered nations for generations. DOGE professes to have found tens of billions of dollars of “waste, fraud and abuse.” That is nowhere near the $2 trillion Musk initially said he’d save taxpayers, but, if accurate, it’s still a big ticket.\n\nHowever, when members of Congress and journalists press for details, many of the claims crumble. The DOGE website, billed as its “wall of receipts,” seems as flimsy as paper.\n\nAn ICE contract, canceled by DOGE and listed as $8 billion in savings, turns out to be for at most $8 million, a mistake The New York Times says should have been easily noticed since the lower number comes close to the entire annual budget for ICE. A vendor tells “PBS Newshour” that his company was listed as having a federal contract for nearly $10 million but it was for only $100,000 and the deal was never signed. Some contracts are listed multiple times on the website. Supposed savings posted by DOGE are repeatedly revised, exaggerated or removed when they prove inaccurate.\n\nDOGE’s chain saw approach leads to other embarrassments, too. Dozens of workers at the National Nuclear Security Administration are terminated in a wave of layoffs at the Energy Department. Then, when the administration realizes these are the people who oversee the nation’s nuclear weapons, they are quickly recalled. A free health care program for first responders to the 9/11 attacks is left reeling by on-again, off-again reports that its funding may be frozen.\n\nAt a CNN town hall, Democratic Rep. Jahana Hayes of Connecticut says she wants to hear about real waste, but many in her party believe Musk is leading a secretive, dangerous and deeply flawed process. “What we’re talking about is burning down the house instead of taking out the garbage,” she says.\n\nMusk and company push on, seeking (and in many cases reportedly getting) access to tax returns, Social Security numbers and other sensitive information belonging to millions of regular Americans. As a rule, anyone in the way is pushed aside, reassigned or fired. DOGE taps into computer systems the Treasury Department uses to make payments. Considering Musk was not elected to any role — he is a special government employee and, as such, not subject to the protocol or checks of a typical federal worker — some see this as akin to the friend of a bank teller getting access to all the customers’ accounts and credit card numbers.\n\n“Terrifying,” says Democratic strategist and CNN contributor Paul Begala. “You’re talking about literally trillions of dollars. The crown jewels of the federal government are the nuclear arsenal and the Treasury payment systems.”\n\nRamaswamy is nowhere to be seen, having left DOGE right after Trump was sworn in. Ramaswamy, now running for governor of Ohio, denies rumors that disagreements with Musk played a part in his departure, but he tells Fox News: “We had different — and complementary — approaches. I focused more on a constitutional law, legislative-based approach. He focused more on a technology approach.”\n\nUnder pressure over DOGE’s activity, Trump invites journalists into the Oval Office for a rambling session with Musk.\n\n“Some of the things that I say will be incorrect and should be corrected,” Musk says as his young son sits on his shoulders and lounges on his head. “Nobody’s going to bat a thousand … we will make mistakes, but we will act quickly to correct any mistakes.” Then he promptly repeats what is already a widely debunked claim about $50 million worth of condoms being sent to Gaza.\n\nTrump praises the unproven “billions and billions” in savings. Musk says, “The people voted for major government reform, and that’s what people are going to get.”\n\nBoth brush off the question so many watchdog groups have raised: How can Musk, whose companies have billions in government contracts, not have a conflict of interest in overseeing precisely that kind of spending?\n\nDebates break out on news shows and podcasts over whether Musk is becoming more of a liability to Trump than an asset, and whether he is approaching his own termination date.\n\nFormer Trump adviser Steve Bannon, who has raised alarms about Musk’s role, shares with Politico a reason the president might want to keep the owner of X close. “He (Musk) holds the two tactical nuclear weapons of modern politics, which is unlimited cash and a social media platform that’s not just ubiquitous, but also he can deem who’s heard and who’s not heard.”\n\nIt’s a keen observation, because as public alarm rises over Musk’s role, some critics are expressing themselves in dramatic ways. Across the country, attacks are reported on Tesla dealerships, charging stations and privately owned cars. At a Nevada Tesla repair business, police say an unidentified attacker shoots and sets fire to cars, and the word “RESIST” is spray-painted across the shop’s front door. Gunfire, arson and vandalism incidents pop up around the Tesla brand in Kansas, Oregon, Massachusetts, Florida, South Carolina, Colorado, Texas and Washington, DC.\n\nTeam Trump, which has purposely upended the lives, careers and personal finances of thousands of federal workers with seemingly not a moment of concern, rushes to help the beleaguered billionaire.\n\n“Those responsible will be pursued, caught, and brought to justice,” the FBI’s new director, Kash Patel, says while announcing a task force to “crack down on violent Tesla attacks.” When a 24-year-old Colorado man is accused in one case, US Attorney General Pam Bondi says she will prosecute him with eyes on a 20-year sentence.\n\n“When I looked at those showrooms burning and those cars … exploding all over the place,” Trump says from the Oval Office. “You didn’t have that on January 6 … these are terrorists.”\n\nTrump’s secretary of commerce, Howard Lutnick, urges people to buy Tesla stock, astonishing ethics analysts by using his public office to promote a private company over its rivals. Trump, for his part, converts the White House into a makeshift car lot. Posing with Musk and a line of new Teslas, Trump declares he’s going to buy one from his uber-wealthy friend.\n\n“I think he’s been treated very unfairly by a very small group of people,” Trump says, “and I just want people to know that he can’t be penalized for being a patriot.”\n\nNone of it has erased the steep tumble of Tesla’s stock value, which is mesmerizing Wall Street. Musk complains on X, “Tesla just makes electric cars and has done nothing to deserve these evil attacks.” Nevertheless, some Tesla owners start slapping stickers on the back of their cars saying things like “I bought this before Elon went crazy” and “Mars is ready Elon. Go. And take Trump with you.”\n\n“I have rarely if ever seen any change of perception as dramatic as this one,” says CNN’s chief data analyst, Harry Enten, as public approval ratings for the electric car impresario drive off a cliff.\n\nMany on the right remain delighted with the work of DOGE. For decades, these voters have chafed at the inability of Republican leaders to rein in what they are convinced is a lazy, corrupt, incompetent bureaucracy; a “deep state” that thwarts their political ambitions while taking their hard-earned dollars. Trump supports that sentiment, and insiders say he truly enjoys hanging out with Musk, whether at Mar-a-Lago, at a rocket launch, or while stirring up the MAGA base with speeches about a new age in which the government truly works for them.\n\nNonetheless, the broship’s philosophy of smashing everything first and figuring out if they went too far second is risky. It is unclear what the government will look like, or cost, or be able to do once the demolition is complete. It is equally uncertain how much it will take to restart some of these programs if Trump or a future president chooses to do so. And while many disruptions in service will likely not affect the super-rich, they may be life-altering for working Americans living paycheck to paycheck and relying on government programs.\n\nSome of those voters will soon start appearing online and in news stories to say they voted for the 47th president, but they did not vote for this.\n\nCNN’s Kaanita Iyer contributed to this report.', '', 'Published 6:00 AM EDT, Fri April 25, 2025', 'american-battleground-tearing-down-the-house-with-the-richest-man-in-the-world-1745808373'),

But going there immediately is going to be very painful,” former FEMA Administrator Craig Fugate, who served under the Obama administration, said of the proposed changes.\n\nWhen a state requests a major disaster declaration, FEMA uses a metric that measures the estimated cost of the assistance against the state population – known as the Per Capita Indicator (PCI) – to evaluate the severity of the damage and inform its recommendation to the president on whether to approve public assistance.\n\nHamilton’s proposal would increase the PCI from $1.89, its current level, to $7.56, which would focus federal funds on large-scale disasters and “eliminate small disaster declarations.”\n\nHamilton argues such a change would “reduce Federal costs by hundreds of millions annually” and better reflect inflation and current economic conditions, given these thresholds have hardly increased in recent decades.\n\nPrevious administrations have discussed raising the PCI, which was established in 1986 and set at $1. A 2011 government report called the indicator – at that point only $1.35 – “artificially low” because its modest growth didn’t properly reflect increases in personal income and inflation; with those factors taken into account, the report said the indicator would have been at $3.57 in 2011\n\nBut state emergency managers told CNN a threshold increase of the magnitude proposed by Hamilton would pose a huge challenge when future disasters hit.\n\n“That’s a massive increase,” said Karina Shagren, communications director for the Washington Military Department, which oversees the state’s emergency management. “We’re fully anticipating that states are going to have to take on a larger burden to respond to emergencies. We just need some clarity. We’re trying to develop a path forward without really knowing what the path looks like.”\n\nNorth Carolina Emergency Management spokesman Justin Graney told CNN the proposed increase was “alarming.”\n\nRural communities, especially in large states, could struggle most to fill the gaps. Those areas often suffer severe, but concentrated damage, and may not qualify for public assistance under a much higher threshold.\n\n“States are not prepared today,” said Michael Coen, former FEMA chief of staff under the Biden and Obama administrations. “If they were given notice, and they could work with their state legislatures, they could prepare and budget to be able to handle the risks that they know they have. But doing this without giving states any advanced notice would leave them in dire straits.”\n\nFederal disaster declarations have risen steadily in recent years, as extreme weather becomes increasingly destructive and costly in a warming world.\n\nCoen called the proposal to increase the PCI fourfold “unprecedented.”\n\n“It would adversely affect states that have a lot of risk and don’t have the financial capability to respond,” Coen said. “Americans that live in these communities are going to see a delay in their recovery.”\n\nIt is unclear whether the memo and the high threshold it proposes are tied to recent White House denials of major disaster declarations for some states, including Arkansas, Washington state and Kentucky.\n\nThe Trump administration recently denied Washington state’s request for FEMA public assistance after a deadly bomb cyclone last year. The state submitted $34 million in verified damages – more than twice FEMA’s current threshold to warrant federal assistance.\n\nWashington met “all” of the “very clear criteria” to qualify for disaster funding, Gov. Bob Ferguson, a Democrat, wrote in a statement after Trump’s denial, adding it was “another troubling example of the federal government withholding funding.”\n\nShagren said the federal government has not indicated to her state that it is planning to change the threshold for assistance. Washington state is planning to appeal the federal government’s denial of a major disaster declaration.\n\nBut it hasn’t just been blue states that have been shut out of assistance.\n\nAs CNN has reported, the Trump administration denied Arkansas GOP Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders’ request for individual and public assistance following an outbreak of severe storms and tornadoes that also affected neighboring Mississippi and Missouri and left more than 40 people dead.\n\nThe denial of the request, dated April 11, said the Trump administration had “determined that the damage from this event was not of such severity and magnitude as to be beyond the capabilities of the state, affected local governments, and voluntary agencies. Accordingly, we have determined that supplemental federal assistance is not necessary.”\n\nSanders, a longtime Trump ally and his former press secretary, is appealing the decision to the White House, saying in a statement “without the support of a Major Disaster Declaration, Arkansas will face significant challenges in assuming full responsibility and achieving an effective recovery from this event.”\n\nThe tornado ripped through rural Arkansas in March, leveling homes, churches and stores in a town called Cave City, leaving three people dead.\n\nCave City resident Irma Carrington, who runs a local business called Crystal River Cave Tours, said the town’s grocery store, pharmacy, dental office and multiple churches were badly damaged by the tornado. The town is still without its grocery store, and individuals who lost homes have been relying on home insurance or their personal savings to build back.\n\nCarrington told CNN she was frustrated at the lack of federal help for the area.\n\n“I would not be too happy with our government if they don’t step in and step up when we need it the worst,” Carrington said. “Our whole town has been affected. Our people pay taxes like everybody else. I don’t understand why we’re not getting it, I would think we’ve had plenty of damages.”\n\nThe memo also proposes the president keep the federal cost share for disaster recovery from exceeding 75% – meaning the federal government covers 75% of the recovery and the state and local governments pay the remaining 25% – which is standard for most disasters but is sometimes elevated after particularly devastating storms.\n\nUntil recently, North Carolina was awarded 100% federal cost share for recovery from Hurricane Helene. This month, Trump denied extensions for the state, bringing the federal cost share down to 90% moving forward.\n\nThe administration will also consider eliminating public assistance for recreational facilities (like parks and boat docks) and denying all major disaster declarations for snowstorms.\n\nDuring the Obama administration, the former FEMA officials said, the agency repeatedly raised the threshold for states to qualify for federal assistance after a snowstorm, given the burden the disasters placed on the federal government to fund large-scale snow removal. But no administration has outright barred states from receiving major disaster declarations from a snowstorm.\n\nTrump and his allies have criticized FEMA for months as ineffective and unnecessary. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, whose department oversees FEMA, has vowed to “eliminate” the agency.\n\nFugate, the former FEMA administrator, hopes the proposal sparks a bipartisan conversation about reforming the agency rather than dismantling it.\n\n“This would be pretty drastic, but maybe it will start a more meaningful discussion on the policy side,” Fugate said of the proposal. “What is the proper balance between you as a federal taxpayer subsidizing states that are building in high hazard coastal areas, that are profiting from that development, but you’re basically their insurance policy.”', 'Eliminating small disaster declarations', 'Published 5:00 AM EDT, Fri April 25, 2025', 'trump-officials-discuss-making-it-much-harder-to-qualify-for-federal-disaster-assistance-starting-this-hurricane-season-1745808374');

The move comes after a wave of concern and criticism about the threat to the longstanding study.\n\nFor decades, the initiative – conducted by the National Institutes of Health – has tracked the health of tens of thousands of women to understand how to reduce the risk of cancer, cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis and more in women after menopause.\n\nSeminal findings from the project have included the risks of using certain kinds of hormone therapy for menopause – helping prevent an estimated 126,000 breast cancer diagnoses – and the finding that vitamin D does not help prevent bone loss. The work has led to more than 2,400 scientific publications overall, shaping clinical practice and public health policies across multiple disciplines in the US.\n\nOn Monday, the program announced that HHS planned to terminate contracts with its regional centers in September, a move that would “significantly impact ongoing research and data collection.”\n\nInvestigators were awaiting more details Thursday when an update from HHS indicated that plans had changed.\n\n“These studies represent critical contributions to our better understanding of women’s health,” HHS told CNN in a statement. “While NIH initially exceeded its internal targets for contract reductions, we are now working to fully restore funding to these essential research efforts. NIH remains deeply committed to advancing public health through rigorous gold standard research and we are taking immediate steps to ensure the continuity of these studies.”\n\nIn a social media post Thursday, HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said that “we are not terminating this study.”\n\n“We all recognize that this project is mission critical for women’s health,” he wrote.\n\nExperts say that cuts to one of the largest long-term studies on women’s health would be a critical loss, jeopardizing invaluable datasets and important studies already in the works.\n\n“We already have serious gaps in women’s health that need to be addressed,” Dr. Stephanie Faubion, director of the Mayo Clinic’s Women’s Health Specialty Clinic in Jacksonville, Florida, and medical director for The Menopause Society, said when the funding cuts were announced.\n\nThe Trump administration has identified addressing chronic disease as one of its top priorities, and the Women’s Health Initiative has a unique ability to do that.\n\n“When you compare a person to themselves over time, it allows you to much more definitively answer questions about the causes or the factors that contribute to the development of those kinds of diseases that we’re all worried about, whether it’s heart disease, cancer, dementia, diabetes, fractures, things like that,” said Dr. Rebecca Thurston, a prominent women’s health researcher. “It’s the ability to follow a large number of people over time.”\n\nThe launch of the Women’s Health Initiative in 1992 marked a major shift in the way medical research regarded women, experts say.\n\n“For many years, we thought about women as essentially small men when it came to many chronic diseases,” Thurston said.\n\nThere had been a prevailing view that women’s health was only about “bikini medicine,” focused on reproduction and the areas of the body that a bikini covers, she said.\n\n“I think the Women’s Health Initiative, and subsequently other studies, have really underscored that things like cardiovascular disease, stroke, dementia and brain aging, they have unique features in women and unique contributors,” Thurston said. “That means that we really have to study women specifically, that they’re not interchangeable with men, and that women’s health is more than bikini medicine.”\n\nThe historical lack of inclusion of women in medical research is why funding for a project like the Women’s Health Initiative is so important, said Dr. Stella Dantas, president of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.\n\n“WHI centers have become a source of invaluable data and drive research on treatments to address some of the most common health concerns for postmenopausal women, such as heart disease and breast cancer,” she said in a statement.\n\nThurston says that some major findings from the Women’s Health Initiative were being published at a formative time in her career and led to the work she does now, researching menopause, cardiovascular disease and brain aging.\n\n“This study has been answering really important questions on really prevalent health issues,” she said. “We need to keep the science going. It’s so important if we want to prevent heart disease, prevent cancer, keep our bones healthy, keep our brains healthy.

In the quarter decade since measles was declared eliminated in the US, there has been only one other year with more cases.\n\nMore than half of US states have reported at least one case this year, but the vast majority have been linked with an outbreak centered on an area of West Texas with a large unvaccinated population. Three people – two children and one adult – have died, all of whom were unvaccinated.\n\nThe new model, published Thursday in the journal JAMA, looks at the potential spread of the disease in the US over 25 years based on different vaccination levels calculated using data from 2004-23.\n\nThe researchers – from Stanford, Baylor, Rice and Texas A&M universities – estimate current state-by-state vaccination coverage for measles at 87.7% to 95.6%.\n\nBecause measles is so contagious, experts say the only way to prevent outbreaks is if at least 95% of a community has received two doses of the MMR vaccine. After this rate was maintained for a decade, though, coverage dipped during the Covid-19 pandemic and has yet to recover. The measles vaccination rate fell to 92.7% for kindergartners in the 2023-24 school year, according to data from the CDC.\n\nAt current vaccination rates, the model predicts that the disease would become endemic in the US within 25 years.\n\nIf the vaccination rate declines 10%, the US would see 11.1 million cases of measles over this period.\n\nIf current trends were reversed and there was a 5% increase in the number of people getting the MMR vaccine, however, there would be only 5,800 measles cases over 25 years.\n\nThe model showed that other vaccine-preventable diseases shouldn’t become endemic in the US at current levels of vaccination. If, however, routine childhood vaccination falls 50%, it predicts 51.2 million measles cases over a 25-year period, 9.9 million cases of rubella, 4.3 million cases of poliomyelitis and 197 cases of diphtheria. With such a steep decline in vaccinations, these diseases would cause 10.3 million hospitalizations and 159,000 deaths.\n\n“These findings support the need to continue routine childhood vaccination at high coverage to prevent resurgence of vaccine-preventable infectious diseases in the US,” the researchers wrote.\n\nOne of the limitations of the study is that it doesn’t take into account that vaccination rates can fluctuate from community to community. Essentially, each state gets its own bucket, noted Dr. Mujeeb Basit, a modeling expert on disease spread who wasn’t involved with the new research.\n\n“But the problem with that is, you’re comparing Texas to a smaller state like Rhode Island. So it’s not a homogenous distribution by size, so the accuracy of the numbers will fluctuate,” said Basit, a professor at UT Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas.\n\nBut he said the issue is computationally difficult, and the researchers took a “really nice approach.”\n\nResearch like this is important, he said, because it shows clearly that if vaccination trends continue, the US could experience continuous measles outbreaks that would have a cascading effect on the health system.\n\n“Hopefully, it will get people to think,” he said – and to act, getting protection through vaccination.', '', 'Updated 2:18 PM EDT, Fri April 25, 2025', 'us-may-have-millions-more-measles-cases-over-next-25-years-if-childhood-vaccination-rates-continue-to-decline-study-says-1745808522'),

Their next trip will be to Niagara Falls.\n\n“We have a whole schedule,” Ribot said. “We’re choosing to live every single day with a lot of intention.”\n\nThat’s because they know that Rios’ window to easily create new memories is closing. About three years ago, at age 46, he was diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer’s disease.\n\nAlthough Rios has been doing well on a new treatment he receives through a clinical trial, Ribot is increasingly afraid that the study could be hindered by cuts to federal funding of biomedical research.\n\nThe Trump administration has been conducting a restructuring of the US Department of Health and Human Services as well as a review of funding, resulting in the abrupt cancellation of hundreds of research grants under the National Institutes of Health and many others left in limbo, waiting for a decision on whether their funding will be renewed.\n\nIn March, 14 of 35 Alzheimer’s Disease Research Centers had their funding halted by the NIH as the administration stopped $65 million in funding for research, according to Democratic lawmakers.\n\n“NIH paused funding for 14 research grants across several universities. It is important to note that this action was not a reflection of the quality or significance of the research, including the critical work being done in Alzheimer’s disease,” HHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon said in an email Thursday. “Instead, the pause was a necessary step in response to compliance issues related to grant proposals that included language pertaining to DEI, as well as concerns regarding antisemitism.”\n\nNixon said that the NIH is “committed to advancing groundbreaking research in Alzheimer’s disease. However, we also have a responsibility to ensure that all grant proposals align with the established policies, including ensuring that language used in these proposals reflects NIH’s commitment to non-discriminatory, merit-based research practices,” he said. “The responsibility for removing any non-compliant language lies with the institutions, and we encourage them to make necessary changes so these important Alzheimer’s studies will resume.”\n\nRibot called the funding pauses alarming.\n\n“This is alarming, because these are critical data that inform not only prognosis but inform trajectory of the disease and inform future treatments,” Ribot said.\n\nRios also has been following these developments and remains worried about his future.\n\n“He just asked me, ‘Am I going to continue getting the trial?’ But he was crying and literally ripping the skin off his fingers because of the anxiety,” Ribot said. “He knows what’s at stake. He is aware. He wants to continue the medication.”\n\nRios has been participating in a clinical trial conducted by Washington University in St. Louis in which he has been receiving the Alzheimer’s drug Leqembi paired with an experimental therapy called E2814, given as intravenous infusions, to help slow his Alzheimer’s symptoms.\n\nRibot credits the trial with helping curb Rios’ memory loss and cognitive decline.\n\nBefore Rios was diagnosed, he began to emotionally withdraw and disconnect from loved ones. He even got lost while driving to a routine doctor’s appointment about 10 minutes from their home, Ribot said.\n\nShe initially thought he was showing signs of depression. But Rios’ doctor realized that something else was happening in his brain and referred him to the Young-Onset Dementias Clinic at Johns Hopkins in Baltimore.\n\n“They ran more tests, and they ran the genetic testing, and that’s when we had the final confirmation that it was Alzheimer’s,” Ribot said.\n\nIf funding for Rios’ clinical trial is curtailed, she said, not only could he and the other participants lose access to the medications that they hope are giving them more time to live normally, the development of other impactful Alzheimer’s treatments could be delayed.\n\nAbout a dozen Alzheimer’s disease research centers are still waiting for their federal funding to be renewed, said Dr. Michael Greicius, professor of neurology and neurological sciences at the Stanford University School of Medicine, whose Alzheimer’s center is among those awaiting a decision.\n\n“Our five-year renewal was reviewed in October. Normally, we would have gotten a decision probably around February,” he said, adding that research funding for his team at the Stanford Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center ran out about three weeks ago.\n\n“It seems like we’re moving towards renewal, but it’s very hard to read the tea leaves, and that makes it really challenging when you’re thinking about projects you’d like to undertake or hiring new research coordinators, for example,” he said.\n\nGreicius and his colleagues had to hold off on starting research projects because they didn’t know whether there will be funding coming in, he said.\n\nThe uncertainty around funding baffles him.\n\n“It’s hard to imagine a less political topic than Alzheimer’s disease. I mean, it affects people from red states and blue states and purple states. It’s so common. Almost everyone either has a relative in their family or at least has a friend who has a relative that’s been affected by Alzheimer’s disease,” Greicius said.\n\n“It still seems like the easiest-to-agree-upon target for federally funded research, and yet it’s not at all clear that this progress is going to continue,” he said. “That, for me, is a large part of the frustration – just the uncertainty of it all.”\n\nPreventive neurologist Dr. Richard Isaacson, founder of one of the first Alzheimer’s prevention clinics in the United States, is also waiting to see whether his federal grants will be renewed.\n\n“We’re somewhere between limbo and purgatory,” he said.\n\nIsaacson, who directs research at the Institute for Neurodegenerative Diseases in Florida, has developed free online software called RetainYourBrain, which aims to democratize access to brain health care. Users input their risk factors for Alzheimer’s and receive a personalized risk assessment, as well as personalized recommendations and time-sensitive reminders on how to improve their brain health.\n\nBut without continued funding, “it may never be released to the public,” Isaacson said.\n\nSupporters of the funding cuts argue that the nation should reduce “wasteful spending” and prioritize efficiency.\n\n“With the government wanting to cut back on spending money, I get it. But Alzheimer’s is one of the most expensive diseases to our health care system,” Isaacson said.\n\nIt’s estimated that nearly 1 in every 6 Medicare dollars was spent on someone with the disease last year, according to the Alzheimer’s Association, and the average per-person Medicare spending for older adults with Alzheimer’s is estimated to be 2.8 times higher than average per-person spending for all other seniors.\n\n“I feel that cutting Alzheimer’s research that may save money over time, and doing it rapidly, is a bad investment,” Isaacson said.\n\nWhile some studies are waiting to see if they’ll continue, some studies have already had to take steps to shut down.\n\nWhen the NIH canceled grants in March related to diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, some Alzheimer’s studies were swept up in the consequences.\n\nFederal funding for a multiyear study at the University of California, Davis’ Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center was abruptly terminated. This led the center’s co-director, Dr. Charles DeCarli, to issue an appeal and fight to have the grant fully reinstated.\n\n“The appeal had to be done within 30 days, and in the meantime, we had to shut down the study. So while I was working on the appeal, my team was doing all the things that closing a study needs to involve, which is hundreds of hours of work, notifying the 33 sites in this study,” he said.\n\nDeCarli’s appeal was successful. He won that battle but is still recovering from the turmoil.\n\n“It was a very challenging month in my life,” DeCarli said. “It just seems to me that the only reason that this was terminated is because it includes the word ‘diverse’ in the title.”\n\nThe study, titled “The Clinical Significance of Incidental White Matter Lesions on MRI Amongst a Diverse Population with Cognitive Complaints (INDEED),” involves examining the effect that white matter injury in the brain and vascular issues may have on cognitive performance as well as health outcomes. The research was being funded by the NIH’s National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke.\n\nUp to 25% of people who develop dementia later in life may have some type of vascular contributing factor to their disease, and DeCarli said his study could help “lay out the foundation” for diagnostic tests and treatments for them.\n\n“When these studies are terminated, an opportunity is lost to advance science,” he said.\n\nOther studies may face similar threats to funding. According to a policy notice issued Monday, the NIH said it will begin pulling medical research funding from universities with diversity and inclusion programs and any boycotts of Israeli companies.\n\nThe agency “reserves the right to terminate financial assistance awards and recover all funds” if grant recipients do not comply with federal guidelines barring diversity and equity research and “prohibited boycotts,” the notice said.\n\nThe policy applies to “domestic recipients of new, renewal, supplement, or continuation awards that are issued on or after” April 21, according to the notice.\n\nSeparately, the Washington-based nonprofit UsAgainstAlzheimer’s has been tracking previously terminated grants and the funding cuts at the NIH that took place in March and earlier this month, and it warns that some cuts could stall the progress being made to find a cure for Alzheimer’s disease.\n\n“In the last 10 years, there have been groundbreaking advances in Alzheimer’s disease research, in understanding where the disease comes from, and understanding how to diagnose the disease, and ultimately in how to treat the disease. But we don’t have a cure yet,” said Russ Paulsen, chief operating officer at UsAgainstAlzheimer’s.\n\n“In looking through the list of grants that have been affected, it appears to cut across prevention, diagnosis, treatment and ultimately seeking a cure, as well as understanding the basics of the disease to start with,” he said. “We’ve made huge progress, and now is not the time to take our foot off the accelerator.”\n\nIn the meantime, Ribot and Rios are trying to keep their heads up. They are keeping an eye on any new developments in research funding cuts while continuing to focus on their travel bucket list.\n\n“While he’s here and we’re here, we’re living our life. We are finding joy. Even when we cry, we laugh. Even when we are in despair, we have hope,” Ribot said.\n\n“I’m not going to romanticize this disease, because that’s not it – but there’s still purpose and meaning and joy,” she said. “We’re not going to let this disease rob us of our present.”', 'An experimental treatment', 'Updated 3:30 PM EDT, Thu April 24, 2025', 'uncertainty-around-nih-funding-leaves-alzheimers-studies-in-limbo-1745808522'),

The fertility rate last year – 54.6 births for every 1,000 women of reproductive age – increased less than 1% from the record low in 2023, hovering well below rates from years earlier.\n\nThe US fertility rate has been trending down for decades, with a particularly steep dip after the Great Recession of 2008. An uptick in 2021 spurred theories about a Covid-19 “baby bump,” but the rate quickly returned to its more consistent downward pattern.\n\nExperts say that year-to-year movement in the fertility rate tends to be incremental and that a single year of change – such as this year’s slight increase – does not indicate a shift in the long-term trend.\n\nBut the latest provisional data, published Wednesday by the CDC’s National Center for Health Statistics, also shows that births continue to shift to older mothers. The fertility rate was highest among women in their early 30s in 2024, with more than 95 births for every 1,000 women ages 30 to 34.\n\nMeanwhile, teen births and births among women in their early 20s declined to record lows last year, the report shows. There were less than 13 births for every 1,000 teen girls, a 3% drop from 2023. And the birth rate for women ages 20 to 24 – about 56 births for every 1,000 women – was just slightly above the rate for women in their late 30s.\n\nThe small increase in births last year – about 27,000 more than in 2023 – was driven by higher birth rates among Asian and Hispanic women, while rates decreased among Black, White and American Indian women.\n\nExperts say there are many reasons why women may be waiting to have kids or not having them all, with decisions shaped by socioeconomic circumstances and people’s broader experiences with reproductive health.\n\nThe US is facing a maternal health care crisis, with more than a third of the country in a maternal health care desert and a strikingly high rate of maternal death, especially among Black women. Research also suggests that abortion bans in the US are exacerbating existing health disparities as births increase in high-risk populations and infant mortality rises disproportionately.\n\nComing amid the fertility slump is a rise in pronatalist rhetoric by some officials surrounding President Trump, but those pushing for a higher birth rate in the US have not laid out a clear plan for how to support women, babies and families.\n\nElon Musk, who leads the Department of Government Efficiency, has said the low birth rate keeps him up at night.\n\n“Humanity is dying,” he told Fox News last month.\n\nVice President JD Vance supported anti-abortion activists at a March for Life rally in January, days after being sworn in, and made his goal clear.\n\n“Our society has failed to recognize the obligation that one generation has to another as a core part of living in a society,” he said. “So let me say very simply, I want more babies in the United States of America.”\n\nAnd Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy sent a memo in March promising more funding to places with higher birth rates.\n\nIn 2023, Trump said he wanted “a baby boom” in the US. During the 2024 presidential campaign, he called himself the “father of IVF,” and he signed an executive order in February to develop policy recommendations to expand access to and affordability of in vitro fertilization.\n\nBut federal programs focused on reproductive health have taken a heavy hit as Musk’s department leads sweeping changes in the federal government.\n\nTwo-thirds of the CDC’s Division of Reproductive Health has been cut, according to a source who was part of the division and requested anonymity because of fear of retaliation. Programs focused on abortion surveillance, contraception guidelines, IVF surveillance, pregnancy risk assessment and more were among those that lost entire teams, with no plans to maintain them.\n\nThe US Department of Health and Human Services said Tuesday that maternal and reproductive health programs will continue under the new Administration for a Healthy America but offered no further details.\n\nCNN’s Catherine Shoichet contributed to this report.', '', 'Published 12:01 AM EDT, Wed April 23, 2025', 'us-fertility-rate-hovers-near-record-low-as-trump-administration-pushes-for-a-baby-boom-1745808522'),

Companies use the dyes to give food and drinks brighter colors and make them more appealing.\n\nMakary emphasized that this effort to eliminate dyes will be done by working with, rather than against, the industry.\n\n“There are a number of tools at our disposal. And so I believe in love, and let’s start in a friendly way and see if we can do this without any statutory or regulatory changes, but we are exploring every tool in the toolbox to make sure this gets done very quickly,” he said. “They want to do it. So why go down a complicated road with Congress when they want to do this? They don’t want to deal with a patchwork of 30 different state plans.”\n\nThe Consumer Brands Association, a trade association for the makers of consumer packaged goods, said that ingredients in the US food supply have been “rigorously studied following an objective science and risk-based evaluation process and have been demonstrated to be safe.”\n\n“As we increase the use of alternative ingredients, food and beverage companies will not sacrifice science or the safety of our products,” Melissa Hockstad, the group’s president and CEO, said in a statement.\n\nWhich dyes carry risk to human health and at what level is unclear. Historically, research on food dyes has been underfunded, and the FDA hasn’t thoroughly reviewed food dyes for decades experts say. Some studies show that dyes can pass through the human body quickly, but others show that they may accumulate over time.\n\nFor decades, research in animals has shown a potential link between artificial food dyes like red No. 3, red No. 40, blue No. 2 and green No. 3 and an increased risk of cancer or tumors. Other research shows that red No. 40 and yellow No. 5 and No. 6 contain or may be contaminated with known carcinogens.\n\nBlue No. 1 and yellow No. 6 may be toxic to some human cells, and as little as 1 milligram of yellow No. 5 may cause irritability, restlessness and sleep disturbances for sensitive children. Some research has also shown connections between artificial food dyes and restlessness, trouble learning and attention problems in some children who are sensitive to some dyes.\n\nIn January, under the Biden administration, the FDA announced that it had banned the use of red dye No. 3 in ingested drugs, food and beverages.\n\nOn Tuesday, Makary said the agency is requesting that food companies move up the deadline on that ban from the previous 2027-28 deadline. He also said it is establishing a national standard and timeline for the food industry to transition from petroleum-based food dyes to natural alternatives.\n\nThe FDA said it is initiating a process to revoke the authorization of synthetic food colorings, including those not in production – specifically citrus red No. 2 and orange B – within the coming weeks.\n\nThe FDA is also taking steps to work with industry to eliminate six synthetic dyes – red No. 40, yellow No. 5, yellow No. 6, blue No. 1, blue No. 2 and green No. 3 – by the end of next year.\n\n“The FDA is effectively removing all petroleum-based food dyes from the US food supply,” Makary said. “Today’s announcement fulfills the administration’s promise to use both gold standard science and common sense. For the last 50 years, we have been running one of the largest uncontrolled scientific experiments in the world on our nation’s children without their consent, and today we are removing these petroleum-based chemicals from their food supply.”\n\nThe FDA also said it will authorize four new natural color additives in the coming weeks and fast-track the review of natural alternatives to synthetic food dyes such as calcium phosphate, Galdieria extract blue, gardenia blue and butterfly pea flower extract.\n\nThe National Confectioners Association said it “looks forward to working with the Trump Administration and Congress on the issue.”\n\n“FDA and regulatory bodies around the world have deemed our products and ingredients safe,” Christopher Gindlesperger, senior vice president for public affairs and communications, said in a statement. “We follow and will continue to follow regulatory guidance from the authorities in this space, because consumer safety is our chief responsibility and priority.”\n\nConsumer Reports, a consumer safety group, said the goal is “laudable” but will take “years to achieve” since it’s relying on the goodwill of the food industry.\n\n“It’s encouraging to see the FDA working towards a ban on synthetic food dyes, but this multistep plan relies on voluntary industry efforts that will simply prolong the amount of time it will take to get dangerous dyes out of our food,” said Brian Ronholm, the group’s director of food policy.\n\nThe agency says it will offer some regulatory flexibility to the industry and will partner with the National Institutes of Health to do more research on food additives to determine their effects on children’s health.\n\nMore than half of states have legislation in the works or rules in place to restrict food dyes due to a concerns about human health, according to the Environmental Working Group, a nonprofit that advocates for environmental and health policy. The industry has been advocating for a more consistent federal standard, but some consumer groups have been encouraging states to continue creating local bans.\n\n“Consumer Brands has long asked HHS and FDA to reestablish themselves as the country’s leading regulatory authority and we appreciate that the administration has reasserted their leadership in response to the myriad of state activity in the food regulation space,” Hockstad said.\n\nEWG says it has been asking the federal government to take action on the issue for years.\n\n“The Food and Drug Administration has known for decades that synthetic food dyes are linked to health problems, particularly in children, but has failed to act,” Melanie Benesh, the group’s vice president for government affairs, said in an email. “We’re pleased the administration is following the lead of states like California and West Virginia by finally announcing their intent to ban dyes.”\n\nCalifornia has long been an outlier in its actions on food dyes and other additives, and in March, West Virginia Gov. Patrick Morrisey signed one of the most sweeping dye ban bills in the country.\n\nUS Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said Tuesday that removing these synthetic dyes from the food supply is a “no-brainer.”\n\n“Nobody wants to eat petroleum,” he said.\n\nKennedy praised food companies for working with the Trump administration to remove the dyes. “If they want want to eat petroleum, they ought to add it themselves at home,” he said he’d told his staff. “They shouldn’t be feeding it to the rest of us.”\n\nCNN’s Kristen Rogers and Deidre McPhillips contributed to this report.\n\nCorrection: A previous version of this report misstated when the six synthetic dyes will be phased out.', '', 'Updated 7:04 PM EDT, Tue April 22, 2025', 'fda-says-it-will-phase-out-petroleumbased-food-dyes-authorize-four-natural-color-additives-1745808522'),

It can come in the form of dirt, dust or smoke. Coal- and natural gas-fired power plants create it, as do cars, agriculture, unpaved roads, construction sites and wildfires.\n\nParticle pollution threatens human health because it is so tiny – a fraction of the width of a human hair – and can travel past the body’s usual defenses. When a person breathes these particles in, they can get stuck in the lungs and move into the bloodstream, causing irritation and inflammation.\n\nExposure to particle pollution is considered a significant factor in premature death around the world, according to the World Health Organization. Exposure can also raise the risk of conditions including certain cancers, stroke, asthma, preterm births, dementia, depression and anxiety.\n\nThe new report says that 85 million people in the US live in an area with a failing grade for year-round particle pollution, the second-highest number of people with such exposure since the report was first published in 2000.\n\nThe top 10 areas most polluted by year-round particle pollution are:\n\nEven in the short term, exposure to particle pollution can cause breathing problems or trigger a heart attack.\n\nDuring the research period, the report says, short-term particle pollution in the US was the highest level it has been in 16 years, with 77.2 million people living in counties with these unhealthy spikes.\n\nThe 10 areas most polluted by short-term particle pollution are:\n\nOzone pollution, also called smog, is the presence of ground-level ozone that forms when chemicals like nitrogen oxides and volatile organics from electric utilities, car exhaust, gasoline vapors, industrial facilities and chemical solvents react to sunlight.\n\nExposure to ozone pollution can cause asthma attacks and chest pain in the short term. Long-term exposure can also cause decreased lung function and premature death.\n\nThe top 10 areas most polluted by ozone are:\n\nThe American Lung Association report notes that people of color are the group most likely to live in neighborhoods with unhealthy air and are more than twice as likely as White people to live a community with a failing grade for two types of particle pollution or ozone pollution.\n\nPeople who identify as Hispanic are three times more likely as White people to live in an area with three failing grades for air pollution.\n\nDr. Juanita Mora, a pulmonologist who works in a predominantly Hispanic neighborhood on Chicago’s South Side, said she sees the toll of high air pollution levels nearly every day.\n\nThe demolition of a power plant in the area in 2020 spread soot “for miles and miles,” she said. When that combined with normal pollution levels, street vendors, other outdoor workers and a 7-year-old boy all came in wheezing and coughing.\n\n“He was just outside playing in his yard,” said Mora, who is also a volunteer spokesperson for the American Lung Association. “His parents had to rush him to the ER because he said he was having chest tightness and couldn’t stop coughing.\n\n“As a doctor, I feel like we’re failing millions and millions of kids and adults,” she added.\n\nIt doesn’t always take a demolished building for air pollution to cause widespread breathing problems.\n\nKatherine Pruitt, national senior director for policy at the American Lung Association and a co-author of the new report, said that a record number of warm days and wildfires during the research period caused “horrible ozone years.”\n\nPeople didn’t even have to live close to a wildfire to be affected, Pruitt said. Smoke plumes travel, and when they combine with typical pollution in urban areas, “they bump up the ability to produce ozone-forming compounds,” Pruitt said.\n\nIn 2023, Canadian wildfires caused problems for Mora’s patients hundreds of miles away in Chicago. “I saw so many kids and adults with asthma exacerbations around that time,” she said.\n\nDr. Panagis Gallatsatos, a pulmonary and critical care medicine specialist at Johns Hopkins Medicine, said doctors do what they can to help patients breathe better, “but we can only do so much against the air that they breathe.”\n\nGallatsatos, who is also a volunteer spokesperson for the Lung Association, said it’s been “rather defeating” to read about how many more Americans have been exposed to pollution.\n\n“As a lung doctor, I don’t have any medication that can really offset that,” he said. “For pollution, we rely on good policies and legislation to protect lung health.”\n\nAnd protective legislation may become harder to find. As part of the “biggest deregulatory action in US history,” the EPA said last month that it will revisit the Biden-era National Ambient Air Quality Standards for Particulate Matter, which govern how much soot can be released into the air.\n\nThe Trump administration is also considering looser regulations on power plants, the oil and gas industry, coal plants and other industries and machines that generate air pollution.\n\n“Obviously, we’re worried about what the future portends for all the hard work that we’ve done to put rules and practices into place to control emissions, both for particle pollution and ozone and for greenhouse gases that are affecting the climate,” Pruitt said. “It’s very worrisome.”\n\nIf EPA deregulation efforts are successful, Mora said, it will directly hurt her patients who are already breathing polluted air.\n\n“I believe I’m going to be seeing a lot more kids, more families affected by the lack of limits on particle pollution as well as ozone pollution, especially here in the city of Chicago,” she said. “If you can’t breathe, nothing else matters.”', '', 'Published 12:01 AM EDT, Wed April 23, 2025', 'nearly-half-of-americans-live-in-an-area-with-a-failing-grade-for-air-pollution-and-the-problem-is-only-getting-worse-1745808522'),

Kennedy Jr. consolidate many functions of the US Department of Health and Human Services into the Administration for a Healthy America, or AHA.\n\nIf the leaked budget draft is enacted, the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline’s LGBTQ+ youth specialized services could be defunded beginning in October, according to the nonprofit The Trevor Project, a suicide prevention organization for LGBTQ+ youth that has been a subcontractor to the specialized service since 2022, serving as one of seven call centers within the subnetwork that provides specialized services for LGBTQ+ youth.\n\nThe White House Office of Management and Budget did not respond to CNN’s request for comment.\n\nIn October 2020, Trump signed a bipartisan bill making 988 the universal telephone number to reach the national suicide prevention hotline.\n\nIn July 2022, the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline launched under the Biden administration, transitioning what was a 10-digit number to an easier-to-remember three-digit number. People seeking emotional and mental health support can dial 988 for help in the same way they might dial 911 for medical emergencies.\n\nSoon after its launch, the 988 Lifeline included a subnetwork for LGBTQ+ individuals to connect with specialized services. Now, when people dial 988, they are given the option to press 3 to reach crisis counselors trained to work with LGBTQ+ youth.\n\nThere have been some discussions within the Trump administration around ending the 988 Lifeline’s LGBTQ+ subnetwork, according to a person in HHS who has worked closely with the 988 Lifeline team and who asked for anonymity because they were recently given a Reduction in Force notice but hope to keep their job.\n\n“From what I gathered, and just talking to others, these decisions are made without input from anyone involved with the 988 team or project,” the source said, adding that if leadership on the 988 team was consulted, they probably would recommend against removing the LGBTQ+ subnetwork.\n\n“Suicide rates are four times higher among LGBTQ youth than others,” the person said. “There is data to show that rates of suicide among the LGBTQ community are higher, which is why there is a dedicated number to press if you are from that community, because there is such a critical need.”\n\nAs of mid-March, more than 14.5 million people have called, texted or sent chats to the 988 Lifeline and been transferred to a crisis contact center since July 2022, according to data from the US Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. About 1.2 million of those were routed to the LGBTQ+ specialized service.\n\n“Suicide prevention is about risk, not identity. Ending the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline’s LGBTQ+ youth specialized services will not just strip away access from millions of LGBTQ+ kids and teens – it will put their lives at risk,” Jaymes Black, CEO of The Trevor Project, said in a news release.\n\n“These programs were implemented to address a proven, unprecedented, and ongoing mental health crisis among our nation’s young people with strong bipartisan support in Congress and signed into law by President Trump himself,” he said. “We urge the Administration to maintain its long-standing commitment to ending suicide among high-risk populations, especially our nation’s young people.”\n\nMiriam Delphin-Rittmon, who served as HHS’s assistant secretary for mental health and substance use in the Biden administration, said she worries about how the agency’s restructuring may affect 988 as a public health resource as well as other services and programs that fall under the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration.\n\n“There’s been some discussion and questions about whether the LGBTQ+ line will remain, and so I am concerned about that part of 988,” she said. She’s also concerned about the 988 Veterans sub-lifeline, which is accessed by dialing 988 and pressing 1, and the Spanish subnetwork, which is accessed by dialing 988 and pressing 2.\n\nSince 2022, the federal government has invested some $1.5 billion in the 988 project, including expanding access to services for Spanish speakers, LGBTQI+ youth and young adults, and people who are deaf or hard of hearing by creating sub-lifelines or subnetworks for those groups.\n\nDelphin-Rittmon said she worries about how certain staffing and funding support for 988 could shift or be eliminated under the HHS restructuring.\n\nThe leaked memo notes that the budget would maintain the $10 million for specialized services for Spanish speakers seeking access to 988 services and eliminate the set-aside for specialized services for LGBTQ+ youth.\n\nAccording to the document, the budget does not include funding for the LGB Center of Excellence, the African American Behavioral Health Center of Excellence, the Asian American, Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander Behavioral Health Center of Excellence, the Hispanic/Latino Behavioral Health Center of Excellence and the LGBTQ Youth Family Support Program.\n\n“I’m concerned about SAMHSA overall,” Delphin-Rittmon said. “Certainly, there have been a lot of questions.”', '', 'Published 7:30 AM EDT, Fri April 25, 2025', '988-suicide-prevention-service-for-lgbtq-youth-would-be-eliminated-under-leaked-budget-proposal-1745808522');

And I feel like I probably was the same, too.”\n\nAt one point, Carly asked him to move out of their Tampa, Florida, home.\n\n“He was like, ‘No, we’ll figure it out under our own roof,’” she said.\n\nHe moved his things into a guest bedroom in the family home and began sleeping there.\n\nAfter a year in separate bedrooms, the couple decided to end their marriage. But leading up to that point, they continued living together in the same home, raising their daughter and appearing like a couple to the outside world.\n\n“He became a stranger to me that I was still married to under the same roof in a year’s time, and then we got divorced,” she said.\n\nAlthough the legal proceedings came later, the couple were already going through what’s often called a “silent divorce.”\n\nCouples end up in this situation when they no longer feel an attachment to each other but continue staying together for financial or other reasons, according to Stephanie Moir, a licensed mental health counselor and certified rehabilitation counselor with Serene Mind Counseling + Evaluations, a private mental health practice in Tampa and Jacksonville, Florida.\n\n“A silent divorce is when you’re not legally separated, but you’re definitely emotionally, mentally and almost to a certain point physically removed, too, from your spouse,” Moir said.\n\n“It’s really something that you’re going through personally and kind of on your own — it’s not really something that’s on paper or completely shared. So it can be isolating,” she added.\n\nIt’s a common refrain that marriage takes work. “If you don’t really work on a marriage, it could really lead to that emotional disconnect where two people are just not on the same page anymore,” Moir said.\n\nRealizing you no longer have common goals as a couple and an inability to see yourself “growing and expanding” with your partner is one sign you may be in or headed toward a silent divorce, she said.\n\n“Maybe you start taking separate vacations or don’t go together to social gatherings, like birthdays,” Moir said.\n\nAnother telling sign is a sustained lack of physical intimacy with your partner, whether you’re no longer having a sexual relationship or lacking any other kind of touch with each other that was formerly the norm, she added.\n\nLisa Lavelle, a licensed clinical social worker, psychotherapist and couples therapist in New York City, said she sees many “high-functioning couples” in her practice who are in silent divorces.\n\n“They may present like things are OK on the outside, and they’re great co-parents, and they work out logistics,” Lavelle said, but there’s an emotional disconnect.\n\n“One of the first red flags that I tend to see when couples are on the verge of or in a silent divorce is when they feel more like roommates than romantic partners. The focus is on being Mom and Dad and not husband and wife or partners,” Lavelle said.\n\nWhile all couples may feel disconnected from each other at some point, she said, things become problematic when they avoid talking about these issues and can’t bounce back.\n\nA lack of physical intimacy is an obvious sign of trouble, Lavelle said. But it’s important not to confuse a silent divorce with a “sleep divorce,” which is when couples choose to sleep separately because one snores or there’s another medical or comfort issue.\n\n“If you’re dealing with those types of issues with snoring or sleep apnea, it can actually help preserve your relationship (to sleep in separate rooms),” she said.\n\nA silent divorce can feel like a reprieve of sorts, Lavelle said, since a couple who may have been used to fighting before suddenly isn’t anymore.\n\nBut arguments in a relationship serve a purpose, said Justin Ho, a licensed professional counselor with Summit’s Edge Counseling in Marietta, Georgia.\n\n“As dysfunctional as it might seem, fighting often reflects we’re disagreeing at the moment, we’re not on the same page, we’re not seeing eye to eye — but we’re trying to help our partners see where we’re coming from,” he said.\n\nFor some couples, fighting can indicate there’s still a desire to feel connected. A couple in a silent divorce may not fight anymore because they don’t care, Lavelle said.\n\n“This is a couple who will talk about logistics, (like) what’s for dinner. But anything that is meaningful or uncomfortable, they don’t talk about it anymore,” she said. “There’s a lack of vulnerability.”\n\nThere’s also an emotional toll. “When you are married to someone and you are intentionally trying to avoid them, it takes time and energy to do that,” she said.\n\nCouples in a silent divorce experience an emotional separation that can lead to feelings of isolation, loneliness and resentment, Ho said.\n\n“Over time, those feelings really build up and are really difficult emotions to experience and to handle,” he added. “Oftentimes what we see is that it develops into, potentially, depression or anxiety. It manifests in a lot of different ways.”\n\nFor couples with children who are witnessing what’s going on, there’s collateral damage to consider.\n\n“(If) you’re around a couple that’s not getting along, it’s palpable,” Lavelle said. “You can feel like you’re walking on eggshells just witnessing how unhappy they are.”\n\nA silent divorce can lead to unmet needs not only for the adults involved but also for the children, Ho said.\n\n“Children might feel like they have to take sides or maybe even feel neglected in the relationship because they don’t have that united parental image to kind of look to or to lean on,” he said.\n\nCouples should also consider the financial implications of staying in a silent divorce instead of making it official.\n\nLiesl Savage, a financial adviser with Ameriprise Financial Services in Jacksonville, said she wouldn’t feel comfortable with her clients staying in a silent divorce for an extended period because of the financial liability that goes along with that.\n\n“If my soon-to-be ex gets in a car accident and someone dies in that accident, I’m going to have a whole disaster on my hands,” she said.\n\n“If you’re still married, you are on the hook with that person financially. You are intertwined.”\n\nIf you’re realizing you might be in a silent divorce, Ho said, you could sit down and talk with your partner.\n\n“Ask them, ‘Are you noticing the same thing as well?’ And really just try to get aligned at that moment,” Ho said.\n\nSuch a conversation, while uncomfortable, is an opportunity to see if the relationship is something you want to work on. Not talking has its own repercussions.\n\n“Resentments around parenting, resentments around finances, resentments around in-law, issues — when these topics get swept under the rug and not talked about, usually at least one party starts to feel resentful of the other person, and they don’t want to try as much,” Lavelle said.\n\nThe longer resentment goes unchecked, the harder it is to address, she added. That’s why it can be helpful to reach out for therapeutic support.\n\n“I think people make an assumption that therapy is about saving your relationship, and it can be,” Lavelle said. “But primarily, therapy is about helping couples have unspoken or uncomfortable conversations so they can make a more informed decision about their relationship.”\n\nTerry Ward is a Florida-based travel writer and freelance journalist in Tampa who never said marriage was easy.', 'What is a silent divorce?', 'Published 10:00 AM EDT, Sat April 26, 2025', 'signs-youre-in-a-silent-divorce-are-loud-and-clear-1745808522'),

CNN is monitoring these cases and updating this page each week as new national data is collected and released from state health departments by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nA large outbreak in West Texas is largely responsible for the spike in the national cases so far in 2025.\n\nMeasles is a highly contagious airborne disease. It can cause serious health consequences or death, especially for young and unvaccinated children. Most of the cases involve people younger than age 20.\n\nGeneral symptoms may include fever, cough, runny nose, watery eyes and a rash of red spots. About 1 in 5 unvaccinated people in the US who get measles will be hospitalized, according to the CDC.\n\nAbout 1 in every 20 children will develop pneumonia, and others may develop a dangerous swelling in the brain called encephalitis. Up to 3 of every 1,000 children who become infected with measles may die from respiratory and neurologic complications.\n\nNational data compiled by the CDC lags behind reports collected by state health agencies. Here’s the latest national snapshot of which states have reported cases so far.\n\nMeasles is preventable, thanks to a highly effective vaccine. Experts recommend that children get the measles, mumps and rubella, or MMR, vaccine in two doses: the first between 12 months and 15 months of age, and a second between 4 and 6 years old. One dose is about 93% effective at preventing measles infection; two doses are about 97% effective.\n\nThe current outbreak “is absolutely being driven and started by unvaccinated individuals,” said Dr. Michael Mina, chief scientific officer of the telehealth company eMed and an expert in the epidemiology, immunology and spread of infectious disease.\n\nThe increased concern about measles cases can be attributed to falling vaccination rates and to increased travel, which can result in unvaccinated people acquiring measles abroad and bringing it back to the US, according to the CDC, which occurred in 2019.\n\nHere’s how the cases this year compare to the past.\n\nMeasles was eliminated in the US in 2000. Imported cases are expected, but when vaccination rates are high, the risk remains low and outbreaks are rare. Outbreaks in 2019, particularly two in underimmunized Orthodox Jewish communities in New York, threatened measles elimination status in the US.\n\n“If a measles outbreak continues for a year or more, the United States could lose its measles elimination status,” according to the CDC.\n\nBecause measles is so contagious, a high level of vaccination coverage is key to minimizing spread. The US has set a target vaccination rate of 95%, but coverage among kindergarteners has dipped below that in recent years.\n\nMMR vaccine series completion among kindergarteners decreased from 95.2% during the 2019–2020 school year to 92.7% in the 2023–2024 school year, leaving about 280,000 at risk, according to the CDC.\n\nCoverage varies widely by state.', '', 'Updated 1:05 PM EDT, Fri April 25, 2025', 'tracking-measles-cases-in-the-united-states-1745808522'),

Kennedy made when talking about the rise in autism rates in the US.', 'Alison Singer has a few people she’d like Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to meet.\n\nSinger’s brother and daughter are two of the millions living with autism in the United States, and part of a much larger community that has very publicly expressed feeling hurt and disrespected by the US Health and Human Services secretary’s description of who they are and how they live.\n\n“He clearly doesn’t understand either one of them,” said Singer, president of the Autism Science Foundation.\n\nSinger’s daughter lives and works on a farm where she takes care of animals and grows and sells crops, and her brother lives in group home where he delivers meals on wheels to homebound senior citizens, she said. They’re both loving individuals who are active members of the community and family, she said.\n\nBut Kennedy “made it sound like these were people whose lives were worthless, when that couldn’t be further from the case,” Singer said.\n\nAt his first news conference as head of HHS, Kennedy said this week that the rising rate of autism in the country is an “individual tragedy” and “catastrophic for our country.”\n\nA new report from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that autism rates in 8-year-olds in the US rose from 1 in 36 in 2020 to 1 in 31 in 2022. The increase continues a long-term trend that experts have largely attributed to better understanding of and screening for the condition.\n\nBut Kennedy has rejected that concept, instead pushing the idea that autism is “preventable” and part of a “chronic disease epidemic” that “destroys” children and families.\n\n“These are kids who will never pay taxes. They’ll never hold a job. They’ll never play baseball. They’ll never write a poem. They’ll never go out on a date. Many of them will never use a toilet unassisted,” Kennedy said Wednesday.\n\nPeople with autism, their families and advocates were quick to refute Kennedy’s comments.\n\nDr. Peter Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at the Baylor College of Medicine, is a vaccine researcher who has an adult daughter with autism whom he wrote a book about.\n\n“My adult daughter Rachel, works everyday, pays taxes, has friends, loves going to the movies, and listens to lousy (IMO) music. She has a meaningful and thoughtful life,” he wrote in a social media post on Thursday. “Our U.S. Dept of HHS has lost all of its humanity, compassion, and intellectual curiosity.”\n\nAdvocates and researchers alike say that Kennedy’s narrow description of autism – his characterization of both the science and the experience of what living with it can be like – is reductive and harmful.\n\nKennedy’s rhetoric sets the US back at least a decade to a time rife with damaging stigma around autism that the community has fought hard to change, said Zoe Gross, director of advocacy at the Autistic Self Advocacy Network, one of a group of leading autism advocacy organizations that released a joint statement Thursday about these concerns.\n\n“He set up this litmus test of what it is to be a person and have a valuable life,” said Gross, who is autistic. “It’s not acceptable to talk that way anymore because of the work that we’ve done.”\n\nIn a social media post on Friday, leadership from technology company Aspiritech championed dozens of people on the team – more than 90% of whom have autism, it says – and highlighted ways that its tax-paying employees directly contradict the picture Kennedy painted of autism.\n\n“We’d like you to meet 100 people who will help dispel the many misconceptions about autistic people that seem to be driving a false narrative,” the company wrote, inviting Kennedy to visit its offices in Chicago. “We’d like to talk to you about how the idea of a cure feels like you don’t want autistic people to exist. Autism is a birth-to-death condition, and many diagnosed autistic people view it as a critical piece of their identity.”\n\nAutism spectrum disorder, or ASD, refers to a broad range of neurodevelopmental conditions characterized by challenges with communication skills and social skills. People with autism “may behave, communicate, interact, and learn in ways that are different from most other people,” according to the CDC, and “the abilities of people with ASD can vary significantly.”\n\nDr. Lisa Settles, director of Tulane University’s Center for Autism and Related Disorders, has spent more than 20 years in autism research and worked with thousands of patients. None of her patients has been exactly alike, but all of them have value, she said.\n\n“To me, it’s very obvious that [Kennedy] doesn’t know a lot about the diagnosis,” she said. “He’s pulling things together into a theory that isn’t based in any ounce of science, and it’s really frustrating to those of us who are professionals.”\n\nKennedy later went on Fox News to “set the record straight.” He doubled down on the limitations that he says people with autism have but clarified that he was specifically talking about the 1 in 4 people with autism who have “severe autism.”\n\nA CDC report from 2023 shows that about 27% of 8-year-olds with autism were considered to have “profound autism,” defined as children who were nonverbal, were minimally verbal or had an intelligence quotient (IQ) less than 50. That report analyzed data from 2000 to 2016.\n\nThe latest CDC report did not include an analysis using this criteria. But other data on the cognitive level of children with autism contradicts Kennedy’s claim that “most cases now are severe” or that these cases are driving the rise in prevalence. CDC data from 2022 shows that about 40% of 8-year-olds with autism had an IQ of 70 or less, up less than 2 percentage points from 2020 when about 38% did.\n\nEarly diagnosis of autism is easiest in children who have greater support needs, experts say.\n\n“We see them because they’re not meeting their developmental milestones,” Settles said. “They have speech delay or total lack of speech, so those are going to be the kiddos that are picked up diagnostically first.”\n\nBut some kids with autism who have lower support needs might continue to meet developmental milestones until age 8 or later, and those cases would be missed in the data that the CDC is analyzing, she said.\n\nAdvocacy groups over the years have worked to raise awareness to help parents and others understand what their child might be experiencing and seek out a diagnosis.\n\n“If the more severe cases are going to be the ones that are brought to your attention earlier, then it may look like the severe cases are increasing. But if you look overall, it’s really that we diagnose just as many kids with a level one as we do a level three,” Settles said.\n\nAnd Kennedy’s use of outdated terminology like “severe” is not in line with current science and can have damaging negative connotations, she said.\n\n“Clinically and professionally, we don’t use the word severe,” Settles said. “It’s really short-changing the individuals with autism, it’s short-changing the families, and it’s hurtful.”\n\nKennedy has launched a “massive testing and research effort” at HHS to determine the cause of the “autism epidemic,” promising some answers as early as September. There are differing opinions in the autism community about the importance of searching for a cause when limited resources may be better spent understanding how to build support for people living with autism. But there’s broad agreement that Kennedy’s laser focus on environmental toxins is problematic, especially if he continues question science that has already proved that vaccines do not cause autism.\n\n“This was the most exciting time in research. Things that we thought five years ago sounded like science fiction were actually happening,” Singer said. “All that is now under threat to be derailed in favor of more research on vaccines.”\n\nAnd advocates emphasize that even if most people with autism can do the things that Kennedy said they can’t, those who may need more support deserve more respect.\n\n“If someone can’t do any of those things because of their disability, it doesn’t mean they can’t have a good life,” Gross said. “They deserve better than being a rhetorical prop.”', '', 'Updated 9:58 AM EDT, Fri April 25, 2025', 'many-in-the-autism-community-say-rfk-jr-is-pushing-harmful-and-regressive-rhetoric-about-who-they-are-1745808522'),

About 40% of organizations whose grants the NIH cut in its first month of slashing, which started Feb. 28, are in states Trump won in November.\n\nThe Trump administration has singled out Ivy League universities including Columbia and Harvard for broad federal funding cuts. But the spending reductions at the NIH, the nation’s foremost source of funding for biomedical research, go much further: Of about 220 organizations that had grants terminated, at least 94 were public universities, including flagship state schools in places such as Florida, Georgia, Ohio, Nebraska, and Texas.\n\nThe Trump administration has canceled hundreds of grants supporting research on topics such as vaccination; diversity, equity, and inclusion; and the health of LGBTQ+ populations. Some of the terminations are a result of Trump’s executive orders to abandon federal work on diversity and equity issues. Others followed the Senate confirmation of anti-vaccine activist Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees the NIH. Many mirror the ambitions laid out in Project 2025’s “Mandate for Leadership,” the conservative playbook for Trump’s second term.\n\nAffected researchers say Trump administration officials are taking a cudgel to efforts to improve the lives of people who often experience worse health outcomes — ignoring a scientific reality that diseases and other conditions do not affect all Americans equally.\n\nKFF Health News found that the NIH terminated about 780 grants or parts of grants between Feb. 28 and March 28, based on documents published by the Department of Health and Human Services and a list maintained by academic researchers. Some grants were canceled in full, while in other cases, only supplements — extra funding related to the main grant, usually for a shorter-term, related project — were terminated.\n\nAmong U.S. recipients, 96 of the institutions that lost grants in the first month are in politically conservative states including Florida, Ohio, and Indiana, where Republicans control the state government or voters reliably support the GOP in presidential campaigns, or in purple states such as North Carolina, Michigan, and Pennsylvania that were presidential battleground states. An additional 124 institutions are in blue states.\n\nSybil Hosek, a research professor at the University of Illinois-Chicago, helps run a network that focuses on improving care for people 13 to 24 years old who are living with or at risk for HIV. The NIH awarded Florida State University $73 million to lead the HIV project.\n\n“We never thought they would destroy an entire network dedicated to young Americans,” said Hosek, one of the principal investigators of the Adolescent Medicine Trials Network for HIV/AIDS Interventions. The termination “doesn’t make sense to us.”\n\nNIH official Michelle Bulls is director of the Office of Policy for Extramural Research Administration, which oversees grants policy and compliance across NIH institutes. In terminating the grant March 21, Bulls wrote that research “based primarily on artificial and nonscientific categories, including amorphous equity objectives, are antithetical to the scientific inquiry, do nothing to expand our knowledge of living systems, provide low returns on investment, and ultimately do not enhance health, lengthen life, or reduce illness.”\n\nAdolescents and young adults ages 13 to 24 accounted for 1 in 5 new HIV infections in the U.S. in 2022, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\n“It’s science in its highest form,” said Lisa Hightow-Weidman, a professor at Florida State University who co-leads the network. “I don’t think we can make America healthy again if we leave youth behind.”\n\nHHS spokesperson Emily Hilliard said in an emailed statement that “NIH is taking action to terminate research funding that is not aligned with NIH and HHS priorities.” The NIH and the White House didn’t respond to requests for comment.\n\n“As we begin to Make America Healthy Again, it’s important to prioritize research that directly affects the health of Americans. We will leave no stone unturned in identifying the root causes of the chronic disease epidemic as part of our mission to Make America Healthy Again,” Hilliard said.\n\nThe NIH, with its nearly $48 billion annual budget, is the largest public funder of biomedical research in the world, awarding nearly 59,000 grants in the 2023 fiscal year. The Trump administration has upended funding for projects that were already underway, stymied money for new applications, and sought to reduce how much recipients can spend on overhead expenses.\n\nThose changes — plus the firing of 1,200 agency employees as part of mass layoffs across the government — are alarming scientists and NIH workers, who warn that they will undermine progress in combating diseases and other threats to the nation’s public health. On April 2, the American Public Health Association, Ibis Reproductive Health, and affected researchers, among others, filed a lawsuit in federal court against the NIH and HHS to halt the grant cancellations.\n\nTwo National Cancer Institute employees, who were granted anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the press and feared retaliation, said its staff receives batches of grants to terminate almost daily. On Feb. 27, the cancer institute had more than 10,800 active projects, the highest share of the NIH’s roughly two dozen institutes and centers, according to the NIH’s website. At least 47 grants that NCI awarded were terminated in the first month.\n\nKennedy has said the NIH should take a years-long pause from funding infectious disease research. In November 2023, he told an anti-vaccine group, “I’m gonna say to NIH scientists, ‘God bless you all. Thank you for public service. We’re going to give infectious disease a break for about eight years,’” according to NBC News.\n\nFor years, Kennedy has peddled falsehoods about vaccines — including that “no vaccine” is “safe and effective,” and that “there are other studies out there” showing a connection between vaccines and autism, a link that has repeatedly been debunked — and claimed falsely that HIV is not the only cause of AIDS.\n\nKFF Health News found that grants in blue states were disproportionately affected, making up roughly two-thirds of terminated grants, many of them at Columbia University. The university had more grants terminated than all organizations in politically red states combined. On April 4, Democratic attorneys general in 16 states sued HHS and the NIH to block the agency from canceling funds.\n\nResearchers whose funding was stripped said they stopped clinical trials and other work on improving care for people with HIV, reducing vaping and smoking rates among LGBTQ+ teens and young adults, and increasing vaccination rates for young children. NIH grants routinely span several years.\n\nFor example, Hosek said that when the youth HIV/AIDS network’s funding was terminated, she and her colleagues were preparing to launch a clinical trial examining whether a particular antibiotic that is effective for men to prevent sexually transmitted infections would also work for women.\n\n“This is a critically important health initiative focused on young women in the United States,” she said. “Without that study, women don’t have access to something that men have.”\n\nOther scientists said they were testing how to improve health outcomes among newborns in rural areas with genetic abnormalities, or researching how to improve flu vaccination rates among Black children, who are more likely to be hospitalized and die from the virus than non-Hispanic white children.\n\n“It’s important for people to know that — if, you know, they are wondering if this is just a waste of time and money. No, no. It was a beautiful and rare thing that we did,” said Joshua Williams, a pediatric primary care doctor at Denver Health in Colorado who was researching whether sharing stories about harm experienced due to vaccine-preventable diseases — from missed birthdays to hospitalizations and job loss — might inspire caregivers to get their children vaccinated against the flu.\n\nHe and his colleagues had recruited 200 families, assembled a community advisory board to understand which vaccinations were top priorities, created short videos with people who had experienced vaccine-preventable illness, and texted those videos to half of the caregivers participating in the study.\n\nThey were just about to crack open the medical records and see if it had worked: Were the group who received the videos more likely to follow through on vaccinations for their children? That’s when he got the notice from the NIH.\n\n“It is the policy of NIH not to prioritize research activities that focuses gaining scientific knowledge on why individuals are hesitant to be vaccinated and/or explore ways to improve vaccine interest and commitment,” the notice read.\n\nWilliams said the work was already having an impact as other institutions were using the idea to start projects related to cancer and dialysis.\n\nCongress previously tried to ensure that NIH grants also went to states that historically have had less success obtaining biomedical research funding from the government. Now those places aren’t immune to the NIH’s terminations.\n\nSophia Newcomer, an associate professor of public health at the University of Montana, said she had 18 months of work left on a study examining undervaccination among infants, which means they were late in receiving recommended childhood vaccines or didn’t receive the vaccines at all. Newcomer had been analyzing 10 years of CDC data about children’s vaccinations and had already found that most U.S. infants from 0 to 19 months old were not adequately vaccinated.\n\nHer grant was terminated March 10, with the NIH letter stating the project “no longer effectuates agency priorities,” a phrase replicated in other termination letters KFF Health News has reviewed.\n\n“States like Montana don’t get a lot of funding for health research, and health researchers in rural areas of the country are working on solutions to improve rural health care,” Newcomer said. “And so cuts like this really have an impact on the work we’re able to do.”\n\nMontana is one of 23 states, along with Puerto Rico, that are eligible for the NIH’s Institutional Development Award program, meant to bolster NIH funding in states that historically have received less investment. Congress established the program in 1993.\n\nThe NIH’s grant terminations hit institutions in 15 of those states, more than half that qualify, plus Puerto Rico.\n\nThe NIH’s research funds are deeply entrenched in the U.S. health care system and academia. Rarely does an awarded grant stay within the four walls of a university that received it. One grant’s money is divvied up among other universities, hospitals, community nonprofits, and other government agencies, researchers said.\n\nErin Kahle, an infectious disease epidemiologist at the University of Michigan, said she was working with Emory University in Georgia and the CDC as part of her study. She was researching the impact of intimate partner violence on HIV treatment among men living with the virus. “They are relying on our funds, too,” she said.\n\nKahle said her top priority was to ethically and safely wind down her nationwide study, which included 418 people, half of whom were still participating when her grant was terminated in late March. Kahle said that includes providing resources to participants for whom sharing experiences of intimate partner violence may cause trauma or mental health distress.\n\nRachel Hess, the co-director of the Clinical & Translational Science Institute at the University of Utah, said the University of Nevada-Reno and Intermountain Health, one of the largest hospital systems in the West, had received funds from a $38 million grant that was awarded to the University of Utah and was terminated March 12.\n\nThe institute, which aims to make scientific research more efficient to speed up the availability of treatments for patients, supported over 5,000 projects last year, including 550 clinical trials with 7,000 participants. Hess said that, for example, the institute was helping design a multisite study involving people who have had heart attacks to figure out the ideal mix of medications “to keep them alive” before they get to the hospital, a challenge that’s more acute in rural communities.\n\nAfter pushback from the university — the institute’s projects included work to reduce health care disparities between rural and urban areas — the NIH restored its grant March 29.\n\nAmong the people the Utah center thanked in its announcement about the reversal were the state’s congressional delegation, which consists entirely of Republican lawmakers. “We are grateful to University of Utah leadership, the University of Utah Board of Trustees, our legislative delegation, and the Utah community for their support,” it said.\n\nHilliard, of HHS, said that “some grants have been reinstated following the appeals process, and the agency will continue to carry out the remaining appeals as planned to determine their alignment.” She declined to say how many had been reinstated, or why the University of Utah grant was among them.\n\nOther researchers haven’t had the same luck. Kahle, in Michigan, said projects like hers can take a dozen years from start to finish — applying for and receiving NIH funds, conducting the research, and completing follow-up work.\n\n“Even if there are changes in the next administration, we’re looking at at least a decade of setting back the research,” Kahle said. “It’s not as easy as like, ‘OK, we’ll just do it again later.’ It doesn’t really work that way.”\n\nKFF Health News intern Henry Larweh contributed to this report.\n\nKFF Health News is a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues and is one of the core operating programs at KFF — the independent source for health policy research, polling, and journalism.', 'Harm to HIV, vaccine studies', 'Published 7:00 AM EDT, Fri April 25, 2025', 'beyond-ivy-league-rfk-jrs-nih-slashed-science-funding-across-states-that-backed-trump-1745808522'),

We cannot allow vaccine-preventable conditions, such as measles and whooping cough, to become regularly occurring outbreaks here in the US again, causing needless suffering and death.”\n\nThey added that, “given [Kennedy’s] history as the leader of an anti-vaccine organization, it is only prudent to anticipate ways the secretary could in the future exert his authority to reduce vaccine accessibility and discourage lifesaving immunizations.”\n\nThe “initial feedback phase,” as Osterholm called it, will start this month and last until early August.\n\n“We don’t know what’s this is going to look like at the end, but we’ll only find out by listening to all of these groups,” Osterholm said. “At the end of that process, hopefully we can all look at it and come to a similar conclusion, that this is what’s necessary or not necessary to protect the vaccine enterprise.”', '', 'Updated 12:32 PM EDT, Thu April 24, 2025', 'concerned-about-us-vaccine-misinformation-and-access-public-health-experts-start-vaccine-integrity-project-1745808522');

They’re about to get featured in the bountiful bowls and salads that have become her signature on her Jackfruitful Kitchen Instagram account.\n\nBut the real MVP of this recipe developer’s kitchen is actually the palest thing you’ll find in that fridge: tofu.\n\nProtein is what people ask about when they learn Akerberg doesn’t eat any animal products. (She’s been vegan since October 2019 but prefers the more inclusive term “plant-based.”) You won’t get enough if your go-to vegan food sources are Doritos and Oreos, she noted.\n\nBut if you “strip things down to the basics and focus on whole foods, including my favorite ingredient, tofu, it’s definitely possible,” said Akerberg, author of “The Clean Vegan Cookbook” published in 2023.\n\n“I typically start every morning with a smoothie made with soy milk, spinach, banana and a plant-based protein powder that blends pea and rice protein,” Akerberg said. “I’m getting 45 grams of protein before the sun comes up.”\n\nFor other meals and snacks, Akerberg mixes in staples like beans, lentils, nuts, seeds and tempeh. All of these choices add up to around 100 grams of protein per day, she confirmed. That’s right on par with a common mark promoted during the current high-protein craze.\n\nThe recommended dietary allowance of protein for adults is 0.8 grams per kilogram of body weight per day, or 0.36 grams per pound. For reference, a 150-pound (68-kilogram) person would require 54 grams of protein daily to meet that mark. Nearly all men hit the protein goal or go over, and less than 8% of women fall short, according to estimates.\n\nOne of the best and most versatile ways Akerberg has found to get her fill of the muscle-building macronutrient is with tofu. Also known as bean curd, this soybean-based food contains all the essential amino acids, or protein building blocks, that the body can’t make itself.\n\nThe inclusion of all those amino acids means that tofu is what dietitians sometimes refer to as a “complete protein,” alongside animal products like eggs, meat and dairy. Tofu is made by curdling fresh soy milk, compressing it into a block, and allowing it to cool, similar to how cheese is made from cow’s milk.\n\nAkerberg is on a mission to change tofu’s reputation for being bland, boring or spongy —and convince others that it’s a blank slate solution to add more protein to their meals, too.\n\nYou need not be vegan to enjoy it, either: “I don’t think a diet needs to be black and white. I’m choosing to eat plant-based because it makes my body feel amazing, and I love the flavor of these foods. But if you just want to eat one plant-based meal a week or also add tofu to the menu on a day that includes eggs, beef or chicken, that’s also totally cool,” Akerberg said.\n\nHere are her four easy tips to prepare top-notch tofu recipes.\n\n“Many people think tofu is very spongy, soft or mushy, or they just don’t love the texture,” Akerberg said. “I get it, and if you choose firm or extra-firm tofu, you’re going to want to press it (between two plates with a heavy can or bottle on top) for about 30 minutes to remove excess water and create a meatier texture.”\n\nHowever, if you prefer to skip that pressing step, and especially if you’re new to tofu, “buy high-protein, extra-firm tofu. It eliminates the pressing; it has the meatiest texture; and has the nuttiest taste.”\n\nThe quickest and easiest way to cook tofu doesn’t even require you to preheat your oven or grill, Akerberg explained.\n\nTo a nonstick skillet coated in cooking spray or a thin layer of oil, add cubes, slabs, triangles or sticks of pressed firm or extra-firm tofu or as-is high-protein tofu. Spread the pieces out in a single layer and sear over medium-low heat for about four minutes per side, or until the surface is golden and releases from the pan easily. Cook for slightly less time on the other side, and you’ll be treated to tofu “that almost tastes like it’s been deep-fried but hasn’t. Toss it in whatever seasoning, sauce or dressing you want afterward, and it’s amazing.”\n\n“Tofu has a neutral, slightly nutty taste, so it takes on any flavor of sauce or seasoning you pair it with,” Akerberg said. “Many cooks love to marinate tofu, which works great. But if you’re pan-searing or baking tofu, it doesn’t even need a marinade.”\n\nShe suggested a far quicker and easier alternative: Toss cubes of firm tofu with coconut aminos (a low-sodium, soy sauce-like condiment made from the fermented sap of coconut flowers), then sprinkle them with spices and bake or sear. You’ll see this method come to life in the Tofu Shawarma Bowl recipe below.\n\n“The coconut aminos help the seasonings stick, and it has slight sweetness and deep umami flavor. It does magical things with tofu, because tofu is such a blank slate,” Akerberg said.\n\nOn the seasoning side, Akerberg is wild about blackening seasoning, cumin, paprika, garlic powder and onion powder. Nutritional yeast, a high-protein vegan product solid in flakes or powders and made from deactivated baking yeast, tastes savory and cheesy — and is the key ingredient to transform tofu into a scrambled egg substitute.\n\nYou also can get saucy after cooking tofu, too, she said. Try drizzling or coating cubes of tofu in your favorite peanut sauce, barbecue sauce or Buffalo sauce to recreate the flavors of familiar dishes you dig.\n\nFirm tofu of all kinds is ideal when you’re seeking something sturdy enough to stand up to searing, stir-frying, scrambling, baking or grilling, Akerberg said. But don’t pass by its cousin: silken tofu.\n\n“Silken tofu is unpressed and has a higher water content than firm tofu. The texture is very similar to a thick yogurt, custard or pudding. Because of that, it’s phenomenal for desserts and smoothies,” Akerberg explained.\n\nHer favorite use is in chocolate mousse; a dessert that completely disguises the tofu in a whipped, cocoa-flavored cloud. Silken tofu also shines in savory sauces and soups like Creamy High-Protein Gochujang Noodles and Creamy Sweet Corn Soup.\n\n“It’s a terrific swap for those who are in their cottage cheese or Greek yogurt era,” Akerberg said, hinting at the fact that it can often step in as a swap for those trendy dairy products.\n\nAllergic or sensitive to soy? Tofu isn’t off the table. Look for a soy-free tofu made with fava beans, pumpkin seeds, chickpeas or almonds, Akerberg advised.\n\nServes 4\n\nPrep time: 15 minutes\n\nTotal cooking time: 40 minutes\n\n1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit and line a large baking sheet with parchment paper. Add cubed tofu to a bowl and drizzle with coconut aminos and spices. Toss to combine.\n\n2. Spread on the baking sheet and bake for 20 to 25 minutes until crispy.\n\n3. Give the bowl a quick rinse and dry, and add the cucumber, onion, avocado, cherry tomatoes, parsley, red wine vinegar and lemon juice. Stir to combine and season to taste with salt and pepper.\n\n4. Divide the mixed greens among four serving bowls. Top with couscous, cucumber salad, hummus and crispy tofu.\n\n5.

They eat lots of fruits, vegetables, nuts, lean meats and fish, while cutting out dairy products, sugar, grains, legumes and highly processed foods.\n\nThe restrictions of eating Paleo have started to rankle with Paltrow, however. “I’m a little sick of it if I’m honest,” she continued. “I’m getting back into eating some sourdough bread and some cheese. There, I said it. A little pasta. After being strict with it for so long.”\n\nNevertheless, she maintained that “it’s a good, sort of, template, right? Eating foods that are kind of as whole and fresh as possible.”\n\n“It is great to hear that Gwyneth is adding back into her very restrictive diet. This is definitely a good thing,” Priya Tew, a specialist dietitian and spokesperson for the British Dietetic Association, told CNN on Friday.\n\n“It sounds like Gwyneth is moving towards a more balanced and nutritious diet. Considering her realm of influence it is good to hear that she is finding this of benefit,” she added.\n\n“Nutrition research shows us that cutting out whole food groups is not good for our overall health. We need diversity and variety to help us meet all our nutritional needs, to bring taste into out diets and prevent boredom and to also bring pleasure!” Tew continued.\n\nThe Paleo diet is not the first strict eating regimen that Paltrow has tried.\n\nShe told podcast listeners that her father was diagnosed with throat cancer when she was around the age of 26, and it was “at that time that I started wondering, really through trying to see if there was anything we could do to help my father, if there was any kind of intersection between wellness and food.”\n\n“I went into hardcore macrobiotics for a certain time,” she added. “That was an interesting chapter, where I got kind of obsessed with eating very, very healthily. I think that was – I was really trying to heal my dad by proxy and he just didn’t really want anything to do with it.”\n\nPeople on a macrobiotic diet aim to avoid foods that contain toxins, with many eating only vegan foods, according to the charity Cancer Research UK’s website. The diet also involves strict rules, such as only eating when hungry, only drinking when thirsty, not having any vitamin or mineral supplements, and avoiding cooking with electricity or using a microwave oven.\n\nIt was developed in the 1920s by Japanese philosopher George Ohsawa, who believed the diet could help us live in harmony with nature and cure cancer and other serious illnesses, according to the charity. However, there is no scientific evidence that supports the idea that this diet can prevent or cure cancer.\n\n“As a dietitian I would not agree that there is enough evidence to prove a macrobiotic diet is a cure for throat cancer or that a Paleo diet is beneficial, either,” said Tew.\n\n“Carbohydrates are a vital part of our diets, providing fibre, B vitamins and energy. They are also key for our gut microbiome and also bring taste and enjoyment to meals!” she added.\n\nGoop, which Paltrow founded in 2008, has faced criticism over the years from various quarters. In 2018, prosecutors in California hit it with penalties totaling $145,000 for “unsubstantiated claims” relating to vaginal eggs and an essential oil-like product.', '', 'Published 11:26 AM EDT, Fri April 25, 2025', 'gwyneth-paltrow-has-started-eating-carbs-and-cheese-again-1745808522'),

Kennedy Jr., stirring questions about whether seasonal flu shots or other lifesaving vaccines will be delayed or harder to access.\n\nThe February meeting of the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP, was postponed “to accommodate public comment,” according to a note online. The three-day meeting, which had been scheduled for this week, was to review the safety and effectiveness of vaccines for meningococcal disease, which is seeing a resurgence, as well as RSV, flu, chikungunya and mpox. It also included two votes related to Vaccines for Children, the government program that buys and distributes vaccines to state and local health departments for children whose families wouldn’t otherwise be able to pay for them.\n\nACIP typically meets three times a year, in February, June and October. There’s no word on whether or when the February meeting will be rescheduled and it’s unclear whether the delay will hinder access to shots.\n\nOn Wednesday, the FDA canceled a March 13 meeting of its Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee, which was to discuss the recipe manufacturers must follow to make this fall’s flu shots. No explanation was given for the cancellation.\n\nIn a statement to CNN on Thursday, the FDA said it would still weigh in on the makeup of flu shots but didn’t indicate whether it would seek its advisers’ guidance or allow for the public discussion and debate that usually occurs.\n\n“The FDA will make public its recommendations to manufacturers in time for updated vaccines to be available for the 2025-2026 influenza season,” the statement said.\n\nThe uncertainty around the government’s process for regulating and recommending vaccines comes as the US is in the grips of a brutal flu season and experiencing a resurgence of measles, a vaccine preventable disease. Experts say these infections are increasing because of growing hesitancy to use vaccines, something they fear the new HHS director will only encourage.\n\nKennedy maintains that he is not anti-vaccine, but he has repeatedly cast doubt on the safety and effectiveness of immunizations and questioned the research and regulations that allow them to be used.\n\nKennedy, whose financial disclosures show he has made money from law firms that sue vaccine manufacturers, has also impugned some of the experts who advise federal agencies on vaccines. During his confirmation hearings, Kennedy incorrectly stated that 97% of the members of the CDC’s vaccine advisory committee had conflicts of interest. In fact, the panel has strict policies to guard against conflicts, and a screening process for members to ensure they are impartial when they vote.\n\nMembers of FDA’s vaccine committee are also subject to strict conflict of interest rules and are required to disclose potential conflicts during meetings.\n\nThis week, former CDC Director Dr. Tom Frieden wrote that false claims that ACIP members vote based on their financial ties is among the “most damaging” falsehoods about vaccines.\n\nFrieden said the 97% figure comes from a 2009 report, issued when he was CDC director. He is now president and CEO of the nonprofit Resolve to Save Lives.\n\nIt was an audit of lengthy and detailed conflict of interest forms submitted by all experts who served as CDC advisers in 2007. He said 97% had at least one missing response, which could have meant someone forgot to do something as simple as initial a page. He said it is not the same thing as a conflict of interest.\n\n“I really think that this is classic misinformation,” Frieden told CNN.\n\nFrieden also raised alarm about the postponed ACIP meeting, writing in a recent post on LinkedIn, “It’s certain there will be misleading, inaccurate information claiming ACIP members have conflicts of interest. Here’s the plain truth: ACIP, made up of pediatricians, public health specialists, and parents, is the gold standard for open, transparent recommendations on vaccine safety and effectiveness.”\n\nWithout either vaccine committee weighing in on vaccine regulation or recommendations, health-care providers worry there will be delays on vaccines or limits on people’s ability to access them.\n\n“Cancelling this meeting means vaccine makers may not have the vital information and time they need to produce and distribute targeted vaccines before the next flu season,” Dr. Tina Tan, president of the Infectious Diseases Society of America, said after the cancellation of the FDA flu shot meeting. “If the FDA meeting is not immediately rescheduled, many lives that could be saved by vaccination will be lost.”\n\nIn a February 20 open letter to Kennedy, Acting CDC Director Dr. Susan Monarez and Sen. Bill Cassidy, a doctor and chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, a coalition of groups called the Partnership to Fight Infectious Disease pushed for the “prompt rescheduling” of the ACIP meeting.\n\n“Each ACIP meeting holds tremendous weight and relevance. Infectious diseases are constantly evolving opponents; vaccines are among the best tools for constantly adapting and responding to the latest public health threats,” the letter said.\n\n“Making America healthy requires healthy discussion and timely, evidence-based decisions. This meeting should be no different.”\n\nThere are several different ways to make flu vaccines, but the most common is to grow the selected candidate viruses in chicken eggs — a painstaking operation that takes months to finish.\n\nFor that reason, selection of the strains that will be included in flu vaccines is carefully orchestrated to be sure that manufacturers can deliver their shots to doctor’s offices and pharmacies in time.\n\nIn order for flu vaccines to be sold in the US, they must contain strains that are officially selected by the FDA.\n\nThat decision typically comes after a meeting of the World Health Organization’s Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System, a network of seven collaborating centers and four essential regulatory labs, which are based in the US, UK, Japan, China, Russia and Australia. Both the CDC and FDA are members, and representatives from both agencies participated in the deliberations which got underway this week, WHO said.\n\n“The US did participate in this meeting,” Dr. Maria Van Kerkhove, WHO’s technical lead for Covid-19, said at a news briefing on Friday.\n\n“I want to be very clear that the US is still contributing. I know that there’s a lot of attention on the US right now, but we are going to continue to emphasize the importance of this global system that’s in place.”\n\nThese experts meet twice a year — in the fall and spring — to choose strains for countries in the Southern and Northern Hemispheres.\n\nOn Friday, WHO announced the strains that it thinks will most closely match the viruses that will be making people sick next fall. Those picks would swap out the H3N2 component of this years vaccine, which was only a partial match to the circulating viruses, for a new one.\n\n“I think the match is not perfect, but it is a reasonable match, and is still the best preventative we have against infection with influenza,” said Prof. Ian Barr, deputy director at the Victorian Infectious Diseases Reference Laboratory, and a member of GISRS, in a new briefing after the strain selection\n\nWhat typically happens next is that the 17-member FDA vaccine committee would meet and publicly discuss the recommendation, and then make its own endorsement. The agency ultimately makes the final decision, which can differ from its advisers’, although they generally align.\n\nThis year, there won’t be an advisory meeting. The FDA said it would still make recommendations to manufacturers but didn’t specify how it would come to a decision or when.\n\n“If there’s no FDA recommended strains, the US manufacturers are kind of stuck,” said Dr. LJ Tan who is chief policy and partnerships officer for nonprofit vaccine advocacy group Immunize.org.\n\nFlu vaccine manufacturers contacted by CNN on Thursday said the missed VRBPAC meeting wouldn’t break their stride.\n\n“Just as every year, we have already begun production for the 2025-2026 flu season in the Northern Hemisphere and will be ready to support final strain selections in time for the season,” wrote Sanofi in a statement to CNN.\n\nGSK also said it will continue to work with FDA on its flu strain recommendation in the US.\n\nBut canceling the VRBPAC meeting will deprive Americans of public discussion and debate that happens when these experts meet. It makes the process less transparent, Immunize.org’s Tan said.\n\n“It’s very dangerous to bypass your expert advisory committee,” Tan said.\n\nIn his Senate confirmation hearings, Kennedy promised “radical transparency” at HHS.\n\n“Public health agencies should be transparent and if we want Americans to restore trust in the public health agencies, we need transparency,” Kennedy said.\n\nVaccine advocates say canceling advisory committee meetings undermines that goal.\n\n“You heard what we thought. We disagreed on some things, and for people who are interested, you can see how we arrived at the conclusion that we did,” said Dr. Stanley Perlman, a member of FDA’s VRBPAC who is also a pediatrician and immunologist at the University of Iowa.\n\nPerlman said he was also worried that skipping committee meetings would deprive the public of a window into the government’s vaccine decisions.\n\n“The country is in so much flux right now about what it thinks about vaccines, what it thinks about medical devices, what it thinks about drugs. The more transparency there is, hopefully, the more people who are undecided about things will see where the committee is coming from,” Perlman told CNN’s Meg Tirrell.\n\nOther experts agreed the committees are an important layer of independent review.\n\n“It’s kind of taking experts out of the conversation,” said Dr. William Moss, a pediatrician who directs of the International Vaccine Access Center at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. “Many of these decisions are tricky and nuanced, and having the opportunity for a group of experts who are familiar with these vaccines and familiar with these diseases. You know, have an open discussion is critically important.”\n\nThe FDA has not said how it will choose vaccine strains for the fall, but if it follows WHO’s recommendation, it will mean that the US will be relying on data from the organization despite President Donald Trump’s order that the US withdraw its support from WHO and stop sharing information.\n\n“It’s part of the chaos, whether it’s planned or not, or just incompetence,” Moss said.\n\nCNN’s Meg Tirrell contributed to this report.', 'Kennedy casts doubt on vaccine advisers', 'Updated 12:27 PM EST, Fri February 28, 2025', 'disrupted-us-vaccine-meetings-could-threaten-timelines-access-and-transparency-around-shots-1745808522'),

Anderson Lepeco, a researcher at the Museum of Zoology of the University of São Paulo, said he came across the “extraordinary” specimen in September 2024 while examining a fossil collection housed at the Museum of Zoology of the University of São Paulo.\n\nThe museum has one of the world’s largest collections of fossilized insects and contains specimens from northeastern Brazil’s Crato Formation, a geological deposit renowned for its exceptional fossil preservation.\n\nPreserved in limestone, the newly described extinct insect is what’s known as a hell ant, a member of a subfamily called Haidomyrmecinae that lived during the Cretaceous period between 66 million and﻿ 145 million years ago and is not related to any ant alive today, according to a study published Thursday in the journal Current Biology. The fossil species, which has been named Vulcanidris cratensis, had scythe-like jaws that it likely used to pin or impale prey.\n\n“I was just shocked to see that weird projection in front of this (insect’s) head,” Lepeco, the study’s lead author, said. “Other hell ants have been described with odd mandibles, but always as amber specimens.”\n\nIt’s rare to find insects preserved in rock. Other hell ants from the Cretaceous have been found entombed in amber from France and Myanmar but they date back to around 99 million years ago. That a hell ant lived before that in what’s now Brazil means ants were already widely distributed across the planet at an early point in their evolution, the study authors noted.\n\nThe discovery sheds light on how ants evolved during the early Cretaceous, a time of significant change. It also offers some insight into unusual features in ant species of this period that didn’t survive the mass extinction that ended the dinosaur era, the researchers said.\n\nToday, ants are one of the most conspicuous and abundant groups of insects on the planet, found on all continents except Antarctica, the study noted.\n\nHowever, ants haven’t always been dominant. They evolved during the late Jurassic and early Cretaceous, roughly 145 million years ago, when ant ancestors diverged from the same group that would give rise to wasps and bees.\n\nIt wasn’t until after an asteroid strike doomed the dinosaurs and other species to extinction 66 million years ago that ants became the most common insect found in the fossil record, according to the study.\n\nThe fossil is a “pretty big deal,” said Phil Barden, an associate professor at the New Jersey Institute of Technology who studies the evolutionary history of insects.\n\n“This new find now represents the oldest ant known, it extends the known fossil record for ants by about ten million years,” Barden, who wasn’t involved in the study, said via email.\n\n“Although fossil ants have been described since the 19th century…Until now, it was not clear if the absence of ants older than 100 million years was because they were not around or just that they were not preserved in deposits where people were looking,” he added.\n\nThe newly identified species also had some wasp-like characteristics indicative of the common ancestry between the two creatures. For example, the ant’s wings had far more veins than those of living ants, Lepeco said.\n\nMicro-computed tomography imaging — a 3D-imaging technique that employs X-rays to view inside the ant — revealed that the bug was closely related to hell ants previously known only from Burmese amber fossils.\n\nWhat was most striking about the ant was its unusual anatomical features. Modern ants have jaws that grasp laterally — side to side.

The critter was believed to have lived among dinosaurs some 113 million years ago — several millennia before previously found ants, according to new research.\n\n“I was just shocked to see that weird projection in front of this (insect’s) head,” Lepeco said. “Other hell ants have been described with odd mandibles, but always as amber specimens.”\n\nAt wildlife conservancies in Africa, four-legged friends are invigorating efforts to combat poaching.\n\nProfessional dog trainers Darren Priddle and Jacqui Law of Carmarthen, Wales, spearhead the initiative, called Dogs4Wildlife.

A worm wriggled at its feet. The bird appeared to probe the silty earth with its beak, once, twice, three times, looking for food. On the fourth try, the bird may have found something. Or perhaps it missed again and moved on.\n\nThis glimpse into prehistory is possible thanks to two tiny fossil footprints and the dogged work of an undergraduate intern at John Day Fossil Beds National Monument with a particular interest in ancient tracks, known as trace fossils.\n\n“Trace fossils definitely do tell stories,” said Conner Bennett, lead author of a study describing the find and three others that was published in February in the journal Palaeontologia Electronica. “We don’t have the body of this bird. It’s more just like we’re left with its actions, its behaviors. It’s like trying to study ghosts.”\n\nTrace fossils can fill in gaps in the fossil record, said Dr. Anthony Martin, professor of practice in the department of environmental sciences at Emory University in Atlanta. “This paper has tracks that are definitely from a bird of some sort, and then tracks that are definitely from a lizard,” said Martin, who researches modern and fossil traces and was not involved in the research. “So those are showing that those animals actually were there, even though there’s not a single bone or feather or any other bodily evidence of those two types of animals being there.”\n\nThe science of trace fossils isn’t as “sexy” as studying bones, teeth and other physical remains, Bennett said. Fossilized tracks don’t get as much attention. That’s part of the reason he got the chance to undertake this research in the first place. Bennett, now a graduate student in the department of Earth, environmental and planetary sciences at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, applied for a summer internship at John Day in 2022. The national monument holds a rich paleontological record from the Eocene Epoch — part of the age of mammals — which lasted from about 56 million to 34 million years ago.\n\nBennett combed through the park’s online catalog of finds and came across several animal track impressions that had been found decades ago but never studied. He’d previously worked with 3D modeling software to describe dinosaur tracks and endeavored to give the unidentified animal tracks the same treatment.\n\nThe analysis could help researchers form a better understanding of the prehistoric ecosystems of Oregon. Bennett said he hopes his findings will inspire other researchers to look for trace clues they may have previously overlooked. “I’m sure it’s going to happen soon where people are like, ‘Oh, it’s really interesting to learn about fossil tracks. Let’s pull this stuff out of our archives and start looking at it.”\n\nWhile interning at John Day, Bennett took hundreds of overlapping photos of four sets of fossilized tracks, each only centimeters in size. He fed the pictures into the modeling software, which created 3D representations that could be blown up, zoomed in on and scrutinized in greater detail than the fossils.\n\nIn one, there were tracks that reminded him of a small shorebird, such as a plover. There aren’t bird fossils in John Day, he explained — the bones are fragile and hollow and don’t hold up well. But it would make sense that there would be such birds near the lake that once covered the area where the tracks were excavated.\n\nThere were also small, round indentations near the tracks. At first, Bennett and study coauthor Dr. Nicholas A. Famoso — the head paleontologist and museum curator at John Day — thought they could be caused by raindrops, which can leave impressions in the fine grains of shale and clay the tracks were found in. But there are usually many raindrop impressions, and here there were only a few, and only near the footprints. The researchers wondered whether the bird had made them with its beak. Bennett went online and quickly turned up a video of modern plovers pecking into the ground, hunting for food. The connection seemed clear to the research team.\n\nNot only did the trace fossil confirm the previously unproved existence of birds in the area tens of millions of years ago, but it also could paint a picture of how the birds foraged in the shallow water — much the way they do today. And to complete the picture, the fossil contained evidence of what the bird was feeding on or trying to feed on: the squiggly trail of a worm on the move. “We can track a feeding behavior over 50 million years. That’s pretty cool,” Bennett said.\n\nDr. Danielle Fraser, head of paleobiology at the Canadian Museum of Nature in Ottawa, who was not involved in this study, expressed a similar sentiment. “This is a really cool example of a behavior that would otherwise not be apparent,” she said.\n\nMartin suggested an alternative interpretation: that the divots could have been made by water droplets falling off the bird’s body as it came out of the water. “I’ve seen that a lot on the Georgia coast,” he noted.\n\nA separate specimen showed three footprints made up of five thin, splayed digits and clawlike impressions, suggesting some small lizard once darted along the lakeshore. There were even marks showing where the lizard dragged its feet. The researchers found this exciting because there are few examples of tracks from small lizards in North America in this period, and no body fossils have been unearthed at John Day.\n\n“Too few paleontologists are trained in the recognition and interpretation of trace fossils and so a lot of this information is overlooked,” said study coauthor Dr. Daniel I. Hembree, professor and director of undergraduate geology studies in the University of Tennessee department where Bennett is studying.\n\nThe traces are the only evidence of small lizards’ existence at John Day during the Eocene.\n\n“The fossils of the bird and lizard are the first evidence of those groups of animals from that period of time in our fossil record,” Famoso said. They “help to paint a more complete picture of what life was like” during the Eocene.\n\nBennett also analyzed two other trace fossils — from mammals from a more recent time period. One showed prints of a three-toed ungulate, possibly a rhinoceros or ancient tapir. The other: the 29 million-year-old tracks from what the researchers believe to be some sort of saber-toothed cat.\n\nThe absence of claw marks suggested that the animal’s claws were retractable, like those of modern cats. And the gait appears similar, too, Martin said. The way the rear paw print only partially overlaps the front means the animal may have been walking at a normal pace. “This is the kind of understep gait that I see in my cats at home,” he said. “I get kind of excited when I see something that looks so familiar.”\n\nFamoso noted that both sets of prints were found in an ash layer, which means the animals walked across an ash-laden landscape after a volcanic eruption.\n\n“Sometimes fossils are stored in collections until new technologies or methods are developed that can better study them,” he added. “These fossils were collected and added to collections between 1979 and 1987, but it took until 2022 for us to get a good study out to describe the specimens.”', 'A closer look at fossil tracks', 'Updated 10:18 AM EDT, Fri April 25, 2025', 'fossilized-footprints-reveal-unprecedented-insight-into-prehistoric-animal-behavior-in-oregon-1745808523'),

Yet research shows that regular users of marijuana are at risk for serious conditions, including strokes, heart attacks, cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure and myocarditis, which is an inflammation of the heart muscle.\n\nNow, an increased risk of dementia can be added to the list, according to a large study of more than 6 million people published April 14 in the journal JAMA Neurology.\n\n“Someone who has an emergency room visit or hospitalization due to cannabis has a 23% increased risk of dementia within five years compared to someone who was at the hospital for another reason. They have a 72% greater risk compared to the general population,” said study coauthor Dr. Daniel Myran, an assistant professor in the department of family medicine at the University of Ottawa in Canada.\n\n“Those numbers have already factored out other reasons for dementia, such as age, sex, mental health or substance use, and whether or not you have chronic conditions such as diabetes or heart disease,” Myran said.\n\nEarlier research shows marijuana users are nearly 25% more likely to need emergency care and hospitalization than nonusers.\n\n“However, this is not a study that anyone should look at and say, ‘Jury’s in, and cannabis use causes dementia,’” Myran said. “This is a study that brings up a concerning association that fits within a growing body of research.”\n\nThe study is a red flag for health professionals who should be screening for cannabis use disorder, said Dr. Robert Page II, a professor of clinical pharmacy and physical medicine at the University of Colorado Skaggs School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences in Aurora.\n\n“People with cannabis use disorder are unable to stop using even though they encounter health or social problems from use,” said Page, who chaired the medical writing group for the American Heart Association’s 2020 scientific statement on marijuana.\n\n“When they stop using it, they either have withdrawal symptoms or have very bad mental health symptoms,” he added. “They might have quite severe depression, or they might have anxiety, all of which can send them to the hospital.”\n\nThe potency of weed has skyrocketed over the years, which can heighten health risks and is leading to a global rise in marijuana addiction as well as cannabis use disorder, according to a 2022 study.\n\nAddiction to marijuana can happen to about 30% of people who use cannabis, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The disorder also comes with a higher risk of attention, memory and learning problems, the CDC finds.\n\n“The other takeaway from this study is that many people believe marijuana to be natural and therefore safe,” Page said. “It is a psychotropic medication, so it’s going to have psychotropic effects. If you have underlying psychiatric issues, realize that you need to be transparent with your provider and let them know if you’re using this medically or recreationally.”\n\nResearchers looked at medical records between 2008 and 2021 for more than 6 million people between the ages of 45 and 105 without dementia who lived in Ontario. Of those, over 16,000 had been seen due to negative responses to marijuana.\n\n“Within five years of an emergency room visit or hospitalization for cannabis, 5% of people were diagnosed with dementia, and within 10 years, 19% of people were diagnosed with dementia,” Myran said.\n\nRates of emergency room visits due to marijuana increased fivefold in adults between the ages of 45 and 64 and nearly 27-fold for people 65 and older during those 13 years, according to the study.\n\n“While this study was done in Canada, it should apply to all of North America including the US,” he added, pointing to a May 2024 study that shows daily or near daily use of marijuana surpassed alcohol by 2022.\n\nIf the connection between cannabis use and dementia does turn out to be causal, just how might marijuana trigger cognitive decline in regular users? One possibility is that daily or near daily use of marijuana changes neural connectivity in the brain, Myran said.\n\n“There’s certainly a pathway where there’s potential inflammation and microvascular damage from marijuana,” he said. “It could be that regular cannabis use causes people to develop other risk factors for dementia, such as depression, social isolation and lower educational attainment. And it could be that people who regularly use cannabis are more likely to have major trauma to the brain such as a motor vehicle collision.”', 'A red flag', 'Published 10:00 AM EDT, Sun April 20, 2025', 'marijuana-hospital-visits-linked-to-dementia-diagnosis-within-5-years-study-finds-1745808523');

If you work a traditional five-day workweek, you might relate to that feeling.\n\nBut if someone is in a constant loop of dreading Monday through Friday and only looking forward to days off, it might not be the most fulfilling way to live, psychology experts say.\n\n“It’s totally understandable, and a lot of people are living their lives in that way, but I don’t think it’s the most satisfying way,” said Dr. James Pawelski, professor of practice and director of education in the Positive Psychology Center at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\n“There are five weekdays and only two weekend days. So, if most of (the time) you’re looking back or you’re looking forward, you’re missing out on your life,” Pawelski said.\n\nWhether or not you have your dream job, there are ways to incorporate more activities you enjoy throughout the week to make the workdays more exciting. Here’s what Pawelski and other experts want you to know about finding that work-life balance rather than waiting for the weekend.\n\nAfter a busy workday, it’s tempting to want to go home and plop down on the couch for the rest of the evening — even Pawelski agrees. But sometimes an extra push to do a different activity after work can be more energizing and satisfying.\n\n“It’s a paradox — we think it’s taking a break that energizes, right? If you’re on empty, you just got to take a break until you feel more energy,” he said. “But it turns out that effort energizes.”\n\nInstead of scheduling every activity on the weekend, Pawelski recommends planning a fun or goal-focused activity during the week to keep momentum going after work.\n\nPawelski has started Thursday night improv classes with his wife, Suzann Pileggi Pawelski. And they both go, even when they’re tired.\n\n“When it comes around to Thursday night, and it’s been a crazy busy week. And if you said to me, ‘Would you like to go to improv right now? … or would you rather just kind of sit down and relax?’ I’d probably say, ‘You know what, I’m exhausted. I just want to sit down and relax,” Pawelski said. “But the thing is, it’s already scheduled. It’s paid for. We now have really good friends there. … And so, you know, you get to improv, and before long, it’s like, ‘Oh my goodness. This is so energizing.’”\n\nWhen the next day rolls around, it feels more satisfying to have followed through with your promises, even if it was hard in the moment, said Pileggi Pawelski, a well-being writer and positive psychology expert. The couple coauthored the book “Happy Together: Using the Science of Positive Psychology to Build Love That Lasts.”\n\nShared activities can also help build relationships and foster those moments to connect with people throughout the week, she added. “We live our lives in the moment, and unfortunately, a lot of people miss the opportunity to connect if you’re just waiting for the weekend, whether it’s with your romantic partner, your friends (or) colleagues at work.”\n\nTo make more meaningful interactions that feel less transactional than the usual small talk during the week, Pileggi Pawelski recommends setting a goal to learn something new about a person every day, asking them questions that relate to them and their individuality. Planned activities that both people find exciting, such as the improv classes, a team sport or a meetup for coffee and a puzzle, are also helpful to making these connections.\n\n“Our relationships and our social connections are the most important thing to well-being, and I think a lot of us lose ourselves in work,” she said. “Just think of something that brings you joy. There’s no right or wrong. … Plan that activity — ideally, you know, doing something with other people — and put it in your calendar to do it regularly.”\n\nBy adding in other activities outside work, people also tend to diversify their identities, which helps during the inevitable setbacks and failures throughout a career, said Dr. Emiliana Simon-Thomas, science director of the Greater Good Science Center at the University of California, Berkeley. The center is a research institute that studies the psychology, sociology and neuroscience of well-being.\n\nFor example, someone might think, “I might have missed that due date or lost that opportunity to do a project, because now we don’t have the funding for it,” Simon-Thomas added. “But my friends and neighbors are all so excited to talk with me about the book that we all read … or I have to show up and play second base (in baseball) on Tuesday, and I’m important, and I matter in those other contexts.”\n\nThe average person will spend an estimated one-third of their life at work — about 90,000 hours. If someone does not enjoy what they do during this large chunk of time, it can be “a huge problem,” said Dr. Sonja Lyubomirsky, a researcher on happiness and a distinguished professor of psychology at the University of California, Riverside.\n\nBut if someone is not able to switch jobs to something more in tune with their interests, there are other ways to spin a more positive outlook on work, said Lyubomirsky, who is also the author of the book “The How of Happiness: A Scientific Approach to Getting the Life You Want.”\n\nWhen thinking about your daily activities, ask yourself if “there is something you can find that you feel like, ‘maybe this is making the life of one person easier or better,’” Lyubomirsky said.\n\nEven by completing small tasks such as sending out an email at work, a person can relate this effort back to core values and goals, Simon-Thomas said.\n\nWhether someone is interested in a career path in science and studying longevity, or invested in the arts and hope to inspire future generations, these small tasks can point to larger goals, she said. Tell yourself something like, “I’m answering those emails so that I can accomplish this particular task, which will enable us to commence this project. And this project is in the service of this bigger aim or vision or goal that’s so valuable to me,” she added.\n\nIt is also important to foster relationships in the workplace, Lyubomirsky said, and research has shown that having conversations with people throughout the day can cause small bursts of positive emotions. Those bursts can also come from treating oneself to things such as a sweet treat or a walk in the park during a work break, she said.\n\n“The hallmark of happiness is the experience of frequent positive emotions. Positive emotions could be joy, but it could also be curiosity. It could be calm, pride, affection — it could be lots of things depending on the person,” Lyubomirsky said. “So (think to yourself), what are ways that you could create those little bursts of positive emotion?”', 'Structuring the weekdays', 'Updated 4:51 PM EDT, Sat April 19, 2025', 'what-these-experts-on-happiness-want-you-to-know-about-making-your-weekdays-more-fulfilling-1745808523'),

Or I focus on the past and wonder what I could have done to prevent all of this.\n\nMy thoughts get loud and crowded, screaming matches occur in my mind, and I start to feel tingling in my forearms. By morning, my patience is gone, my stress and anxiety are up, and my family can pay the price.\n\nDuring this latest pileup, I ran around trying to get a handle on everything, needing help but feeling overloaded so I didn’t ask for it.\n\nMy youngest son spotted trouble and warned his siblings: “Dad is doing that fast walk thing — watch out.” I’m usually patient with my three children, but when I’m overloaded, I become a tyrant with a short temper who barks orders. In these moments, my wife pulls me away just so I can breathe.\n\n“There are battles going on inside the minds of men,” said Dr. Jett Stone, a clinical psychologist based in Greenwich, Connecticut, and author of “Quiet Your Mind: A Men’s Guide: Practical Techniques to Stop Overthinking and Take Charge of Your Life.”\n\n“Men tend to externalize, which means that the inner stuff gets put out into the world, whether it’s reckless driving, drinking or hyperactivity,” said Stone, who specializes in men’s mental health. “Men are socialized into holding back their interior life.”\n\nStone gave me hope that it doesn’t have to be that way, sharing his guidance for how men can learn to calm our thoughts and take control of our actions.\n\nThis conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity.\n\nCNN: What are the health consequences of men overthinking about our lives?\n\nDr. Jett Stone: It can cause stress, and then your heart beats faster, your hands get clammy, and you might get a headache. Or maybe you feel something else. Everyone has different physical symptoms. One of the best places to catch overthinking is by noticing how your body feels. Sometimes it’s simpler for men to access their bodies than it is to access what’s going on in their minds.\n\nCNN: Why are men overthinking, and how can we stop doing it?\n\nStone: Men are being asked to take on more of the mental load, which includes emotional labor — which is the time spent helping to address, manage and regulate the emotions of your kids and yourself around parenting. They are also asked to take on more of the cognitive load, which is what you need to do as a parent. One example: I need to pick up the kids from a sports practice, which means I need to plan it and then execute it. It’s the executive function of being a modern parent. It’s laborious and invisible.\n\nWe are naturally going to feel more cluttered in our minds. It is a function of modern society demanding more of fathers and rightfully so.\n\nThe first step is recognizing and naming the overthinking. Even just calling that out to yourself is incredibly powerful. The next step would be to get in touch with the triggers of it. What are your particular triggers for overthinking when it comes to fatherhood?\n\nFor some dads, it comes with, “Am I spending enough quality time with my kids with the demands of work?” “Did I react too harshly?” “Can I provide enough for my family?” These are all questions that can set men off on mental loops.\n\nThe next step is to do a quick breathing routine like a cyclic sigh, which has really strong health benefits and really produces calm. Basically, it is two inhalations, followed by a really slow out-breath. You can combine this with a mindfulness technique called a body scan. Go from the top of your body to the bottom or vice versa and notice your body markers of your stress. Notice that tension in your shoulders, arms or wherever. Breathe into it, tense it up and relax it.\n\nCNN: You talk about mapping your thoughts. What is that, and how it can help?\n\nStone: Mapping is recognizing what triggers your overthinking and then asking where does this go. It’s pinpointing those moments.\n\nFor example, let’s say your boss gives you feedback about your underperformance in a meeting, and afterward, you find yourself stuck in a mental loop. Your mind might go from “I sounded so stupid in front of him” to “I’ll never be able to buy a home if I don’t make more money.”\n\nUsing mapping, you would slow down, shift your focus and begin to notice and categorize the path your mind takes. Instead of fueling the overthinking, you zoom out and map through writing or observing how your thoughts veered across themes: from self-image to financial security, all in one loop. These are some of the categories I include in the book.\n\nIn this example, one small interaction triggered a familiar mental route. “Mapping” this route using common categories helps you recognize where your mind tends to go when left to its own devices.\n\nCNN: Instead of churning through our thoughts, you say we need to find “our deeper drives.” What does that mean, and how do we do it?\n\nStone: Our deeper drives, a term from psychologist Steven Hayes’ work, are things like belonging, wanting to connect and be accepted by others, competence, to feel like you’re capable and effective. They are human needs.\n\nThis may require some solo contemplation, dialogue with friends, therapy or journaling. Ask yourself: “What am I seeking? Am I seeking something like belonging? Am I missing a sense of orientation in the world, meaning, fulfillment or direction?” It’s never usually one thing.\n\nIt can be incredibly liberating when you can pinpoint an unmet drive. It’s no longer about saying this is not just some silly insecurity that I have. It’s something all humans need.\n\nCNN: One way you suggest quieting the mind is to practice gratitude and kindness. How do you do that, and what are the benefits?\n\nStone: Juxtapose gratitude with overthinking. Overthinking is narrowly focused, while gratitude increases your field of vision. Helping others expands that visual field. It helps you gain perspective and move beyond the self-referential type of thinking into the outer world and where you need it, where you can lend a hand.\n\nShowing gratitude can be done in a text to friend, a phone call to your parent or verbally saying (something) to a spouse or partner. It can be as simple as saying thank you for cleaning the kitchen. A gratitude journal is a way to making yourself aware of what to be grateful for in your life. You can simply write down a couple of things or people you are grateful for each morning.\n\nCNN: How can fathers control their anger rather than lashing out at family, friends or ourselves?\n\nStone: There’s usually stuff that lives beneath the anger. Sometimes anger is righteous, justified and productive. Sometimes, it is unproductive anger, which is not effective.\n\nIf you notice you are angry, a stop sign needs to come up in your mind at that moment. Pause and just breathe. A lot of times we are not breathing in those moments. Taking the time to do that can take anger from a 10 to a 9.\n\nObserve it for a second and even just ask yourself one question. What do I want from this? What are my goals? It then can take that anger from an 8 to a 7. Anger can be really scary for family members, especially coming from a dad, because it’s a big, intimidating emotion.\n\nChannel that instinct and do a little bit of self-interrogation. The second question you can ask is what is living beneath? What emotions are living beneath this anger? Am I fearful of not being able to provide for my family? Am I feeling ashamed that I’m not holding my weight?\n\nCNN: What do you do when the man you want to be conflicts with the man whom you present to the world?\n\nStone: I would say that those aren’t two different parts of yourself. You are many selves, and both of those are part of who you are, but accepting that can be very hard. It’s a part of you, and you need to be aware of it.

Here’s how to correct that', 'https://edition.cnn.com/2025/04/18/health/posture-muscle-imbalances-in-workouts-wellness/index.html', 'Dana Santas', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/210414115509-life-but-better-fitness-logo-large-169.png?q=h_50', '', 'If you’ve been hitting the gym regularly and feeling stronger — but also stiffer and more slouched — you may be overlooking key elements that create balance in your workouts.\n\nDespite good intentions, many people unknowingly reinforce poor posture with their strength-training workouts, leading to tight muscles, restricted mobility and even chronic pain.\n\nA few simple adjustments can help you train smarter so that your workouts boost your strength while improving your posture, leaving you moving better in and out of the gym.\n\nYour posture reflects how your body balances and supports itself during movement. Ideally, that balance includes a fluid alignment of your head, shoulders, spine and pelvis. Having poor posture — with slumped shoulders, a rounded back and a forward head position — stems from muscular imbalances, in which some muscles are overworked and tight while others are underused and weak.\n\nUnfortunately, many common practices in strength-training workouts can reinforce these imbalances.\n\nConsider a training plan heavy on bench presses, push-ups and crunches. These moves all strengthen muscles on the front of your body, including the chest, abs and hip flexors, without addressing muscles on the back of your body that help support upright posture, such as the mid back, glutes and hamstrings. Over time, this imbalance can pull your body forward into a rounded, collapsed position.\n\nEven when your workouts are balanced, lifting with poor form, such as letting your shoulders hunch during rows or squats, can ingrain postural dysfunction. This issue becomes especially true when you perform the exercises repeatedly under load.\n\nThe good news is you don’t have to give up your favorite exercises. Try making these three strategic adjustments to keep building strength in a way that also improves your posture and mobility.\n\nOne of the simplest and most effective ways to support good posture through strength training is by creating balance in your workouts. For every pushing movement, such as push-ups or overhead presses, include a pulling movement such as rows or band pull-aparts.\n\nPulling movements activate the muscles in your upper and middle back that help counteract the forward-pulling effect of dominant front-body muscles. If, like most people, the movements of your daily life include a lot of reaching, pushing and sitting, ideally, you should include more pulling than pushing exercises in your workouts.\n\nYou also should balance lower body training to ensure that you are strengthening both the fronts and backs of your legs. Squats and lunges are great for your quads (upper front-leg muscles) and your glutes, but it’s also important to incorporate hinging movements, such as dead lifts and hip thrusts, which emphasize hamstring (upper back-leg muscles) strength.\n\nMobility work is not just for warm-ups or recovery days — it’s a critical part of training to maintain healthy posture and keep you moving well. Tight muscles from strength training can limit your range of motion. Without mobility work, you may start compensating in ways that increase joint stress and postural strain.\n\nAdd mobility drills that target commonly restricted areas, primarily the back, hips and shoulders. Even just five minutes of yoga or other intentional mobility work before or after your workout can reduce stiffness and enhance movement patterns.\n\nThree of my go-to mobility exercises to include in strength-training programs are:\n\n• Wall slides to activate postural muscles in your mid back and counteract overactive muscles in your neck and chest.\n\n• Three-way hip flexor release to mobilize your hips and reduce lower back tension.\n\n• Windmill twist to promote thoracic and shoulder mobility while opening your chest, releasing low-back tension and stretching the backs of your legs.\n\nForm matters, especially when it comes to posture. Practicing proper alignment during workouts reinforces good movement patterns that carry over into daily life.\n\nThat means paying attention to:\n\n• Head and neck position: Avoid jutting your chin forward or tensing your neck.\n\n• Shoulder positioning: Keep your shoulders down and back, not shrugged up toward your ears.\n\n• Spinal alignment: Maintain a neutral spine, avoiding excessive arching or rounding.\n\n• Breathing: Exhale during the effort phase of exercises (e.g., the pushing-up phase of a push-up) to support core engagement and help maintain stable posture.\n\nIf you’re unsure about your form, consider working with a certified personal trainer or filming yourself to check alignment during exercises. Try not to rely solely on mirrors, which, as you crane your neck to see yourself, can sometimes encourage unnatural head positions that throw off your posture.\n\nMaking these small changes to your workouts will deliver big benefits. By training smarter, you can more effectively build strength that supports good posture and healthy, pain-free movement.', 'How workouts can hurt posture', 'Updated 12:10 PM EDT, Fri April 18, 2025', 'working-out-can-make-your-posture-worse-heres-how-to-correct-that-1745808523'),

Do you need that third or fourth cup of coffee to make it through the afternoon at work? Such signs of sleepiness may be a red flag of a serious sleep deficit that could put you in physical danger and harm your long-term health, according to a new position paper by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine.\n\n“Sleepiness is a serious health concern with wide-reaching consequences,” said AASM President Dr. Eric Olson, a pulmonologist and sleep medicine specialist at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota.\n\n“From drowsy driving crashes to workplace errors and long-term health risks, the effects of excessive daytime sleepiness impact individuals and society every day,” Olson said in a statement about the paper, which is supported by 25 different medical organizations including the American Academy of Neurology, the National Safety Council and the American Academy of Family Physicians.\n\nNot getting a quality night’s rest of at least seven to eight hours has been linked to the development or worsening of diabetes, depression, heart and kidney disease, high blood pressure, obesity and stroke, experts say.\n\n“With one-third of U.S. adults reporting they experience excessive sleepiness, the importance of identifying interventions that recognize, assess, and treat it cannot be understated,” Olson added.\n\nAll too often people write off signs of sleepiness, such as dozing off during a work meeting, as an insignificant issue instead of a sign of a potentially dangerous sleep deficit, experts say.\n\n“Nodding off in boring meetings is an indication of insufficient sleep. Someone who is fully rested will not fall asleep in meetings, no matter how boring the meeting is,” said sleep specialist Kristen Knutson, an associate professor of neurology and preventive medicine at Northwestern University’s Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago.\n\n“Excessive daytime sleepiness can impair performance and be an indicator of underlying sleep disorders or other issues,” Knutson said via email. “If someone is experiencing excessive daytime sleepiness regularly, they should discuss this with their physician.”\n\nThe body does odd things when it’s continuously sleepy, including overcoming those yawns and sending signals that you are, in fact, coping with the lack of sleep. However, those signals couldn’t be further from the truth, said AASM board member and second author Dr. Indira Gurubhagavatula, a professor of sleep medicine at the Veteran’s Administration Medical Center at Penn Medicine in Philadelphia.\n\n“The unfortunate thing is data shows that with chronic partial sleep deprivation the ability to perceive our own level of impairment is no longer accurate — we think we’re OK when we’re really not,” Gurubhagavatula said.\n\n“When we do actual tests to measure how well your brain is functioning — reaction time, the ability to recall, memory tests, coordination — we find people are actually making a lot of mistakes,” she said. “And it’s scary because they still have this inappropriately high level of confidence that they are OK.”\n\nWith continued sleepiness, the brain may take mini naps, or what specialists call microsleeps, Gurubhagavatula said.\n\n“Your brain is actually going into brief two-second, three-second, 10-second microsleeps and then popping back out and you may not even realize this is happening,” she said. “It can be very dangerous if you’re driving or doing something that involves safety. So if you do feel like you might fall asleep, pay attention to that, as it’s an indication it’s not safe to drive.”\n\nAbout 100,000 car accidents a year are linked to drowsy driving, according to statistics.\n\nHow do you know if your sleepiness is crossing into the danger zone? You can measure it on various scales, including the Epworth Sleepiness Scale, Gurubhagavatula said.\n\nQuestions on the test include how likely you’ll fall asleep while sitting quietly after a lunch with no alcohol; lying down in the afternoon; sitting inactive in a public place; sitting and reading; sitting and chatting with someone; riding as a passenger in a car for an hour; sitting in traffic for a few minutes while driving; and watching television.\n\n“We ask patients to rate from zero to three how likely they are to fall asleep during these eight sedentary situations,” she said. “The maximum score is 24, which indicates that you’re very, very sleepy. We generally consider scores above 10 to being clinically significant and worth intervention.”\n\nAs sleep deprivation progresses, dangerous symptoms of sleepiness can increase, Gurubhagavatula said.\n\n“You have droopy eyelids, your body is slumping, you’re having trouble staying upright, and some people even notice vertigo, the room spinning, hands shaking with severe deprivation,” she said. “You can also be reckless and impulsive, like you don’t care. That’s another symptom.”\n\nSleep disorders such as sleep apnea, insomnia, restless leg syndrome and circadian rhythm sleep disorders, as well as chronic pain conditions and medications can also contribute to sleepiness, which will be ruled out by a sleep specialist.\n\n“You can also ask your pharmacist about your prescriptions, and you should also consider any over-the-counter medications,” Gurubhagavatula said.\n\nCertain lifestyle behaviors also can contribute to chronic sleepiness, experts say.\n\n“Things like too much caffeine, alcohol use before bed, using marijuana, the amount of exercise you’re doing, and practicing poor sleep hygiene, such as sleeping in a bright, cold, hot or noisy bedroom, will definitely affect how your sleep will be organized and how refreshing it’s going to be,” Gurubhagavatula said.\n\nMany people turn to alcohol or marijuana in the mistaken belief that it can improve sleep. While alcohol appears to make it easier to fall asleep, the body will wake in the middle of the night once the alcohol is metabolized, experts say.\n\n“I have patients that are very surprised how much better their sleep is when they get rid of that one drink they have with dinner,”Gurubhagavatula said.\n\n“As for marijuana, we know it actually has unwanted side effects on sleep. The efficiency of your sleep decreases, and how tired you feel the next day increases, so sleep quality actually starts to go down.”', 'A hidden danger', 'Updated 5:12 PM EDT, Thu April 17, 2025', 'yawning-may-be-more-dangerous-than-you-think-experts-say-1745808523'),

Atrial fibrillation, or A-fib, is the most common arrhythmia, characterized by an irregular and rapid heartbeat beginning in the upper chambers, or atria, of the heart. Bradyarrhythmias are abnormally slow heart rates of typically below 60 beats per minute, compared with the normal range of 60 to 100 beats per minute. Ventricular arrhythmias occur when the lower chambers of the heart, or ventricles, beat too fast.\n\n“The great thing about walking is that it is accessible to everyone,” said senior study author Dr. Jill Pell, the Henry Mechan Professor of Public Health at the University of Glasgow in Scotland, via email. “You don’t need to spend money going to a gym or buying equipment. You can just walk out of your front door and keep going.”\n\nNearly 60 million people worldwide have atrial fibrillation, according to a 2024 study. Estimates of people with other arrhythmias are less conclusive, but in general, people with arrhythmias are at higher risk of having heart attacks or strokes and dying early, Pell said.\n\n“There are medicines and procedures that can be offered to these people but it would be preferable to prevent heart rhythm abnormalities from occurring in the first place,” Pell added.\n\nAdditionally, to the authors’ knowledge, there has been only one previous study on walking pace and heart rhythm abnormalities, and it focused on just one type of arrhythmia, Pell said. And past research has indicated that “walking pace is linked to other outcomes such as cardiovascular disease, so we wanted to see if the same was true of heart rhythm abnormalities,” Pell said.\n\nThe authors studied health and activity data from adults who had been recruited between 2006 and 2010 for the UK Biobank study, which has followed the health outcomes of more than 500,000 people between the ages 40 and 69 in the United Kingdom. Participants answered questionnaires that asked whether their walking pace was slow (less than 3 miles or 4.8 kilometers per hour), average (3 to 4 miles or 4.8 to 6.4 kilometers per hour) or brisk (more than 4 miles or 6.4 kilometers per hour).\n\nDuring a follow-up period of 13 years on average, 9% of participants developed arrhythmias.\n\n“We had data on self-reported walking pace from more than 420,000 people but we also had accelerometry data on (nearly) 82,000 of these,” Pell said, referring to data from watches that track movement speed. “The data from the watches showed that walking at an average pace (3-4 miles per hour) for only 5-15 minutes per day was sufficient to reduce your risk.”\n\nThe associations were strongest among people under 60, people without obesity, those with high blood pressure or two or more preexisting conditions, and women, the authors found.\n\n“This is an interesting finding because, although women are less likely to get atrial fibrillation than men, when they do get it they are at a higher risk of going on to get heart attacks and strokes than men with atrial fibrillation,” Pell said.\n\nCardiologist Dr. Martha Gulati found the study important and said it confirms earlier related research — by herself and others — that showed benefits of physical activity for atrial fibrillation and stronger associations among women.\n\n“This shows that one of the primary prevention strategies to reduce cardiac arrhythmias is brisk walking,” added Gulati, director of preventive cardiology at the Smidt Heart Institute at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. Gulati wasn’t involved in the research.\n\nSince the study is observational, it doesn’t prove a cause and effect, the authors said. Self-reported health data is also vulnerable to inaccurate recollections or biases.\n\nIn observational studies, there’s always a risk that people who walk slower do so because they already have disease, Pell said.\n\n“We did everything possible to avoid this by making sure that no one had any type of heart or vascular disease at the beginning of the study,” she added. “However, we really need an intervention study now to confirm our findings: a study of people who walk slowly in which some are asked to increase their walking pace and some are not,” Pell said.\n\nA-Fib is associated with multiple risk factors that are also linked with conditions such as heart disease, diabetes, high blood pressure and obesity, said Dr. Sean Heffron, director of cardiovascular fitness and nutrition at the Center for the Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease at New York University. He was not involved in the study.\n\nParticipants who walked faster were more likely to be men, live in less deprived areas, have healthier lifestyles and weigh less. They also had better grip strength, smaller waists and lower levels of inflammation and metabolic risk factors such as high cholesterol or blood sugar.\n\n“And bradyarrhythmias or ventricular arrhythmias are nonspecific and can have lots of other causes and certainly are far less clearly associated with lifestyle-type factors than is atrial fibrillation,” Heffron added. “I feel like lumping them all together was interesting.”\n\nThe authors found that over one-third of the beneficial effect of a faster pace “was due to the fact that walking faster reduces cholesterol, glucose and blood pressure and makes you less likely to put on weight,” Pell said, noting that those reductions lower your risk of heart rate abnormalities.\n\nThough a brisk pace seems to be better than a slow pace, “the first step is literally a step,” Gulati said. “Walking slow is how we start, but the more you do it, the faster your pace will become.”', 'The relationship between walking and heart speeds', 'Updated 11:08 AM EDT, Thu April 17, 2025', 'walking-faster-may-reduce-your-risk-of-abnormal-heart-rhythms-study-finds-1745808523'),

Sound familiar?\n\nI didn’t always worry so much, but life has a funny way of piling on the pressures as we get older and take on more responsibilities. While my family is not in crisis now, it has gotten harder to manage this stress.\n\nBecause my specialty is urology, I also care about what acute and chronic stress are doing to your bladder and hormones as well as your overall health.\n\nNote: This is meant to be a general overview. For advice specific to your health, please see your medical provider.\n\nIt helps to distinguish between two types of stress: acute and chronic.\n\nAcute stress is your body’s immediate reaction to a perceived threat. Think about how your heart pounds before a big presentation or how you jump when you hear a loud noise. It’s intense but usually short-lived. Our bodies are built to handle acute stress and typically return to normal afterward.\n\nChronic stress, however, is persistent. It’s the daily weight of ongoing issues, such as financial woes, relationship issues, work pressures or health concerns. Unlike acute stress, chronic stress keeps you in a constant state of high alert — chipping away at your health, often without you noticing.\n\nWhen you are stressed, your body launches a carefully coordinated response known as the fight-or-flight reaction. It all begins in the hypothalamus, the brain’s command center, which activates two parallel systems in your adrenal glands: the sympathetic nervous system and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal, or HPA, axis.\n\nThe sympathetic nervous system triggers the release of adrenaline, which primes your body to act quickly. This fast-acting hormone increases your heart rate and blood pressure, opens up your airways, heightens your senses and sends more blood to your muscles.\n\nCortisol is released a little later through the HPA axis. Unlike adrenaline’s quick action, cortisol plays a longer-term role in helping the body cope with sustained stress. Cortisol increases blood sugar, enhances the brain’s focus and memory, and puts things such as digestion, fertility and immunity on the back burner — because in a crisis, your body is focused on survival.\n\nWorking together, adrenaline and cortisol seamlessly help the body cope with short-term threats. However, if stress becomes chronic, elevated cortisol levels can lead to fatigue, sleep problems, weight gain and other health issues.\n\nFor me, this response kicks in during intense moments in surgery — such as seeing an unexpected gush of bleeding. Instead of fleeing (which would be frowned upon in the operating room), my body shifts into fight mode: I zero in on the bleeding vessel, focus sharply and act swiftly to get things under control.\n\nIn such high-stakes moments, the stress response is not just helpful but essential. But when the triggers are constant — unpaid bills or work deadlines — your body can get stuck in that heightened state.\n\nOver time, consistently high cortisol levels disrupt your immune system, impair metabolism, affect mood regulation and even contribute to chronic inflammation — all of which can increase the risk of long-term health issues.\n\nHave you ever noticed how anxiety makes you suddenly need the bathroom — especially right before a big speech or meeting? I experience this firsthand before every speech or live TV appearance: Without fail, my bladder goes into overdrive, and I find myself desperately looking for the nearest restroom.\n\nStress directly affects bladder control by overstimulating the nerves responsible for regulating bladder function, leading to increased urgency, more frequent trips to the bathroom and even occasional leaking.\n\nMy most memorable (and embarrassing) bladder moment was just before delivering a TEDx talk. There I was, backstage with two microphones strapped on, hair and makeup flawless, counting down the final two minutes before going live. Then suddenly — my bladder called.\n\nWith no time to spare, I sprinted to the bathroom. I was still there when they announced my name. I bolted back out, breathless, laughing awkwardly as I stepped onto the stage. I played it off as a joke then, but deep down I knew my bladder was reacting to stress.\n\nResearch has consistently linked higher stress and anxiety levels with overactive bladder symptoms. Your bladder doesn’t just respond to how much fluid you’ve had to drink; it also reacts dramatically to your mental state.\n\nChronic stress is no friend to your sex life. When your body is constantly flooded with stress hormones such as cortisol, it throws your natural hormonal balance out of sync — significantly reducing levels of testosterone in men and estrogen in women.\n\nAs stress hormones rise, sex hormones fall. The result? Lower libido, erectile dysfunction in men, difficulties with arousal in women, and trouble reaching orgasm for everyone. Studies have highlighted psychological stress as one of the leading causes of sexual dysfunction among otherwise healthy adults, emphasizing just how deep the mind and body are connected when it comes to sexual health.\n\nBut hormones aren’t the only factor. Chronic stress can also affect blood flow, which is vital for sexual response. And when stress disrupts your sleep, it further compounds the problem since sleep is essential for healthy hormone production and sexual functioning.\n\nThe emotional toll is equally significant. When you’re stressed, intimacy and connection often take a back seat as your mind becomes occupied with worries. Over time, this pattern can strain relationships, further dampening sexual desire.\n\nIf you’ve noticed stress affecting intimacy, remember it’s not “all in your head.” It’s a super complex hormonal, physical and emotional response — one you can address by taking steps to reduce stress and prioritize relaxation, intimacy and self-care.\n\nChronic stress can also hijack your sleep. High cortisol levels and persistent anxiety prevent deep, restorative sleep, leaving you feeling exhausted even after a full night in bed. Poor sleep then elevates stress levels further, creating a frustrating, self-perpetuating cycle that can profoundly affect your health.\n\nI experienced this firsthand last year. I went through a period of terrible sleep — tossing, turning, waking frequently and never feeling truly rested. I started gaining weight rapidly, and despite dedicated workouts, I didn’t see progress in the gym. I felt sluggish, drained and defeated.\n\nEventually, I had to acknowledge that my poor sleep, driven by chronic stress, was the real culprit.\n\nBeyond affecting sleep, chronic stress is a powerful trigger for numerous serious health conditions. Sustained exposure to cortisol and other stress hormones promotes inflammation, suppresses immune function and creates conditions in the body that set the stage for disease.\n\nChronic stress has been directly linked to an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases such as high blood pressure, heart attacks and strokes. The American Heart Association emphasizes that stress not only directly raises blood pressure but also indirectly contributes to unhealthy habits, including smoking, poor diet and sedentary lifestyles.\n\nAt one point, chronic stress started causing me frequent heart palpitations. Initially, I blamed caffeine, lack of sleep due to being on call and general fatigue. When I finally saw a cardiologist and underwent extensive testing, my diagnosis was stress. I was stunned. I am a physician accustomed to diagnosing others, yet chronic stress had quietly compromised my own heart health.\n\nThe risks associated with stress don’t end at your heart. Research suggests chronic stress might even accelerate cancer progression by impairing your body’s immune defenses and creating conditions that encourage cancer cell growth. Chronic stress also increases the risk for metabolic disorders such as obesity and diabetes as well as mental health conditions such as anxiety and depression.\n\nMy own experiences served as a powerful wake-up call: Stress was not a minor inconvenience — it was a genuine threat to my overall health. Recognizing and addressing it through targeted stress-management strategies isn’t just good advice — it could literally save your life.\n\nWhile stress is unavoidable, understanding how it affects your bladder, sexual health, hormones, sleep and overall well-being gives you the power to recognize and manage it before it takes control.\n\nTo be clear, not all stress is harmful. Acute stress can even motivate you, helping you tackle challenges head-on. But chronic stress — the kind that builds quietly from daily pressures such as financial worries or family concerns — is what slowly chips away at your health, often going unnoticed until symptoms become impossible to ignore.\n\nSo, the next time you catch yourself anxiously refreshing your retirement portfolio or losing sleep over your kids’ futures, take a moment. Step away. Stretch. Take a short walk. Or just breathe. These small acts can lower stress levels, reset your nervous system and protect your long-term health.

But in many cases, knee pain isn’t about the knees at all — it’s about what’s happening above them.\n\nTight hips, especially when combined with weakness or poor control, can alter how your legs move, forcing your knees to compensate in ways they’re not designed to. Over time, this added stress leads to chronic discomfort and, in some cases, serious injury.\n\nUnderstanding the hip-knee connection is the first step toward relieving that pain and moving better.\n\nThe hip is a ball-and-socket joint, built for mobility in multiple directions. The knee, on the other hand, is a hinge joint that primarily moves forward and back. When your hips don’t move as they should — whether due to stiffness, weakness or a lack of pelvic control — your knees pick up the slack during activities such as walking, running, squatting or climbing stairs.\n\nFor example, when the muscles on the outside of your hips aren’t keeping your hips aligned and providing lateral stability, your femur (thigh bone) can collapse inward, placing extra stress on the inside of your knee.\n\nWhen your pelvis isn’t moving properly because it’s restricted or imbalanced, it affects how your thigh bone aligns with your shin. That type of pelvic problem causes the kneecap to shift off-center as it moves, rubbing against the cartilage beneath it.\n\nThe altered alignment resulting from these two issues causes significant stress and uneven wear and tear on the joint, contributing to conditions such as patellofemoral pain syndrome (pain around or under the kneecap ), also known as runner’s knee, and cartilage breakdown that can lead to osteoarthritis and other debilitating issues.\n\nIf you spend most of your day sitting, your hip flexors are likely tight, and your glutes may be underactive and weak. That imbalance can create a domino effect, leading to limited hip extension, poor pelvic alignment and less stability throughout your lower body.\n\nEven athletes aren’t immune. Repetitive motions such as running, cycling or weight lifting without proper mobility work can reinforce asymmetries or restrictions in hip movement. And when your training lacks adequate attention to hip rotation, lateral movement or glute strength, your knees are the ones that suffer.\n\nIf you experience any of the following issues, your hips may be part of the problem:\n\n• Knee pain after sitting or going up stairs: Both situations involve restricted hip movement, forcing your knees to overcompensate.\n\n• Tightness or pulling in the front of your hips or groin: These signs indicate hip flexor restriction, which limits hip extension and shifts stress to your knees.\n\n•﻿ Knee pain during hip stretches like pigeon pose: This issue suggests poor joint mechanics or mobility imbalances that transfer strain to the knee.\n\n• Poor balance or difficulty with single-leg movements: These challenges can stem from weak or unstable hip stabilizers that affect alignment and joint control.\n\n• Knees caving inward when you squat or lunge: A classic sign that your hips — particularly the glutes and deep rotators — aren’t stabilizing properly.\n\nA physical therapist or orthopedic specialist can help you assess your movement patterns more thoroughly, but the following exercises offer a great starting point for addressing hip-related knee pain.\n\nEditor’s note: Check with your doctor before starting a new exercise program.\n\nHere are five targeted strategies you can take as part of your workouts and self-care to restore hip mobility and support better knee mechanics.\n\n1. Release your hip flexors\n\nTight hip flexors limit your ability to extend your hips, which pulls your pelvis forward and increases strain on your knees. Releasing these muscles in multiple planes improves overall hip mobility, which is why my go-to exercise is the three-way hip flexor release.\n\n2. Strengthen inner hip and leg muscles for better alignment\n\nWeak adductors (inner thigh muscles) and glutes can lead to poor alignment of your femur and knee joint. Regularly practicing exercises that strengthen both sets of muscles can correct alignment and reduce lateral knee strain.\n\nTry this variation of the glute bridge:\n\nLie on your back with knees bent and feet flat. Place a yoga block or rolled towel between your knees.\n\nEnsure that your feet are pointed forward and aligned with your hips.\n\nExhale fully as you tuck your tailbone under and lift your hips a few inches.\n\nAvoid lifting too high and arching your back.\n\nHold the lifted position for a few seconds, squeezing the block or towel strongly to engage your inner thighs and glutes, then lower slowly.\n\nInhale when you reach the floor.\n\nRepeat 10 to 12 times for two to three sets.\n\n3. Practice lateral lunges with control and balance\n\nMost people train in the sagittal plane (forward and back) but neglect lateral movement (side to side), which is a key to functional hip mobility. Because your knees are hinge joints not designed to handle lateral forces, it’s important to build strength and control in side-to-side movement through exercises such as lateral lunges.\n\nHow to do a lateral lunge:\n\nInhale as you step to the side with your right foot, pushing your hips back and bending your right knee while keeping your left leg straight.\n\nKeep your chest lifted and your core engaged.\n\nExhale as you push off the right foot to return to standing.\n\nPerform two to three sets of 8 to 10 reps per side.\n\n4. Use soft-tissue techniques to reduce hip tension\n\nFoam rolling or using a massage gun can improve tissue quality and prepare muscles for stretching and mobility work. When hip muscles are extremely tight, jumping straight into mobility work can make it less effective and even aggravate the knees. Spend 30 to 60 seconds rolling or massaging each region in and around the hips — glutes, outer thighs, inner thighs, quads (front, top of leg) and hamstrings (back, top of leg) — before stretching or mobility exercises.\n\n5. Stretch safely to restore full hip mobility\n\nExtreme stretches like pigeon pose may feel good in the hips, but they often place excessive torque on the knees due to the angle and body weight pressing into the joint, especially when hip mobility is limited. Even if you feel flexible in a pose such as pigeon, it’s important to remember that the hip is a 360-degree joint. Overstretching in one direction without addressing other ranges of motion can lead to imbalances. Instead, focus on safe, well-balanced stretches that support functional mobility without putting unnecessary stress on the knees.\n\nI recommend using gentle yet effective supported variations such as a seated figure-four stretch (from a chair, place one ankle on top of the opposite knee) or modified pigeon on a couch or chair (rest one shin on the cushion with your other leg behind you in a kneeling lunge). These options allow you to target hip mobility while protecting your knees.\n\nThe bottom line: Remember, the knees may be where you feel the pain, but the hips are often where the problem starts. By improving your hip mobility, strength and control, you give your knees the support they need to function as intended — pain-free and powerful.', 'Why tight hips strain your knees', 'Published 9:11 AM EDT, Fri April 25, 2025', 'your-tight-hips-are-hurting-your-knees-heres-how-to-fix-them-1745808523'),

Brad Little signed a bill into law that permits the deworming medication to be sold over the counter. Two other states, Arkansas and Tennessee, have passed similar legislation.\n\nI wanted to understand the impetus — and the science — behind the movement to make ivermectin more accessible. What is ivermectin, and what are its approved uses? Why do some people believe that it can be used beyond its approved uses? What are potential harms of taking this medication? And how should someone considering ivermectin approach the decision to use it?\n\nTo help answer these questions, I spoke with CNN wellness expert Dr. Leana Wen. Wen is an emergency physician and adjunct associate professor at George Washington University. She previously was Baltimore’s health commissioner.\n\nCNN: What is ivermectin? What are its approved medical uses?\n\nDr. Leana Wen: Ivermectin is a medication used to treat some parasitic worms. There are two main formulations used in humans. One is a tablet that the US Food and Drug Administration has approved to treat two specific conditions caused by parasitic worms, intestinal strongyloidiasis and onchocerciasis.\n\nStrongyloidiasis occurs when a worm goes in the skin and reproduces in the lungs and intestines. It can cause digestive, respiratory and skin problems; in some people with immunocompromising conditions, it can be life-threatening.\n\nOnchocerciasis, also known as river blindness, is transmitted by repeated bites of infected blackflies that transmit the parasitic worm. In the body, the worm can migrate to multiple organs, including the eye. It can cause vision impairment and eventually blindness; globally, it is the second leading infectious cause of blindness.\n\nIvermectin can also be used as a cream. Some of these topical forms are approved to treat parasites such as head lice and skin conditions such as rosacea.\n\nIvermectin is not only used in humans; it is also commonly used as an antiparasitic agent in animals. In dogs and cats, it is licensed as a preventive medication against heartworm. In larger farm animals, including horses and cattle, ivermectin is used as a broad-spectrum medication to treat parasitic infections. The dose for livestock can be many times the dosage for humans.\n\nCNN: Why do some people believe that it should be taken beyond approved uses?\n\nWen: During the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic, there were a number of medications that had been approved for other purposes that were being studied for their effectiveness against the coronavirus. Ivermectin is not an antiviral medication, but some laboratory studies indicated that high levels of the medication might affect the coronavirus.\n\nThat’s why ivermectin, along with a handful of other generic medications such as the antimalarial drug hydroxychloroquine and the antidepressant fluvoxamine, were studied for their efficacy against Covid-19 in rigorous placebo-controlled, double-blind studies, which are the gold standard for researching drug effectiveness.\n\nIvermectin did not decrease the occurrence of emergency department visits, hospitalizations or deaths associated with Covid-19, according to numerous studies, including several published in The New England Journal of Medicine. Other studies, such as a 2023 report published in JAMA, found no effect in reducing symptom duration or preventing hospitalization, even at higher doses.\n\nDespite these studies, there are individuals, notably some prominent right-wing influencers, who have continued to advocate for ivermectin as a Covid-19 treatment. Some have gone further to recommend that it be used for other diseases, including cancer. Those in favor of making ivermectin over the counter argue that people should not be denied access to what they see as a miracle drug that can cure all kinds of ailments for which the medication is not approved.\n\nCNN: What are potential harms of taking ivermectin?\n\nWen: Like many medications, ivermectin comes with a long list of potential side effects that include difficulty moving muscles, joint pain, swollen lymph nodes, bloody stools, dizziness, sleepiness and unusual weight gain or loss. There are drug interactions with dozens of medications, including blood thinners, cholesterol-lowering drugs and antiviral treatments.\n\nDuring the height of the Covid-19 pandemic, US poison control centers reported seeing increasing cases of ivermectin toxicity, including in people who took veterinary formulations that contained high concentrations of the drug. Symptoms of overdose included neurological and gastrointestinal abnormalities. Two people in New Mexico are reported to have died due to ivermectin overdoses. Federal health officials issued repeated warnings that people should not be purchasing ivermectin intended for animal consumption and that it’s a medication that has not been shown to be effective in treating Covid-19.\n\nCNN: Why are states allowing ivermectin to be sold over the counter?\n\nWen: I think some legislators feel strongly that this medication should be able to be purchased by those who want it, without having to go through the doctor. I have heard some doctors say that they would rather their patients have access to human-dose ivermectin rather than purchasing the formulation intended for animals. Still, this is really quite a departure from how over-the-counter status is determined; in the past, it was federal health authorities, specifically, the FDA, that weigh the scientific evidence and determine whether a medicine is appropriate to be sold over the counter, not on a state-by-state basis by state legislators and governors.\n\nCNN: How should someone considering ivermectin approach their decision?\n\nWen: Even if ivermectin may be able to be obtained without a prescription in some areas, people should keep in mind that this is still a drug like other drugs. As such, it has conditions for which it is useful and beneficial, but it also has downsides. If it is used to treat conditions that it doesn’t work on, the potential harms will outweigh the benefits. Also, if it is used in place of treatments that are actually effective, that could also cause harm.\n\nTo be clear, ivermectin has legitimate — and important — medical uses. Individuals who wish to take it should discuss doing so in consultation with their physician. They should carefully consider the indication for which they are taking it and, as they would for any medication, assess the benefits, risks and alternatives.', '', 'Published 10:04 AM EDT, Thu April 24, 2025', 'ivermectin-is-now-available-over-the-counter-in-some-us-states-what-is-it-used-for-1745808523'),

Researchers analyzed the markers of metabolic syndrome and who developed young-onset dementia between 2009 and the end of 2020, according to the study published Wednesday in the journal Neurology.\n\n“Each component — such as elevated blood pressure, high blood sugar, obesity, abnormal cholesterol levels — is individually linked to higher dementia risk,” said Lee, assistant professor in the department of neurology at Hallym University Sacred Heart Hospital in South Korea.\n\nThe finding suggests an increased risk for much of the US population, as about 1 in 3 adults in the United States have metabolic syndrome, according to the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute.\n\n“Dementia is among our most feared diseases, and developing dementia at an early age is even more worrisome,” said Dr. Richard Isaacson, a preventive neurologist and director of research at the Institute for Neurodegenerative Diseases in Boca Raton, Florida. He was not involved in the new study.\n\n“People of all ages –– from the 20s, 30s, 40s, 50s and beyond –– should be empowered to make brain-healthy choices early on,” Isaacson said. “I think this study gives us more evidence to suggest that these brain-healthy choices may lead to better brain outcomes over time.”\n\nIt is important to note that the study was observational, which means that researchers can’t say that metabolic syndrome caused dementia, only that there was a correlation between the two, Isaacson said.\n\n“I don’t really think that vascular risk factors and metabolic syndrome causes Alzheimer’s disease, but I think it can fast-forward someone towards it,” he said.\n\nMore research will need to be done to determine whether treating metabolic syndrome actually delays the onset of dementia or reduces the number of cases, Isaacson said. Researchers will also need to look into more populations to see if the results from South Korea can be broadly applied.\n\nBut the latest study does give hope that there are actions people can take to combat young-onset dementia, he said. “Some people say young onset-dementia, you can’t do anything about that –– it’s preordained, but I don’t agree with that. These lifestyle factors are nontrivial,” he added.\n\nLee believes people can influence their odds. “My advice is to proactively manage metabolic health by maintaining a balanced diet, regular physical activity, and routine medical check-ups,” he said. “Addressing metabolic syndrome early can substantially reduce the risk of dementia later in life.”\n\nThe conditions that make up metabolic syndrome may not seem immediately connected to dementia risk, but there are a few ways that vascular health can impact cognitive decline, Isaacson said.\n\nMetabolic syndrome can lead to inflammation, and “when someone has inflammation in the body and in the brain, it can fast-forward aging,” Isaacson said. “And when you have inflammation in the brain, things don’t work as well.”\n\nYour blood vessels working efficiently is also important to cognitive health to keep enough oxygen flowing to the brain, he added.\n\nAnd finally, he noted that metabolic syndrome may affect the brain’s ability to metabolize energy, which may lead to cognitive impairment.\n\nThe different conditions that make up metabolic syndrome tend to happen together because they have similar causes and impact one another, he added.\n\n“When a person is physically inactive and has an unhealthy diet … and someone is not sleeping and just kind of burning the candle at both ends … poor activity, low exercise: These are the medical or clinical manifestations of that sort of thing,” Isaacson said. “That’s why these risk factors often flock together — because they really are interrelated.”\n\nBecause both genetic and lifestyle factors contribute to dementia cases, some people can do everything their doctor suggests and still get dementia, Isaacson said. But making healthy lifestyle changes and addressing metabolic syndrome may still prevent or delay dementia in many people, he added.\n\nTreatment for metabolic syndrome, which can also increase the risk of diabetes and cardiovascular conditions, starts with lifestyle changes, said Dr. Pam Taub, a preventive cardiologist and professor of medicine at the University of California San Diego. She was not involved in the research.\n\n“In general, the lifestyle recommendations that we recommend are really having a balanced Mediterranean diet, a diet that is balanced in terms of proteins, carbohydrates, and fiber, and also limiting the amount of calorie intake,” she added.\n\nSome of Taub’s research into metabolic syndrome shows that time-restricted eating can help manage the conditions, she said.\n\nMaintaining regular physical activity is key, though the amount and the proportion of strength, cardio and flexibility training may be specific to you and discussed with your doctor, she said. Getting enough sleep and handling stress are also essential in managing almost every chronic condition, she added.\n\n“Of course, we can’t control the stress that’s thrown at us, but it’s how we modulate our response that is important,” Taub said.\n\nBut lifestyle changes alone may not solve the problem completely, she said. Your doctor may recommend medications to help with blood pressure, blood sugar, insulin resistance, lipid lowering and weight management.\n\n“It’s really not one or the other,” Taub said. “You have to synergize both lifestyle and pharmacology.”', 'Causation vs. correlation', 'Published 4:00 PM EDT, Wed April 23, 2025', 'metabolic-syndrome-is-a-big-risk-factor-for-early-dementia-and-what-you-do-makes-a-difference-study-suggests-1745808523'),

You can’t control the way this is going to go.”\n\nA few days later, she received the call she had been hoping for. On Mother’s Day of that year, the family’s heart surgeon said he’d had found a heart for Addison. Yong was so grateful, but she couldn’t do what she wanted to do: She couldn’t thank the donor directly. Canada’s transplant system, like its United States counterpart, keeps organ donor and transplant recipient ID information private.\n\nAddison is one of the lucky ones, as historically, the need for organs outpaces supply, and patients can languish for years on waiting lists. Nearly 50,000 transplants were performed in the US in 2024; in Canada, almost 3,500 transplants were performed in 2023, and those numbers are climbing in both countries. Currently, just over 100,000 people in the US and nearly 3,500 people in Canada are currently on transplant waiting lists. Many will likely die without the procedure.\n\nA single donor can save up to eight lives, according to the United Network for Organ Sharing. But even when a transplant is successful, there’s no guarantee that a donor’s family and transplant recipient will meet, let alone maintain a relationship. National statistics on how many families of organ donors connect with their transplant recipients are hard to pin down in both the US and Canada, and the estimates are low. Hilary Kleine, vice president of communications and registry for Donate Life America, a national organ donation advocacy organization, said her organization is collecting this data.\n\nIn the US, some local organ procurement organizations that help to recover organs keep that kind of data, like Donor Network West in California and Nevada and LiveOnNY in New York. In Canada, some organ donation organizations, such as BC Transplant in Vancouver, where Yong works, have a direct contact program that “allows recipients and donor family members to move beyond anonymous communication.”\n\nSeveral organ donation experts, including Dr. Nick Murphy, an organ donation ethics researcher at Western University in London, Ontario, say that some donors and transplant recipients also connect independently online .\n\n“It was something I always knew — that if I could meet the donor family, I would want to,” Elaine Yong said.\n\nShe had not been private about the journey — she had been blogging about Addison’s transplant to keep friends and family updated. After about a year, she sent a thank-you letter to the donor family through her transplant center, knowing some donors choose not to respond.\n\nTo her great surprise, the other mother replied.\n\n“It was the day of Addison’s one-year heart anniversary party,” Yong recalled. “I remember looking at the blog and, like, seeing someone had commented, ‘I’m Addison’s donor mom.’”\n\n“She thought I was fake,” said Felicia Hill, who was 21 and living in Reno, Nevada, when she received Yong’s letter. Hill looked her up online and found her blog.\n\nOne year earlier, her baby girl, Audrey Jade Hope Sullenger, had died of unknown causes just six days after she was born.\n\nWhen Hill agreed to donate Audrey’s organs, Audrey became the youngest organ donor in the state of Nevada that year. Her kidneys went to an adult woman and her heart went to Addison.\n\nYong saw online that Hill had started doing advocacy work and that the dates matched. “I saw that she had the letter that I had sent, and I knew, 100%, this is our donor mom.”\n\nYong also confirmed Hill’s story, noting via email, “(There were) a few people who were involved in the case who provided enough hints that really solidified it.” Over time, she said they started communicating, then became Facebook friends, and in 2013, the two women agreed to meet up with their families in Santa Clara, California, for a Donate Life Walk.\n\nYong brought a stethoscope so Hill could listen to Audrey’s heart in Addison’s chest, and Hill brought Addison a T-shirt commemorating Audrey’s memory.\n\n“I kind of went in there thinking, I’ve got something really precious that belongs to someone else. And like, it’s going be really sad for her. She’s going to be really emotional and thinking about her daughter who’s not here and my daughter’s here,” Yong said. “But it wasn’t like that at all.”\n\n“When I first met her … I just wanted to hug Elaine,” Hill said. “I felt connected immediately knowing that another mother got to raise their child. And that’s what gave me so much happiness.”\n\nHill, now 33, said their initial meeting went well because she’d made peace with Audrey’s death, and she now shares her story to encourage others to consider donating organs at advocacy events.\n\nYong is now 50. She said she was touched by the meeting and it inspired her to become an even stronger advocate for organ donation. In fact, she left a job in journalism to become a communications manager at her local organ donor organization, BC Transplant.\n\nThe two moms say they communicate a few times a year and sometimes speak at conferences together about their transplant experience with Audrey and Addison.\n\nThey consider each other to be family, which now includes Hill’s two children and Addison’s younger sister. Addison refers to Hill as “Auntie Felicia” and sends her medals that she wins in track and swimming competitions. In 2018, Hill traveled to Vancouver to cheer on Addison in an event designed for transplant athletes, called the Canadian Transplant Games.\n\nAt the end of April, both families will celebrate Audrey’s birthday. She would have been 14 on April 30. And Hill plans to be in the stands when Addison competes in the World Transplant Games in Dresden, Germany, this summer.\n\n“It’s just really amazing to see that she (Addison) gets to live her life, and she is her own person,” Hill said.\n\n“I like to say organ donation is like the ultimate act of love,” Yong said. “This is like this most amazing gift that you don’t know where it came from when you’re giving it … you have no control over who it goes to, and you also have no idea what happens to it afterwards.”\n\nIf you’re interested in becoming an organ donor, you can register at your local department of motor vehicles, or DMV, or online at organdonor.gov.\n\nIf you’re an organ donor looking to connect with your transplant recipient or vice versa, your transplant center may be able to help.', 'Thousands are on waiting lists', 'Updated 10:52 AM EDT, Wed April 23, 2025', 'a-3weekold-baby-received-a-heart-transplant-14-years-ago-and-gained-a-donor-mom-1745808523'),

But for other risk factors, such as those tied to cervical cancer, there is room for improvement, according to a new American Cancer Society report.\n\nThe prevalence of people smoking fell from about 14% in 2019 to 11% in 2023, according to the report published Wednesday in the journal Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers & Prevention. Cigarette smoking is known to significantly increase the risk of developing cancer. It’s estimated to cause about 1 out of every 3 cancer deaths in the US.\n\n“These latest findings are encouraging, mainly the reduction in smoking rates and screening for certain cancers, but it’s clear urgent efforts are needed to address lagging cervical cancer prevention,” Dr. Priti Bandi, scientific director of cancer risk factors and screening surveillance research at the American Cancer Society and lead author of the study, said in a news release.\n\nThe prevalence of people being up-to-date on recommended cervical cancer screenings has dropped from 74.8% in 2019 to 73.4% in 2021 among ages 21 to 65, the report found, leaving more women at risk of not detecting disease early. The reported noted that the decrease is alarming as HPV vaccination rates have remained “statistically unchanged” in recent years. In 2023, 61.4% of adolescents ages 13 to 17 were up-to-date for the HPV vaccination series, similar to 61.7% in 2021 and up from 54.2% in 2019.\n\nHPV or human papillomavirus is a group of more than 150 viruses that can cause certain types of cancer. Spread primarily through sexual contact, most cases of HPV clear on their own within two years, but when the infection does not go away, health problems like cancer may occur – which is why preventing these infections with vaccination has been key.\n\nThe new report included data on US adults and their modifiable cancer risk factors in the years during and after the Covid-19 pandemic compared with the years prior to the pandemic. The data came from sources at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, including the CDC’s National Health Interview Survey, the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and the National Immunization Survey-Teen.\n\nIt’s estimated that nearly half – about 40% – of new cancer cases among US adults ages 30 and older could be attributed to preventable risk factors, such as cigarette smoking, excess body weight, an unhealthy diet, not exercising regularly, ultraviolet radiation exposure and cancer-causing infections like HPV.\n\n“Despite historic reductions in smoking levels and improvements in breast and colorectal cancer screenings, including following the COVID-19 pandemic, obesity rates remain high and unchanged, physical activity levels remain suboptimal, and HPV vaccination levels have plateaued since 2021,” the American Cancer Society researchers wrote in the new report. They added that racial disparities in cancer rates and deaths persist as marginalized groups face barriers accessing healthcare.\n\nStaying up-to-date on cancer screenings can further prevent thousands of additional cancer cases and deaths, according to the American Cancer Society.\n\nA separate report released Monday found that the rate of people dying from cancer has stayed on a steady decline in the US from 2001 through 2022. But when it comes to the rate of people being diagnosed with cancer, the incidence rate among men fell from 2001 through 2013 and then stabilized through 2021, while incidence among women increased slightly every year between 2003 and 2021.\n\nThose trends were interrupted in 2020, when cancer incidence rates fell significantly, possibly because of disruptions in cancer screenings and medical care related to the Covid-19 pandemic, according to the Annual Report to the Nation on the Status of Cancer published in the journal Cancer. After 2020, they returned to expected levels.\n\nSustained declines in lung cancer have been a major contributor to the overall improvements in cancer death rates in the US. Fewer people in the US are using tobacco, helping lower incidence and death rates for smoking-related cancers like lung, bladder and larynx, the report said.\n\nHowever, incidence rates are on the rise for several other cancers, including those linked with excess weight, such as pancreas and kidney cancers; uterine, breast and liver cancers among women; and colon and rectal cancers among adolescents and young adults.', '', 'Published 10:01 AM EDT, Wed April 23, 2025', 'cancer-prevention-report-finds-us-smoking-rates-continue-to-fall-but-hpv-vaccination-rates-stall-1745808523'),

She has tremendous appreciation and admiration for the French judicial system and has been treated with great respect by the French authorities.”\n\nThe case — long delayed due to other high-profile trials, among other reasons — is anything but straightforward, with colorful characters and circumstances that seem out of a movie script.\n\nThis, however — like Kardashian’s specialty — is reality.\n\nThe robbers could not have asked for a better blueprint for their heist than Kardashian’s social media trail.\n\nInvestigators say one of the accused, Aomar Ait Khedache, who turns 69 this week, admitted to entering Kardashian’s room to steal jewelry, including her diamond ring.\n\n“The evidence gathered during the investigation designates him as the organizer of these acts, even if he contests this,” investigators wrote in court documents.\n\nDuring interviews with police, Ait Khedache said that everything was laid out perfectly — from her movements around town to the luxury inventory of jewels she carried with her to Paris, according to reporting from Le Monde.\n\n“The case itself was given on the Internet, with everything. The jewelry presented on the Internet, specifying that she was not wearing fake jewelry. That there were no fakes, the times when she came to France … you just had to look on the Internet to know everything, absolutely everything,” he said in a police interview, Le Monde reports.\n\nIndeed, days before the robbery, Kardashian had posted an image showing her massive engagement ring, given to her by her now-ex-husband Kanye West. The ring – like most of the jewelry that was stolen that night – was never recovered by police, with Khedache telling authorities it was in someone’s possession but never resold due to its size and distinct characteristics, reports Le Monde.\n\nThe image, which boasts over 1.4 million “likes” today, is still on the reality star’s Instagram page, despite its connection to this dark chapter of her history.\n\nThe social media post has now also been entered into evidence and will be part of the trial.\n\nKardashian’s penchant for showcasing her wealth was criticized prior to the robbery but became a defense of sorts for both the accused thieves and some of her critics who have all but excused the alleged criminals.\n\nIn 2017, Khedache’s lawyer at the time, Jean-Yves Liénard, told Le Monde in part, “this case shows the state of decay in which we find ourselves, where a young woman who is nothing, neither an artist nor a writer, becomes a global phenomenon whose slightest mishap obsesses the international press.”\n\nEven in the fresh aftermath of the incident, late former Chanel creative director Karl Lagerfeld was among those who joined the chorus of the critical.\n\n“You cannot display your wealth and then be surprised that some people want to share it with you,” he told international news reporters days after the robbery.\n\nJournalist Patricia Tourancheau provided some context on the backlash.\n\n“In France, it’s still very badly perceived when people flaunt their wealth so much, and what was heavily criticized, for example, is Kim Kardashian’s selfie (with the ring). So they knew she had her jewelry on her, but she’s showing off, and her way of exhibiting her wealth in France is quite insufferable,” she recently told CNN’s Saskya Vandoorne.\n\nYunice Abbas, who authorities allege was one of the five people who entered the hotel on the night of the heist, has not minced words about his feelings about his involvement. He even wrote a book about the incident called “J’ai séquestré Kim Kardashian,” which translates to “I kidnapped Kim Kardashian.”\n\n“Since she was throwing money away, I was there to collect it, and that was that,” Abbas, now in his early 70s, told Vice in 2022. “Guilty? No, I don’t care. I don’t care.”\n\nAbbas has downplayed the crime and has blamed Kardashian in interviews with multiple media for flaunting her jewelry.\n\nHe has promoted his book on French television.\n\n“I have neither contempt nor a desire for revenge,” he told i24 news. “I am very happy for her. I ask her to forgive me. If she can’t, too bad, I will live with it.”\n\nPolice say he admitted taking part in the armed robbery, and to unlawful confinement, but denies participating in planning of the caper.\n\nHe was released from pre-trial detention in 2022 for health reasons.\n\nTime has also revealed a surprising public reaction to the criminals, Tourancheau explained.\n\n“I think there’s a part of the public that actually feels some sympathy for them,” she said. “They targeted a person, yes, but to steal valuables – money, jewelry – not to cause harm for harm’s sake.”\n\nKardashian’s first comments about the robbery wouldn’t be made public until a trailer for her reality show was released in January the next year, months after the theft.\n\nIn the episode itself, which aired in March 2017, she spoke about the robbery in detail, describing how she thought at the time that she was going to be raped and killed.\n\n“Then (one of the armed men) duct tapes my face, my mouth, to get me to not yell or anything and then he grabs my legs and I wasn’t, I had no clothes on under (my robe) and he pulled me towards him at the front of the bed and I thought, ‘Okay, this is the moment. They are going to rape me.’” Kardashian tearfully recalled. “And I fully mentally prepped myself and then he didn’t, and he duct-taped my legs together.”\n\nShe added: “Then they had the gun up to me and I just knew that was the moment they are just totally going to shoot me in the head. I just prayed Kourtney (Kardashian, her elder sister) was going to have a normal life after she sees my dead body on the bed.”\n\nKardashian cooperated with the authorities on the scene. According to court documents translated from French, she had samples taken from her wrists, hair, and ankles.\n\nDNA evidence, as well as CCTV footage, helped tie some of the accused to the crime, according to the French charging documents.\n\nIn the aftermath of the robbery, Kardashian has said she changed her approach to social media, speaking multiple times about her new aversion to posting locations and other sensitive information in real-time.\n\n“I was just really scared of everything,” she told David Letterman of her feelings following the crime, as she recounted how the gun-toting robbers forced her to hand over her $4M engagement ring. “They kept on saying, ‘the ring, the ring,’” she said.\n\n“I can’t sleep at night unless there’s half a dozen security guards at my house, and that has just become my reality.”\n\nShe also said the incident changed her priorities.\n\n“I was definitely materialistic before,” she told Ellen DeGeneres in 2017. “Not that there’s anything bad with having things and working to get those things – I’m really proud of everyone around me that’s successful…But I’m not here to show off the way I used to. It’s just not who I am anymore. I just don’t care about that stuff anymore. I really don’t.”\n\nThat statement has followed Kardashian in the time since.\n\nIn a July 2024 episode of her family’s Hulu reality program, Kardashian and her sister Khloé traveled to India to attend the lavish wedding of Anant Ambani, the son of Asia’s wealthiest man. Their trip full of elaborate costume changes for the multi-day celebration culminated with one evening look that had Kardashian wearing millions of dollars worth of jewels and making a video for social media about it in the car on the way to the event.\n\nThe show made light of the hypocrisy, with Kardashian sharing that a family member had sent her a meme that called back to her statements on DeGeneres’ show and juxtaposed them with some of her recent diamond-adorned social media posts.\n\n“Lorraine Schwartz made this for the wedding tonight,” she said at one point as she recorded in the backseat, running her hand against the heavy diamond nose chain crafted by the famed jewelry designer she’d just name-checked. “How insane.”\n\nAn apt word, perhaps, for the entire tale itself.', '‘I was there to collect’', 'Updated 3:48 PM EDT, Sun April 27, 2025', 'kim-kardashian-expected-to-testify-about-violent-2016-paris-robbery-as-alleged-grandpa-gang-faces-trial-1745808637');

His new status robbed Joe of the anonymity he enjoyed in the past but did nothing to take away his killer instincts.\n\nAfter a harrowing fight with his love interest du jour Bronte (Madeline Brewer), which resulted, in part, in her ironically shooting Joe in his netherregion and him becoming an internet meme, Joe was arrested and later charged with the murder of Guinevere Beck (Elizabeth Lail) and Love Quinn (Victoria Pedretti).\n\nHe was sentenced to prison for the rest of his life, finding himself confined to a cage much like the one he kept many of his victims in throughout the series.\n\nDuring the show’s final scene, Joe sat in his jail cell and read a piece of mail he received from a woman he described as a “fan.”\n\n“Why am I in a cage when these crazies write me all the depraved things they want me to do to them,” Goldberg’s inner monologue asked in the final scene. “Maybe the problem isn’t me. Maybe, it’s you.”\n\nThe fan’s letter was an opportunity to “indict” the show’s audience, according to Lo, who said the point of this final scene was “to show that Joe doesn’t take responsibility for any of his actions and he has to keep blaming people.”\n\n“If it’s not the women, it’s society,” Lo added. “It sort of opens up the lens at the very end of the show and turns a mirror on all of us.”\n\nIn terms of Joe being even more of a monster this season than he has been in the past, this was something that Foley, Lo and Badgley, who also served as an executive producer on the series, were all very much aligned on. Badgley usually takes an active role in helping craft his character’s journey each season, according to Lo and Foley, and he had some ideas of his own for Season 5, including having Joe be shirtless in the mud and the rain in the final episode’s showdown with Bronte.\n\n“That was very much him saying, ‘I need the world to see him at his worst, most horrific as an animal in the woods.’ That was really important to him, like, please pull no punches,” Foley said of Badgley’s requests. “All those things that we don’t want to see in Joe, let’s show those things.”\n\nUltimately, several of Joe’s victims, dead or alive, wound up having a voice throughout Season 5, including Marianne (Tati Gabrielle), who returns to help Kate and a now-freed Nadia (Amy-Leigh Hickman) take Joe down. Even Bronte helped give her friend Beck a voice by republishing her book with Joe’s edits and additions removed.\n\nBringing these characters back into the fold, as well as having Joe return to New York and the bookstore where it all began, were integral for Foley and Lo to help close out Joe’s journey.\n\n“It was definitely important to us to give a voice to some of the victims of Joe that had survived,” Lo said. “That’s the beauty of knowing your final season is the final season, is that we could choose which characters really felt like they deserved to have an ending.”', '', 'Published 9:30 AM EDT, Sat April 26, 2025', 'you-brought-joe-goldbergs-story-to-a-fitting-conclusion-the-showrunners-explain-why-he-got-what-he-deserved-1745808637'),

The film depicts the sotto-voce discussions in Vatican corridors and the subtle, behind-the-scenes politicking involved in a process where anyone seen to be campaigning for the position is likely to be ruled out.\n\nBut “Conclave” has faced criticism from some within the church.\n\nBishop Robert Barron, the founder of the Word on Fire Catholic media ministry and one of the most followed Catholics in the world on social media, told his followers on X to “run away from it as fast as you can.” He described it as ticking “practically every woke box” and sending a message that the only way forward for the church is to embrace “the progressive buzz words of diversity, inclusion, indifference to doctrine.”\n\nHe said the film unfairly portrays the church hierarchy as a “hotbed of ambition, corruption and desperate egotism, Conservatives are xenophobic extremists and the liberals are self-important schemers.”\n\nThe movie tries to showcase the battle for the soul of the church that takes place during a papal election, highlighting tensions between progressives and traditionalists, the role (or lack thereof) of women and, in the case of Fiennes’ character, Cardinal Lawrence, a crisis of faith.\n\nFor church-watchers, the big question for the real-life conclave is whether the cardinals choose a pope who continues in the more open mold of the late Pope Francis, or whether forces opposed to his papacy will be able to shift things in an alternative direction.\n\nFor the cardinals, the challenge will be finding a candidate who has a broad enough appeal and the personal credibility to be chosen for the role. While this is a political consideration, in Catholic theology the electors are supposed to be guided by the Holy Spirit.\n\nSteven P. Millies, the director of the Bernardin Center at Catholic Theological Union, a theological college in Chicago, said the movie’s depiction of the process is verified by reports from cardinals that conclaves are an exercise in “careful coalition-building” as they weigh up the church’s future.\n\n“A conclave is a political event in the best sense of politics — it is a thoughtful, even prayerful consideration of a community’s future,” he told CNN last year. “The ‘politicking’ does not deny the involvement of the Holy Spirit (it doesn’t guarantee it either, of course). Whether the Spirit is heeded is up to the cardinals. But the Spirit is present, and the vote-counting is a necessary part of the process.”\n\nTo avoid outside lobbying and ensure cardinals are free to pick who they think is the best man for the job, conclaves take place in strict confidentiality, with participants sequestered away from the world. They are forbidden from speaking to anyone outside of the process, which can take several days, including reading media reports or receiving messages. This aspect is well-represented in the 2024 film.\n\nOnly cardinals below the age of 80 have a vote. They cast them in the Sistine Chapel, in front of the awe-inspiring sight of Michelangelo’s “Last Judgment,” writing their choices on paper ballots that are then burnt after being counted.\n\nRounds of voting continue until one candidate has a two-thirds supermajority. The crowd waiting outside is informed that a pope has been elected when the chimney above the Sistine Chapel billows out white smoke.\n\n“Conclave” works hard to be as realistic as possible. Harris was helped with his novel by the late English cardinal Cormac Murphy O’Connor, who took part in the 2005 and 2013 conclaves, while the screenwriter, Peter Straughan, and the filmmakers were given a private tour of the Sistine Chapel.\n\nThe movie gets many details right. We see cardinals wheeling in their overnight bags as they start the process and scenes of them having a cigarette beforehand. It recreates the rooms in the guesthouse – the Domus Sanctae Marthae – where the cardinals stay during the conclave, with communal meals and buses ferrying them back and forth between voting sessions.\n\nWe are also shown the sealing of the deceased pope’s room and destruction of his ring in the beginning of the movie, the oaths sworn by the cardinals before voting, the use of chemicals to ensure that the correct color of smoke issues from the chimney to indicate the result (black for no decision and white to show a pope has been chosen), and the sweeping of the Sistine Chapel for listening devices.\n\nThere are, however, small things it gets wrong, such as details of how the tables are laid out in the Sistine Chapel and the way cardinals address each other. But the least believable part of the film is its unlikely ending, which we won’t give away here.\n\nTom Reese, a Jesuit priest and church commentator based in Washington, DC, gave CNN this verdict: “(The) acting and production values were great, but the plot twists were bizarre and unbelievable.”\n\nFor Millies, however, the film is not primarily about the final plot twist or even about the processes of choosing a pope. He sees it as a story of one cardinal grappling with his faith, and finding it again – something he describes as “beautiful to watch.”', '', 'Updated 12:22 PM EDT, Sat April 26, 2025', 'how-realistic-is-conclave-the-movie-that-lifts-the-lid-on-how-a-pope-is-elected-1745808638'),

Jordan on the set of \"Sinners.\"', 'Ryan Coogler’s newest film “Sinners” is already generating tons of buzz, and a lot of it has to do with a video shared days before the release.\n\nLast week, Kodak posted a 10-minute video that between YouTube and TikTok has racked up around 1 million views, in which Coogler makes complex topics like aspect ratios, film formats and sound design accessible and fun. He does this largely thanks to how the video uses his latest vampire-crime thriller hybrid “Sinners” as the primary example.\n\nCoogler seems comfortable in professor mode as he talks through the different film formats in the video, while film strips of different sizes and a whiteboard chock full of detailed drawings are displayed behind him. His passion is clear as he starts off with a quick explanation of Super 8mm film, Super 16mm film and some technical terms.\n\nRegarding shooting on actual celluloid – which is increasingly rare in today’s digital and video-centric age – he says, “It’s a format that I fell in love with when I was in film school, so I brought a few film strips here.” The “Black Panther” director also mentions other notable recent movies that were shot on film, including Oscar-winners “Anora” and “The Brutalist.”\n\nAfter making sure everyone is up to speed, Coogler then explains how he and his team shot “Sinners” on two camera systems: Ultra Panavision 70 and IMAX. Ultra Panavision 70 is the widest format available and will crop the screen along the top and bottom, while IMAX is the tallest format and will crop on the left and right sides of the screen, the director says.\n\nCoogler’s latest project draws on his Southern roots and family history to deliver a paranormal tale about two brothers who open a juke joint in their Mississippi hometown. The film is led by Coogler’s longtime collaborator Michael B. Jordan, who plays twin brothers Smoke and Stack.\n\n“Sinners” is only hitting screens nationwide on Friday, but it has already made history. This is the first time that a movie has been shot simultaneously with two different aspect ratios (as described above), and it’s also the first time that a movie has been released combining both, Coogler specified in the Kodak clip. Cinematographer Autumn Durald Arkapaw, who also worked on “Black Panther: Wakanda Forever,” also became the first woman to shoot a theatrical feature film on both 65mm and IMAX.\n\nThe film will therefore be available for viewing in several formats, with some showings shifting between aspect ratios depending on the emotion and intensity of a scene in select theaters – another first.\n\nCoogler hasn’t shot on film since his breakout “Fruitvale Station” from 2013 – which also starred Jordan – and his return to the medium is about more than achieving a shallow depth of field and high resolution, he says in the Kodak video. The filmmaker wanted to create a moving theatrical experience like the ones he experienced in his youth, he said.\n\n“My parents was working class in Oakland, and it was the most affordable way for us to go out and have a good time. I still believe in that,” Coogler said.\n\n“Sinners” opens Friday in theaters nationwide. It’s distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures, which like CNN is owned by Warner Bros. Discovery.', '', 'Updated 3:17 PM EDT, Fri April 18, 2025', 'sinners-director-ryan-coogler-takes-us-to-film-school-in-10-minutes-1745808638'),

Pummelled by the rain, Mr. Darcy (Matthew Macfadyen) — wet hair flopping against his forehead — confesses his adoration to the spunky protagonist Elizabeth Bennet: “I love you, most ardently.”\n\nThose familiar with the story know what happens next. Elizabeth (Keira Knightley) denies him and the two part ways, continuing their strained will-they-won’t-they romance. But in Jane Austen’s original novel, the scene occurs inside, empty of any steady downpours or rolling hills in the background.\n\nAnd, in the novel, devoid of any hints of Mr. Darcy’s true feelings, his proposal comes as a total shock. But in director Joe Wright’s version, there are clues: held breaths, hand flexes and sexual tension thick enough to slice.\n\nThose are just some of the elements that distinguish this version of “Pride and Prejudice” from the original novel. And it’s one of the reasons why this movie has resonated even with those who may not consider themselves fans of Austen.\n\nWright’s “Pride & Prejudice” is back in theaters this week in honor of its 20th anniversary. So we looked back at how, exactly, the film continues to bewitch viewers, body and soul.\n\nWhile “Pride and Prejudice” has been the subject of many miniseries and modern Hallmark-esque takes, Wright’s film is considered only the second faithful film adaptation, alongside the 1940 movie starring Greer Garson and Laurence Olivier.\n\nUntil its premiere 20 years ago, the 1995 BBC miniseries starring Colin Firth as Mr. Darcy was considered the most emblematic visual adaptation. Many Austen fans embrace that version, which, at over five hours long, more strictly follows the novel.\n\nBut as seen in the proposal scene, the liberties Wright takes with the text lends to the appeal of his adaptation.\n\nWhile Devoney Looser, Jane Austen scholar and author of the forthcoming “Wild for Austen,” considers the 1995 BBC miniseries to be her personal favorite adaptation, most of her students prefer the 2005 film, she said. Over the years, she’s come to see its virtues.\n\nWright’s approach to Mr. Darcy is one of the main differentiators. In the original text, and largely in the 1995 version, the character is standoffish and prickly. His feelings are largely hidden, hence why that first proposal comes as such a surprise, Looser said.\n\nMacfadyen’s Darcy is different. While still aloof, he’s more brooding and tortured, and the audience clearly sees the effect Elizabeth’s presence has on him. He’s misunderstood and yearning, more than he is simply detestable. And that makes him desirable, not just to Elizabeth, but to audiences.\n\nWright isn’t the first to make Mr. Darcy’s character attractive to viewers; in fact, this idea of an “attractive Darcy” is found throughout many 20th century adaptations, Looser said. But Wright leans into the romantic tension even more. As viewers, we’re hooked.\n\n“The audience has something to invest emotionally (in),” Looser said. “And, I think in terms of sexual desire in Darcy, visually.”\n\nNote the scene when Elizabeth’s sister Jane (Rosamund Pike) falls ill at Netherfield, where Mr. Darcy and his companions are temporarily staying. When Elizabeth visits, we hear from Carolyn Bingley, off screen, that she appears “positively medieval.”\n\nBut the camera focuses on Mr. Darcy’s sight line, so we don’t see Elizabeth’s muddy dress or her dirty boots. Instead, the camera lingers on her wide eyes and her cascading hair — a stark contrast to the focus in both the book and other adaptations, Looser said. Audiences are allowed a peek into the tense and clumsy feelings Mr. Darcy holds.\n\nAnd take the famous hand flex scene, so well known that distributor Focus Features is now selling T-shirts and hoodies emblazoned with Macfadyen’s outstretched hand. In the scene, Mr. Darcy is helping Elizabeth into her carriage. As she steps in, her hand still in his, he releases her palm, swivels around and strides away, while Elizabeth stares in bewilderment. Then, he flexes his hand as if he’d been shocked — a release of the emotional electricity her touch wrought.\n\nWright gives us that visual insight into Darcy’s mind and his feelings, Looser said, but Austen doesn’t. This tension, built throughout the film, seizes audiences’ attentions and fills even the most seemingly mundane moments with heat.\n\nBut Wright’s “Pride & Prejudice” isn’t just a love story. While many adaptations give a peek inside Darcy’s interior life, Wright extends this lens to all of the characters in the story, said Justin Smith, professor of cinema and television history at De Montfort University in Leicester, England.\n\nTake Elizabeth’s sister Mary (Talulah Riley). When Elizabeth announces her rejection of Mr. Collins’s proposal, Wright’s camera focuses on Mary, whose face fills with a wistful expression.\n\n“It’s almost as if she’s saying, ‘I would say yes if he asked me,’” Smith said, “And a whole back story emerges about her.”\n\nWright’s small windows help all the characters come to life, Smith said, in a way that doesn’t happen in other adaptations. Together, they create a rich world for viewers to fall into. Beyond the romance, Wright’s “Pride & Prejudice” could be a family tale, and who can’t relate to a nagging mom or sibling jealousy?\n\nUpon its release, Wright’s “Pride & Prejudice” was a smash hit, netting more than $121 million worldwide on a $28 million budget and a cast led by two rising stars. The critic Roger Ebert famously gave the film, which went on to be nominated for four Academy Awards, four out of four stars. The soundtrack is filled with a lilting piano and birdsong; the cameras sweep over the rolling hills and lush greenery. Every frame seems like a painting.\n\nBut the rerelease comes at a very different time than the original premiere back in 2005. Movie theaters are in decline, analysts are mourning mid-budget films and romantic dramas aren’t as ubiquitous as they once were. While this context might not subtract from the beauty of the film, audiences today are approaching it with a distinct lens.\n\nPeople flooded theaters to see the 1940 adaptation, which was produced during World War II as part of an effort to boost morale, said Deborah Cartmell, a professor of English at De Montfort University and an adaptations studies expert. Audiences craved that nostalgic look at an England “worth fighting for.”\n\nA similar nostalgia could be at play today, she said.\n\n“Watching it makes you feel really nostalgic for 20 years ago,” Cartmell said. “In these turbulent times, it’s a really reassuring tale to look at and enjoy.”\n\nThere’s also something soothing about watching two people meet and fall in love, not necessarily in the most fairytale way, but in a way that appears natural and true. Today, when much of romance is mediated through dating apps and text messages, watching face-to-face intimacy can also be nostalgic, Smith said.\n\n“Movies remind us of the very tangible and raw nature of emotion and of human intimacy, and of actually getting to know someone in physical spaces,” Smith said. “That may sound far-fetched, but I think we may have a nostalgia for romance and courtship that predates the rituals and conventions of the digital age.”\n\nThe drama of Wright’s “Pride & Prejudice” reminds of this more organic way of meeting someone, getting to know them and tumbling into love. That, Smith said, is worth celebrating.', 'The film strays slightly from Austen’s novel', 'Updated 12:33 PM EDT, Sat April 19, 2025', 'why-the-20yearold-pride-prejudice-film-still-bewitches-audiences-today-1745808638'),

Poehler asked her guest if he snored.\n\n“I do,” Black responded. “I have a CPAP machine”.\n\n“Dude! So do I!” Poehler responded with enthusiasm. The pair high-fived in solidarity and Black said, “CPAP team unite!”\n\n“CPAP” stands for “Continuous Positive Airway Pressure.” The machines are used to as a treatment for sleep apnea that involves the user wearing a mask with airflow that allows for uninterrupted breathing and better sleep.\n\nBlack and Poehler proceeded to share how their CPAP machines have changed their lives.\n\nBlack described his as a “game changer” and he can no longer sleep comfortably without it.\n\n“I can take a nap. Like, I took a nap [during a recent appearance] at ‘SNL’ but to do that I have to kind of go like Elephant Man, where to do that I get so many pillows I’m almost like sitting up.” Black quipped. “If I lay down flat, I might die. I don’t know.”\n\nPoehler shared that she’s used her machine for work.\n\n“I put mine in a movie,” she said. “In ‘Wine Country’ I used my CPAP because I wanted to make sure I never got laid again.”\n\nThat turned into a conversation about how unsexy wearing a mask to bed can be.\n\n“Is this a turn off or a turn on that you have this Darth Vader [mask],” Black joked.\n\n“Right before I go to sleep, I gotta tell you something,” Poehler continued as the two cracked up. “You’re gonna hear it first.

We\'ve built a timeline of the franchise\'s films and series so you can differentiate the Rebellion and the Resistance.', 'The “Star Wars” galaxy is ever-expanding.\n\nSince the franchise jumped to Disney+, fans have gotten new tales of a beloved former Jedi, a kid-friendly pirate series and a widely acclaimed, politically minded look at the origins of galactic rebellion.\n\nThe problem? All the stories take place at different points of time in the galaxy far, far away. “The Mandalorian” is set between the original film trilogy and the latest sequels. “Andor” is a prequel to “Rogue One,” itself a prequel to “A New Hope.” And forthcoming films are set all across the timeline, including one that takes place 25,000 years before we ever met Luke Skywalker.\n\nWorry not, padawans: CNN has laid out a comprehensive timeline of the “Star Wars” canon so you can follow all of the franchise’s time-jumps without getting lost in space.\n\nThese details are pulled from the official “Star Wars” resources “Ultimate Star Wars” and “Star Wars Character Encyclopedia,” as well as a chart of the eras explored throughout the franchise. Omitted from this timeline are anthology series like “Star Wars Visions” and “Tales of the Empire.”\n\nMany “Star Wars” diehards mark the passage of time in the galaxy by the Battle of Yavin, the fateful fight in “A New Hope” in which the first iteration of the Death Star is destroyed. “The Phantom Menace” takes place more than 30 years before this battle. But for “Star Wars” fans who are still working out the differences between the Republic, the Rebellion and the Resistance, we’ll measure in plain old Earth time.\n\nMeant to introduce the origins of the Sith before it was canceled after one season, “The Acolyte” takes place about 100 years before the events of “Phantom Menace.” The series follows Force-sensitive twins both played by Amandla Stenberg, “Squid Game’s” Lee Jung-jae as a Jedi master with a dark past and Manny Jacinto as an oft-sleeveless bad guy.\n\nThe Skywalker saga begins! Anakin Skywalker is around 9 years old when we meet him in the first prequel film. Obi-Wan Kenobi is a Padawan to Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jin, who’s obsessed with young Anakin’s off-the-charts midi-chlorian count. Darth Maul, pupil of Sith double agent Senator Palpatine/Darth Sidious, kills Qui-Gon and is cut in half by Obi-Wan (though he appears in animated series and cameos in “Solo” with mechanical spider legs). Anakin also meets the teenage queen of Naboo, Padmé Amidala, with whom he falls in love.\n\nIf Anakin is 9 when we meet him in ‘The Phantom Menace,” then “Attack of the Clones” takes place around a decade later, according to USA Today. Our hero has grown up into a whiny, troublemaking teenager who tends to break rules (like marrying Padmé, now a galactic senator) and generally irritate his Jedi Master, Obi-Wan, who loves him like a pesky younger brother. The Republic is starting to crumble under the influence of separatists like Count Dooku, a former Jedi turned Sith, and the Republic makes use of a Clone army to keep the galaxy together (for a short while).\n\nThis animated series is mostly set between “Attack of the Clones” and “Revenge of the Sith” (during which about three years pass). This series ends at the same time “Revenge of the Sith” does — fan-favorite heroine Ahsoka Tano leaves the Jedi Order and barely escapes Order 66, the command that turns nearly every clone in the galaxy to Darth Sidious’ side thanks to chips implanted in their skulls.\n\nSo, that Clone Army? Yeah, it didn’t take long for them to turn on the Jedi — about three years after “Attack of the Clones,” or as long as it takes Anakin to grow out his hair. In this dark installment, Sidious executes Order 66 and snuffs out almost all Jedi. Anakin commits to the Dark Side full-time, adopting the moniker Darth Vader. Padmé dies shortly after giving birth to twins, Luke and Leia, who are separated and kept secret from Vader. Palpatine/Sidious is now emperor, and the Empire’s reign begins.\n\nSeveral of Disney’s most recent “Star Wars” series take place in between “Revenge of the Sith” and “A New Hope,” when the Empire runs the galaxy with an iron fist and surviving Jedi live in hiding.\n\nThis animated series takes place in the immediate aftermath of Order 66, impacting nearly every clone except for the members of the “Bad Batch,” rogues whose quirks separate them from the rest of the clones — one is a tech wiz, another is a hulking strongman, yet another is a young girl. Unlike the rest of the clone army, the chips in their brains malfunctioned so they didn’t blindly start murdering Jedi under Sidious’ command – and their individuality makes them targets of the Empire.\n\nWe meet the beloved scoundrel Han Solo as a teen in “Solo,” initially as an orphan trained to pilfer. Thrillist surmised that “Solo” must take place about eight or nine years after “Revenge of the Sith,” since Han is a few years older than Luke and Leia, and would have needed time to develop galaxy-wide infamy. We also, crucially, meet Han’s cape-loving frenemy, Lando Calrissian.\n\nAbout a decade has passed since the events of “Revenge of the Sith”: Luke and Leia are around 10 years old; Darth Vader employs Force-sensitive Inquisitors to hunt Obi-Wan; and our favorite Jedi Master is floundering on Tatooine. Bail Organa tasks Obi-Wan with recovering Leia, his adopted daughter, and the young princess finally meets the Jedi master she’ll call upon at the beginning of “A New Hope.” This reignites Obi-Wan’s hope in the Skywalker children and the future of the galaxy they’ll inherit.\n\nA ragtag team of former Jedi, a Mandalorian native, a rambunctious droid and top-notch pilots make up some of the first members of the fledgling rebellion. Their animated adventures take place about 14 years after the events of the “Clone Wars” series, per Den of Geek, and conclude just before “A New Hope” begins.\n\nThis series introduces the “Rogue One” rebel Cassian Andor when he was still a nonbeliever. But over the course of the first season, setaround five years before “Rogue One,” we witness Andor’s radicalization as he becomes a leader of the rebellion. We also see Mon Mothma use her position as a wealthy senator to cover her secret funding of the rebellion’s efforts.\n\nThe second season of “Andor” will eventually end closer to the events of “Rogue One,” creator Tony Gilroy has said: One year in Andor’s life is meant to pass between each three-episode block of its 12-episode season.\n\nThe action of “Rogue One” takes place in the weeks leading up to “A New Hope.” In it, Jyn Erso, whose father was forced by the Empire to develop the Death Star, joins the Rebellion in an effort to retrieve the plans to eventually destroy the Death Star. Along with Cassian Andor, the droid K-2SO and an Imperial pilot turncoat, Jyn dies but successfully sends the plans to the Rebel fleet. “Rogue One” ends just moments after Darth Vader boards Princess Leia’s ship and the Alderanean adoptee records her fateful message to Obi-Wan, delivered by R2-D2.\n\nThe films that started it all, these three are situated smack-dab in the middle of the Skywalker saga, starring Anakin and Padmé’s kids.\n\nMany “Star Wars” fans believe Luke and Leia are around 19 during “A New Hope,” meaning the film takes place nearly two decades after “Revenge of the Sith.” Luke is called to adventure on Tatooine after the droid R2-D2, formerly part of Luke’s late mother’s Naboo crew, transmits a message for Obi-Wan (or Old Ben, as he’s called by Luke and others). Vader defeats Obi-Wan — or does he? — and the Rebels destroy the Death Star in the Battle of Yavin.\n\nAbout three years after “A New Hope,” per USA Today, Luke begins his Jedi training on Dagobah with a batty old Yoda. Lando double-crosses Han, who winds up frozen in carbonite. And Luke faces off against Darth Vader, during which he loses a hand and learns that the Sith Lord is, in fact, his father. Yikes!\n\nAnd one year after Luke gets his hand sliced off, Leia and Han escape the clutches of Jabba the Hutt. Yoda, at the ripe age of 900, finally dies. Vader kills Sidious and redeems himself shortly before dying and earning Luke’s respect. The film ends on the Forest Moon of Endor, where our heroes (and an army of Ewoks) defeat the Empire once and for all.\n\nAt least three Disney+ series are set in the previously unexplored time period of the post-Empire, pre-First Order galaxy.\n\nWhen we meet Mando and Grogu, the New Republic is technically leading the Galaxy after the Empire’s defeat in the Battle of Endor. But we soon learn how lawless much of the galaxy, particularly the Outer Rim, remains. And while the New Republic’s bureaucratic progress moves at a glacial pace, former imperials are forming a new evil superpower — a fascist government that will eventually become the First Order and take over the galaxy.\n\nThis miniseries about the once-inept bounty hunter flitted back and forth through time, from the period after Boba escaped the Sarlacc pit in “Return of the Jedi” to Din Jarin’s adventures in “The Mandalorian.” It’s also in this series that we see Grogu training with Luke and Ahsoka before abandoning his studies to rejoin his adopted dad. Boba, meanwhile, fills the power vacuum left by Jabba the Hutt.\n\nThis series, which brought beloved animated hero Ahsoka to live action, takes place around the same time as “The Mandalorian,” or about five years after the end of “Return of the Jedi,” according to Rotten Tomatoes. It stars many live-action versions of characters from “Star Wars Rebels,” like Sabine Wren, Ezra Bridger, Hera Syndulla and the feared Grand Admiral Thrawn.\n\nFollowing a group of plucky kids turned accidental pirates who wind up on a ship stuck with Force-sensitive rogue Jude Law, “Skeleton Crew” is also set in the “New Republic” era following the Empire’s defeat. The kids’ home planet, At Attin, is a relic of pre-Vader times, though, and remains hidden from most of the galaxy to protect its treasure (an Old Republic mint, where credits, or “Star Wars” money, are made).\n\nThe final three films in the Skywalker saga (for now, that is) take place in a tighter period of time than its predecessors: According to USA Today, all of them take place within the same year. That means, within that time, Rey connects with the Force, Kylo Ren becomes Supreme Leader, Darth Sidious returns, the First Order is soundly defeated and Han, Luke and Leia die. Phew!\n\nAbout 30 years have passed since the Battle of Endor, per USA Today. Leia, now a general with the Resistance, and Han have a son, Kylo Ren, whom many fans believe is not yet 30 years old when we meet him. According to the “Star Wars Character Encyclopedia,” Rey, an enterprising orphan on the desert planet Jakku, is 19, the same age as Luke in “A New Hope.” After she befriends former stormtrooper Finn and discovers her Force sensitivity, she faces Kylo, who kills his father.\n\n“The Last Jedi” begins moments after the end of “The Force Awakens,” when Rey finds Luke on the island planet Ahch-To and he promptly tosses his lightsaber. He reveals that he took on a teenage Kylo Ren, his nephew, as a tutee. That ended poorly. Kylo absconded with some of Luke’s other pupils and killed the rest, destroying Luke’s hope in the future of the Jedi. Luke dies at the end of the film, Leia leads a small Rebel cell to safety and Kylo kills Snoke, the series’ villainous MacGuffin, to save Rey.\n\nThe final chapter of the Skywalker saga sees the surviving Skywalkers die: Leia passes in peace and Kylo sacrifices himself for Rey. Oh, and the clone of Emperor Palpatine (who somehow returned) dies, too, or so we’re led to believe. Rey, who’s told by the zombified Sith Lord that she’s a Palpatine, too, adopts the Skywalker name.\n\nThere are a few new “Star Wars” films and series confirmed to be in the works. One film covers the dawn of the Jedi, and another will tie up the various storylines started in “The Mandalorian” and “Ahsoka.” (Directors including Taika Waititi are also working on films in the franchise, but we don’t know anything about those yet.) Details are slim, but Lucasfilm has thrown us a few bones.\n\nAnd you thought “The Acolyte” was set long ago. James Mangold, who directed the Oscar-nominated Bob Dylan biopic “A Complete Unknown,” is set to helm a “Star Wars” film set 25,000 years before Luke and Leia came on the scene.\n\nDave Filoni, who created “Ahsoka” and “Star Wars Rebels” and produced “The Mandalorian,” will direct a film that ties up loose ends from the various Disney+ series. This must mean it takes place when they all end, a few years before we meet Rey and the gang from the sequels, right? Finally, Grogu gets his shot on the big screen in May 2026!\n\nRyan Gosling joins the galaxy in a forthcoming film set around five years after “The Rise of Skywalker.” We don’t know much about the film beyond its leading man, title and May 2027 release date, but Gosling has played several Han Solo-esque wisecrackers in his career.\n\nRey returns! Daisy Ridley will reprise her role in an upcoming film that sees her trying to rebuild the Jedi Order about 15 years after “The Rise of Skywalker,” per Variety.

It’s an opportunity to shine the light into a side of the universe that we may not have seen,” Gosling said.\n\nLevy, the director of “Deadpool & Wolverine,” told the crowd the film would have all the “fun of ‘Star Wars’” but it would be done “in ways that are new and original.”\n\n“Because obviously you take on ‘Star Wars,’ you take on something this beloved, it’s intimidating, you’re scared, you’re nervous, you want to get it right. But we have a feeling that with this story, with this collaboration, we can get it right,” he added.\n\nThe “Star Wars” universe has massively expanded since Disney purchased the franchise in 2012, with the company commissioning a sequel trilogy to the original Skywalker storyline as well as a series of spinoff films and series.\n\nBetween 2015 and 2019, Lucasfilm released a new “Star Wars” film each year, including “The Force Awakens,” “The Last Jedi,” and “The Rise of Skywalker,” in the Skywalker series and standalone titles “Rogue One: A Star Wars Story” and “Solo: A Star Wars Story.”\n\nThe franchise has also branched into streaming with titles including “The Mandalorian,” “The Book of Boba Fett,” “Obi-Wan Kenobi,” and “Andor” on Disney+.\n\nThe next movie in the franchise, “The Mandalorian & Grogu,” a spin-off of “The Mandalorian” series, directed by Jon Favreau, will hit cinemas in May 2026.', '', 'Published 3:15 AM EDT, Fri April 18, 2025', 'ryan-gosling-to-star-in-new-star-wars-movie-set-for-2027-1745808638'),

Movie,” this month’s “A Minecraft Movie” seemingly came out of nowhere to score box office gold.\n\nBut no one should have been surprised: video game adaptations are an increasingly vital part of the entertainment market, which some say is set to replace superheroes as “Hollywood’s dominant intellectual property.”\n\nNot all adaptations of popular games are guaranteed success – see last year’s “Borderlands,” in addition to 2022’s “Uncharted” and 2018’s “Tomb Raider” reboot. Critics and fans alike found those movies faltering in their ability to capture the story and magic of the gameplay in their respective source material. But the ones that work, predictably, are set to spawn sequels and new seasons of TV, with new installments set for “Mario,” “Mortal Kombat,” “Sonic the Hedgehog,” “The Angry Birds” and many more. (Bonus: The highly anticipated Season 2 of “The Last of Us” premieres this weekend.)\n\nWhat else is coming down the pike by way of video game adaptations?

Pictures, which produced “Minecraft,” are both part of the same parent company, Warner Bros. Discovery.)\n\n“The Legend of Zelda” (2027)\n\nThe announcement that this storied game franchise – casually referred to as “Zelda” in shorthand – would be coming to theaters in 2027 as a live action film almost broke the internet last month. And for good reason: Zelda games are right up there with Super Mario Bros. in terms of seminal video game source material. The movie will be directed by Wes Ball, who helmed the “Maze Runner” film franchise.\n\n“Until Dawn” (April 25)\n\nAs seen with many titles below like “Five Nights at Freddy’s” and “Silent Hill,” the overlap between video games and horror content is wide and rich, like in this terrifying game-turned-fright flick out later this month. Featuring Odessa A’zion of 2022’s “Hellraiser” reboot, “Until Dawn” follows a group of people caught in a time loop who must survive until daybreak to get out alive. It’s part “Groundhog Day,” part “Cabin in the Woods,” with a little “Thir13en Ghosts” thrown in.\n\n“Five Nights at Freddy’s 2” (December 5)\n\n“Five Nights at Freddy’s” from 2023 successfully cashed in on the popularity of the beloved survival video game that inspired it, giving way to this creepy animatronic horror sequel. The new installment will welcome back Josh Hutcherson, Piper Rubio and “Scream” alum Matthew Lillard, with Mckenna Grace and Wayne Knight (of “Jurassic Park” and “Seinfeld” fame) coming on board as newcomers.\n\n“Return to Silent Hill” (TBA)\n\nThe survival horror puzzle game franchise will return to theaters with “Return to Silent Hill.” Christophe Gans, helmer of the Radha Mitchell-starring “Silent Hill” from 2006, is back to direct the sequel, inspired by the 2001 game “Silent Hill 2.” The movie will follow James Sunderland (Jeremy Irvine) as he is drawn back to the creepy titular town by a letter seemingly from a past love.\n\n“Pokémon: Detective Pikachu” sequel (TBA)\n\nThough not the character’s first foray outside of video games, Pikachu will reportedly grace screens again in a sequel to the live-action “Pokémon: Detective Pikachu” film from 2019 that featured the voice of Ryan Reynolds. A second movie was announced shortly before the first debuted at the box office, however, whether or not the original star-studded cast will return remains unclear.\n\n“God of War Ragnarok” (TBA)\n\nAmazon Studios plans on making the widely-acclaimed fantasy, third-person story game “God of War Ragnarok” into a television series.

On Thursday, the fashion brand presented its first, in Barcelona.', 'Few fashion designers are synonymous with weddings like Vivienne Westwood, whose revolutionary approach — in fashion as well as in life — was fired by her disdain for corruption and injustice, earning her nicknames such as the “high priestess of punk.”\n\nIt’s an ethos that may seem at odds with the conspicuous consumption that the bridal industry is associated with. But Westwood, who died in 2022, was also one of the UK’s most revered style icons, and the designs by the British house she founded in 1971 have long appeared on many a bridal Pinterest board.\n\nThrough the adept use of draping, corsetry and other details that transform the wearer, Vivienne Westwood’s designs are flattering on the figure. What sets it apart from other labels is its signature punk and subversive aesthetics, consequently appealing to brides who crave something different and unique and want to express their individuality.\n\nSinger Miley Cyrus, burlesque dancer and model Dita von Teese and chef and former model Lorraine Pascale are among the celebrities who have worn a Westwood gown for their wedding day. Even WikiLeaks founder and activist Julian Assange and his wife were outfitted by the designer for their wedding, which took place in the high-security Belmarsh prison in London. (Westwood herself was a longtime supporter of Assange and called for his release from custody.)\n\n“People are drawn to Vivienne Westwood because she stands for something,” the brand’s creative director Andreas Kronthaler, and also the late designer’s husband, wrote to CNN in an email. “She stands for women, and for strength, power and courage.” He added: “The Vivienne Westwood bride is a heroine.”\n\nYet, while several brides wearing Vivienne Westwood have been featured in magazines, including Vogue and Elle, perhaps the most memorable example is Carrie Bradshaw (played by Sarah Jessica Parker), who wore a voluminous gown by the label when she was left stilted at the altar in the 2008 “Sex and the City” movie — leading to a dramatic scene in the middle of Manhattan, where she chides her fiancé, Mr. Big, for the humiliation.\n\nOne might imagine that to be the last of Bradshaw’s famous dress — but in an unexpected move, it was revived in the second season of series’ reboot “And Just Like That,” when she sought a last-minute look to wear to what it called the “Met Ball.” She gave the dress an update by accessorizing her look with a matching teal cape, gloves and heels. (The television series and sequel aired on HBO, which shares the same parent company as CNN: Warner Bros. Discovery.)\n\nHoping to capitalize on its renown, Vivienne Westwood staged its first bridal fashion show as part of Barcelona Bridal Fashion Week on Thursday.\n\nStaged at the University of Barcelona and attended by local celebrities including Spanish singer Bad Gyal and Spanish actor Georgina Amorós, 35 new looks — including made-to-order and couture designs — were presented. In true Westwood fashion, these were no ordinary wedding gowns. Several looks veered away from tradition and were not a typical bridal white. There were also shirts, blazers and trousers.\n\n“The collection is a potpourri of past, present and future,” Kronthaler explained. “It’s what we are about. It’s the spirit of the house.”\n\nThe first time that a wedding dress by Vivienne Westwood appeared on the runway was during her Spring-Summer 1992 show, though her history with bridalwear dates back to 1962, when she designed her own wedding dress for her first marriage to Derek Westwood. (They separated in 1965.)\n\nWestwood met Kronthaler in 1988, when she was teaching fashion design at the Vienna School of Applied Art, and when the two wed in 1993, she also designed their wedding looks: identical light grey wool suits with butter-yellow cotton polos.\n\nKronthaler declined to comment on the current size of Vivienne Westwood’s bridal business but said that it was “an important part of the house” as “something Vivienne and I have done since the early 90s.” He continued: “It’s grown over the years, and we’ve cultivated a desire for it, because we offer something particular and special.”\n\nOriginally available as a bespoke service for private clients, Vivienne Westwood’s bridal offering has expanded since 2019 to include made-to-order collections that are sold in its five bridal salons in London, Paris, Milan, New York and Los Angeles. Its ready-to-wear bridal designs are also stocked by retailers globally: On Mytheresa, a mini dress made from crêpe satin costs $4,790, while a full-length gown is priced at $14,350.\n\nToday, Vivienne Westwood competes with a wider spectrum of brands, from emerging designers to established labels, which are looking to cater to Gen Z and Millennial brides looking for a less traditional take on wedding attire. This year, Badgley Mischka and The Atelier by Jimmy Choo were among the high-profile names at Barcelona Bridal Fashion Week, which was the largest edition in its history, and drew around 450 brands and buyers from over 80 countries.\n\nAsked whether Vivienne Westwood plans to stage a bridal fashion show annually, Kronthaler sidesteps the question but said the brand would look to stage a runway in other cities. “We would absolutely love to do a bridal show in New York. I love the city, and I hope we can make it happen very soon.”\n\nFor Kronthaler, his wife’s spirit lives on through the label’s non-conformist approach to bridalwear. He observed that multiple ensembles and multi-use looks are gaining popularity, as brides opt for various outfits that can be worn throughout their wedding day — and beyond. “Perhaps before (people) concentrated on one dress,” he said. “Today, brides love changing into different looks, to metamorphosize into different characters.”\n\nKronthaler continued: “It remains a wonderful thing to spend your life with someone — and I think you establish and celebrate this through what you wear on that special day.”', 'The next big fashion week?', 'Published 4:28 AM EDT, Fri April 25, 2025', 'how-vivienne-westwood-changed-the-way-brides-dress-forever-1745808798');

They were also made available online, where they quickly sold out.\n\nThe brainchild of Hong Kong-born, Netherlands-raised illustrator Kasing Lung, Labubu and fellow creatures from his “The Monsters” series have amassed a loyal following since their founding in 2015. But Labubu’s popularity has spiked over the past year, thanks to celebrity endorsements. Lisa, from K-pop mega group Blackpink, has frequently professed her love of the creature on social media. “Labubu is my baby,” she said in a recent Teen Vogue video.\n\nTitled “Big Into Energy,” the latest drop features six vinyl plush pendants (and one “secret” figurine) representing “emotions” like love, hope and happiness — each made in new colorways.\n\nThe new Labubus cost between $13 and $16 each in various Asian countries. Shortly after their release on Friday, some pendants were being resold for up to $90 on US online resell platform StockX.\n\nAt the CentralWorld shopping mall in Bangkok, dozens of fans lined up before its branch of Pop Mart — Labubu’s licensed distributor — had even opened, despite having pre-registered time slots.\n\nUniversity student Kamolwan Pohfah, 21, said she left home early to reach the store because she couldn’t wait to get her hands on the newest collection. “I have been following Labubu for almost two years now,” she told CNN.\n\n“It was kind of ugly at first sight. But I kept seeing it on social media. And my friends are crazy about it, so I follow them,” she said.\n\nTourist Emily Jong, 27, who was also in line and visiting from Australia, said she tried her luck at the mall hours before she was due to fly home, but left empty-handed. “We tried to line up but we didn’t know we have to register,” she said.\n\nHathairus Mekborisut, 53, bought a box set of six pendants. She decided to keep one, named “luck,” for herself and to resell the rest. She’s been “longing” for a purple one, she said.\n\nAnother reseller who goes by her nickname Mai, and wanted to remain anonymous, led a small group to buy up as many as possible. She said she could make double the retail price by reselling them to customers in other countries.\n\nDespite recently shooting to global fame, Labubu (who is a girl) has been a decade in the making. She first appeared as a side character, often hiding in the background, in a fairy world created by Lung in his three-part picture book series, “The Monsters,” according to Pop Mart, the Chinese toy company licensed to sell Labubu merchandise.\n\nBoasting rabbit-like ears, big round eyes and a mischievous grin, Labubu is “kind-hearted and always wants to help, but often accidentally achieves the opposite,” the company said on its website.\n\nLung, 52, previously told Hong Kong local newspaper Ming Pao that the character was inspired by his childhood, which was filled with Nordic folk tales of elves, trolls and fairies. After moving to the Netherlands as a child, he picked up Dutch through simple picture books.\n\nFans often accessorize their outfits by clipping Labubu plushies onto their clothes or bags (they were even spotted at Paris Fashion Week last month). The figurines are also taken to fan-led meet-ups or posted on online marketplaces, where they are traded and resold.\n\nPop Mart, a Chinese toymaker that has made its mark in a collectibles market traditionally dominated by Japan, has found success in selling Labubus in a blind-box format — which makes contents a mystery until opened, adding to their appeal. “The Monsters” series is its best-selling franchise, and last year generated 3 billion yuan ($410 million) in sales.\n\nVideos of young fans anxiously unboxing the figurines, and erupting into joy — or sometimes disappointment — have flooded social media platforms like TikTok. And celebrities like Rihanna and Blackpink’s Rosé have only added to the hype.\n\nOn Wednesday, Blackpink’s Lisa showed off her new pink and yellow tie-dye furry Labubu, from the latest release, in an Instagram story. She revealed herself as a fan about a year ago, when a photo of the star hugging a large Labubu in a camping costume went viral. Her endorsement is widely credited with fueling the toy’s popularity, particularly in Southeast Asia, which is Pop Mart’s largest — and fastest growing — overseas market. Last year, the Chinese toymaker’s annual revenues in the region grew by 619% to over 2.4 billion yuan ($309 million).\n\nA fan base is also growing in the US, though American buyers will have to pay more for their purchases amid a trade war between China and the US, which has hit most Chinese imports with a 145% tariff. (China retaliated with a 125% tariff.) A blind box from the latest series, which also went on sale in the US on Friday, is priced at $27.99, up from $21.99 for the previous series.\n\nAmong the new Labubus being released is a rare one labeled “Secret,” which buyers have just a 1-in-72- chance of unboxing.\n\n“It’s quite fun. If you do get the secret ones, you do get the dopamine,” said 27-year-old collector Lawrence Yu, who lives in Melbourne, Australia and has so far spent $1,200 Australian dollars ($763) on over two dozen Labubus, ranging from ones found in “blind boxes” to plush toys.\n\nHe recalled arriving ahead of a drop at a local mall, where a new Pop Mart store had opened last October, at 2:30 a.m, before spending 10 hours in line.\n\n“I hope it comes to Melbourne soon,” he said in a video call, referring to the new series, which will not be released in physical stores in Australia until the end of this month.', '', 'Published 6:10 AM EDT, Fri April 25, 2025', 'labubu-the-kind-of-ugly-plush-toy-that-has-taken-the-world-by-storm-1745808798'),

He quickly became known for his simple, often unadorned regalia, in contrast to his predecessor, Pope Benedict XVI, who opted for gem-encrusted pectoral crosses, bright red designer loafers and archaic accessories — among them, a traditional velvet and ermine camauro that caught attention for its resemblance to a Santa hat.\n\nAccolades for Francis’ style soon followed: The Cut declared Francis the world’s “normcore pope” for his “simple, non-frilly” approach to dressing. He also became the first pontiff to land a Rolling Stone cover, and was dubbed by Esquire as 2013’s “Best-Dressed Man.” Not long after came the countless memes and unauthorized Etsy merch, with Francis’ likeness featured on a slew of T-shirts, sweatshirts and mugs in faux ‘90s bootleg designs.\n\n“While Bradley Cooper, Chris Pine, and Joseph Gordon-Levitt have all had banner years, their sartorial choices begin and end on the proverbial red carpet,” wrote Esquire’s Max Berlinger. “Meanwhile, Pope Francis’s sartorial decisions have subtly signaled a new era (and for many, renewed hope) for the Catholic Church.”\n\nThe feature was one of Esquire’s best-performing stories for months, according to Berlinger, who was subsequently invited onto several morning news shows to explain his controversial decision (he declined).\n\n“I just thought it was cool and worth mentioning,” he told CNN in a phone interview. “The Pope before him wore a lot of really ornate, expensive clothing. (Francis) was going to jails and washing the feet of prisoners. I remember thinking that this was part of a bigger shift, and that his clothes were a visual manifestation.”\n\nBefore the 2013 papal conclave, Francis, born Jorge Mario Bergoglio, wasn’t even considered as one of the top three frontrunners for the job. He appeared modest, humble and largely flew under the radar. But it was partly this understated demeanor, which differed so greatly to that of his predecessor, that sparked interest. “As the archbishop of Buenos Aires, Bergoglio had never been an especially gifted public speaker,” wrote Mark Binelli in the Rolling Stone’s cover story. “But now that he’s Pope Francis, his recognizable humanity comes off as positively revolutionary.”\n\nThough Francis’ style was often read as a show of his humility or asceticism, Carol Richardson, an ecclesiastical and art historian at the University of Edinburgh, said that the two popes’ sartorial contrasts represented deeper differences in their views on their roles as head of the Catholic Church.\n\n“Benedict XVI was playing with different periods of time through what he was wearing,” she explained in a video call. “As a traditionalist, (he was) asserting the historical continuity of the papacy.”\n\nBy appearing in early Christian chasubles (a sleeveless outer vestment worn during mass), and Ancient Roman palliums (a cloth band that loops around the neck), he was asserting “an unbroken link” from Jesus to St. Peter, the first pope, and all the way through to Benedict himself, according to Richardson.\n\nFrancis, being the first Jesuit pope, seemed to have different priorities, Richardson said, observing that Jesuits (originally known as the Society of Jesus) tend to “study languages, philosophy, and theology, history, rhetoric — it’s all about the application, the process of being a priest in the world,” she explained. “So there’s a practical application, which comes above any theoretical or historical interest.”\n\nDespite Francis’ minimization of symbolism, his all-white dress did bear meaning. White and red are the primary colors of papal dress, with white representing purity and charity, and red representing compassion and sacrifice.\n\nThere are no papal requirements for footwear color, though socks have traditionally been white or red, too. (Francis wore black; Benedict, crisp white). Black, the color of his shoes, has no official symbolism, though Richardson pointed out that Franciscan friars, who preach poverty and charity, are known to wear black shoes and sandals.\n\n“(They) probably are just the shoes that he would have worn as a priest,” she said.\n\nWhen the AI-generated image of Francis dressed in high-fashion streetwear went viral, the depiction was particularly absurd for a holy leader, let alone one so modest in style. However, Richardson saw a hint of truth as to why the hoax photography resonated with internet users as much as it did.\n\n“Although it was fake, it was still a gentle compliment to a pope who follows tradition… but also the fact that they are priests in the world as it is today,” she said. “(It’s) understanding the past and the present to move into the future.”', 'Practical differences', 'Published 6:01 AM EDT, Thu April 24, 2025', 'how-pope-francis-became-an-unlikely-fashion-icon-1745808798'),

You’ve got 30 kilometers (18.6 miles) or more to do. You’re going to be OK. Your makeup feels nice, and you’ll be running good when you’re out there.”\n\nHumphries is not alone in turning to grooming and beauty routines before a race to feel confident and prepared. London-based healthcare worker Intisar Abdul-Kader took up running in 2014 and has since participated in marathons globally (she completed the Tokyo Marathon in March and is now training for a half marathon in Amsterdam in May).\n\nAbdul-Kader emphasized the importance of skincare and makeup that ideally “will stay on for four hours.” (Her current go-to brands are Merit and Glossier.) “It’s about taking pride in showing up to a race that I’ve prepared for months,” Abdul-Kader told CNN by phone. “I’m not going to show up not looking my best. Feeling good, looking good — that’s outside as well as inside.”\n\nCharlotte Purdue, another UK-based runner, shared a similar sentiment: “It’s like going to work,” she said over a phone call. “You wouldn’t go to work without looking kind-of presentable. So, when you’re on the world stage — if you’re running a major marathon, you could be on TV — you just want to look good.”\n\nFor some runners, beauty can extend beyond simple skincare to more elaborate treatments including tanning, manicures and intricate hairstyling. Sprinter Sha’Carri Richardson is known as not only one of history’s fastest women, but also for the ornately designed nails that has become a core part of her personal style. As she dashed across the track in the women’s 100-meter race at the 2024 Paris Olympics, her long custom acrylics — shipped to her from Brooklyn-based manicurist Angie Aguirre — were visible to all.\n\nElite marathoner Anya Culling’s beauty regime takes place both before and after a run. The latter, which includes “an all-body moisturizer that feels like a massage, or a good hair mask, after my hair has been matted from a track session in the rain,” is vital because “it feels like self-care, which is important after I have pushed my body so hard,” she wrote to CNN over email.\n\nInvesting in beauty prep — such as fake tan, eyebrow dying and gel manicures — ahead of time means that “I don’t have to do it every morning and can get straight up and train,” Culling explained. Among her favored products are the Bondi Sands one-hour express self-tanning foam, Eylure’s permanent eyebrow tint and BIAB nails. “I wouldn’t normally wear makeup for training, but for a race, the E.l.f. power grip primer and setting spray means my makeup doesn’t budge, and then a quick lick of Benefit’s BadGal Bang! mascara makes me feel exactly like the name suggests,” she added.\n\nThe growing significance of beauty in sports marks a shift in athletes’ attitudes. Historically, athletes, particularly female ones, have focused primarily on their performance, with anything else viewed as a distraction, said Andrea Geurin, a professor of sports business at New York University’s Preston Robert Tisch Institute for Global Sport.\n\nThis is, she explained, partly due to a largely male-dominated sports culture, where athletics is characterized by stereotypically masculine qualities, such as strength or competitiveness, resulting in female participation in sports being less appreciated. “Men’s sports have overshadowed women’s sports for so long that women athletes felt like they couldn’t focus on beauty, or on aspects of their femininity, while also being seen as a serious sportsperson,” she said on a call.\n\nAmerican track and field athlete Florence Griffith Joyner (known as Flo Jo) captured the public’s attention in the 1980s, not only for her running prowess while setting 100-meter and 200-meter world records at the 1988 Seoul Olympics, but also for her beauty regime, which included nails around four to six inches long, in bright colors or animal prints. Her fingernails were viewed as “both a source of intrigue and revulsion,” wrote Lynchburg College sport management professor Lindsay Pieper in a 2015 essay. “Because she preferred long, colorful nails, the runner was depicted as abnormal, deviant, and different.”\n\nJoyner’s femininity — or perceived lack thereof — was often the source of controversy: Because of her deep voice and muscled physique, her career was mired by unproven allegations of performance-enhancing drug use. (She consistently passed drug tests during the 1988 games, including 11 tests that year, and an autopsy carried out after her death in 1998 found no conclusive proof of drug use.)\n\nGrappling with body image and stereotypes has long been a point of contention for Culling. “There was always this unspoken idea that if you were a girl who played sports, you either had to sacrifice your femininity or constantly prove that you could still be ‘girly’ enough off the field,” she said. “I remember feeling like I had to make an effort to dress a certain way or wear makeup just to remind people that I was still girly — even though I was just as passionate and competitive as any male counterpart.”\n\n“As a young girl, this sent the message that strength and femininity can’t co-exist, which isn’t true at all,” Culling added. That sentiment, however, appears to be changing as Culling and a new generation of athletes become more comfortable with expressing their authentic selves. “Now, I embrace the fact that I can be competitive and athletic,” she said, adding that “I love the antithesis of being a girly girl who is also running faster than most guys out there.”\n\n“For so many years, it seemed like women weren’t allowed to fully express themselves. Now, we’re seeing this old notion turned on its head (as female athletes) take control and ownership of their image, and it’s actually empowering for them to talk about these other aspects of who they are beyond sports,” observed Geurin. “There’s no longer this contradiction; you can be strong and fast and also feminine.”\n\nFemale participation in running competitions is growing: At the 2024 New York City Marathon, which is regarded as the largest in the world, 24,731 women completed the race — marking the highest number of female participants in its history. Women athletes are also increasingly visible thanks to the amplification of social media platforms, where people share their training journeys and race experiences. On TikTok, there has been a recent flood of videos with tags such as “how to look pretty while running” and “makeup for marathon.”\n\nFor some amateur runners, the sport offers the potential for romance — leading some observers to dub run clubs as “the new dating apps” — which may explain a heightened interest in maintaining one’s appearance and looking good. “I know girls in my run club that have got run club crushes,” laughed Humphries. “Park runs and races are a really good way for people to meet. I think that for a long time, run clubs felt like something for the older generation, but with social media, younger people are (getting more involved).”\n\nHumphries added that the sport has helped her form new friendships: “I have a friend group from my run club. We see each other outside of runs, and when we do go for runs, we message each other beforehand saying, ‘What are you going to wear? Will you have matching socks on today?’ I love that it’s become a way to meet people.”\n\nRising interest in running has also proven attractive for brands. Last summer, beauty label Charlotte Tilbury partnered with Purdue, who counts over 51,500 followers on Instagram and 32,000 on TikTok, on video content showing off the products the runner uses in her routine. “They sent me loads of stuff, and I also got to go to their Covent Garden store (in London) and get a full glam look.” Purdue said.\n\nIn 2024, Maybelline New York became the first-ever cosmetics sponsor of the New York City Marathon. Ahead of the upcoming London Marathon, companies including the self-tanning label Three Warriors and facial brand FaceGym have partnered with athletes and influencers, offering treatments that promote their products and services.\n\n“I think back to the London Marathon in the ‘80s and ‘90s, where people would run in their slops or casual clothes,” James Harknett, global creative artist at Three Warriors, told CNN over a call. “Now, the marathon is like a catwalk, where people are (considered about) what they’re choosing to wear and the skin they’re showing off.” Asked why he is now collaborating with runners, Harknett said he hoped to grow brand awareness and to “educate people and make them feel good in their skin.”\n\nA former avid runner herself, FaceGym founder Inge Theron started offering facial massages, as part of a quick break, to runners taking part in the Los Angeles Marathon about seven years ago. “The marathon (route goes) directly past Sunset Boulevard, where our shop is, and I saw a lot of people running and grinding (their teeth) from the stress,” she recalled. “It creates tension within their jaw.”\n\nTheron continued: “I’m seeing a lot more people get out and participate in (runs) — what’s changed is that instead of going on their own, people are coming together.” But whether people engage in athletics professionally or as a hobby, protective measures need to be taken, she warned. “It’s not just micro injuries that can be caused from the repeat repetition on the ground, but there’s also the sun and other things that can impact your skin and body,” she said.', '‘Looking my best’', 'Published 5:15 AM EDT, Wed April 23, 2025', 'fake-tan-fancy-nails-how-marathons-became-a-catwalk-for-beauty-1745808798'),

The soaring structure was built using “mega columns” to protect against strong winds and earthquakes, while its “walking stick” design was topped by a diamond-shaped atrium containing a swimming pool and observation deck. It was set to contain offices and a five-star hotel on the upper floors, according to architects P&T Group.\n\nBut the project came to a standstill following the 2015 Chinese stock market crash that plunged the future of Hong Kong-based Goldin Properties Holdings into doubt. The real estate developer, whose founder Pan Sutong was once among Hong Kong’s richest businessmen, has since gone into liquidation.\n\nA new construction permit — which reportedly lists a contract value of almost 569 million yuan ($78 million) — suggests the defunct developer’s title may have been dropped from the building’s name, according to state media. It is unclear whether plans for the “supertall” skyscraper’s use remain unchanged. Neither P&T Group nor BGI Engineering Consultants, the state-owned company named on the permit, responded to CNN’s requests for comment.\n\nOver the last decade, the abandoned skyscrapers littering China’s skylines have become emblematic of the country’s real estate woes. In 2020, its housing ministry and National Development and Reform Commission issued guidelines banning new towers over 500 meters (1,640 feet) in height — a move seemingly aimed, in part, at reining in the speculative financing often underpinning skyscraper projects.\n\nOn Monday, China’s Greenland Group announced that work is also resuming on the previously stalled Chengdu Greenland Tower in the southwestern city of Chengdu, local state-owned media reported. Construction of the 468-meter-tall (1,535-foot) skyscraper has been on hold since 2023, after the state-owned developer encountered financial difficulties, according to Reuters.\n\nThe fact that two high-profile projects are resuming at the same time is unlikely to be a coincidence, said Qiao Shitong, a law professor at Duke University School of Law and the author of two books on Chinese real estate.\n\n“The national government has made it clear it wants to stabilize the real estate market,” said Qiao over a video call, adding that it has been encouraging local governments to help “revive” the struggling sector. “It is signaling to the market — (it’s) not only about the skyscrapers themselves.”\n\nAlthough the Tianjin tower’s new financing is yet to be disclosed, Qiao believes the state has offered investment and debt restructuring to help kickstart the project.\n\n“(Supertall skyscrapers) are not necessarily the most efficient projects and they are not necessarily making profits, but they are indicators,” he said. “By having this project revived and completed, the government at least hopes it can increase people’s confidence.”\n\nFor local officials, completing abandoned skyscrapers is also about “the image of the city,” said Fei Chen, a reader in architecture and urban design at the UK’s University of Liverpool. “They don’t want a project to be unfinished and to stay like that, which is an eyesore for everyone.”\n\nChen stressed, however, that the resumption of projects in Tianjin and Chengdu is unlikely to herald a return to the “vanity projects” of recent years.\n\n“The government is conscious that although these (skyscraper) projects have some positive effects on the area, they require too much investment and are not financially or environmentally sustainable… I think the general urban development trend is not changed by the fact that some projects are being resumed. I think it’s more about local government efforts to make their city better.”\n\nDespite economic concerns and tightening regulations, China continues to dominate global skyscraper construction. Of the 133 skyscrapers measuring 200 meters or above completed around the world last year, 91 were in China, according to data from the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat.\n\nChen said that skyscrapers, although expensive to build, are often used by developers as “magnets” for investment in the surrounding area. Goldin Finance 117, for instance, was part of a wider development containing villas, commercial buildings and offices, as well as a convention center, entertainment center and polo club. The fate of these projects is not explicitly outlined in the new construction permit, though it reportedly describes the development of several “commercial corridors.”\n\nBut with sluggish property sales and struggling office occupancy rates across China, the project’s economic viability remains in question, said Qiao. “It’s a huge investment,” he added “And I seriously don’t know who is going to buy or rent this commercial space.”\n\nDuring the decade-long hiatus, Tianjin welcomed another supertall skyscraper — the Tianjin CTF Finance Centre, which at 530 meters (1,739 feet) is currently the world’s eighth tallest completed building. Goldin Finance 117 has meanwhile been surpassed in height by both the twisting Shanghai Tower and the Ping An Finance Centre in Shenzhen, meaning it would now only become the country’s third tallest (and the world’s sixth tallest) skyscraper upon completion.\n\nIt will fall to eighth globally if Saudi Arabia’s kilometer-high Jeddah Tower — on which construction also recently resumed, following a years-long hiatus — and Dubai’s Burj Azizi are both completed later this decade.', '', 'Published 10:15 PM EDT, Thu April 24, 2025', 'construction-of-worlds-tallest-abandoned-skyscraper-to-resume-after-a-decade-1745808798'),

Now it attracts millions of tourists every year', 'https://edition.cnn.com/2025/04/21/style/benidorm-spain-holiday-photography/index.html', '', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/rob8443-edit.jpg?q=w_2000,c_fill', 'Over 12 months, photographer Rob Ball explored the Spanish town of Benidorm with an open mind. His experience is documented in a new photography book.', 'In 1964, 23-year-old Ramon Martinez Martinez left his job as a struggling painter in Madrid, Spain, and journeyed south to Benidorm in search of new opportunities. In the first half of the 20th century, Benidorm was a small seaside town best known for its tuna fish and orange groves, but by the time Martinez arrived, a budding tourism scene was about to take off, providing him and his family with a ticket to a better life.\n\nMartinez bet on a boom, but even he could not have predicted what the formerly quiet fishing town would become. Today, Benidorm is known as the “New York of the Mediterranean,” a tourist metropolis distinctive for its high density of skyscrapers. Gone are the fruit farmers and the fishermen, replaced by millions of visitors from across Spain and Europe.\n\nIn 2023, 2.7 million tourists visited Benidorm — 36 times the size of its permanent population. As notorious as it is popular, Benidorm is seen as both an incredible economic success and a symbol of the uncontrolled juggernaut that is Spain’s tourism industry. It’s also the subject of a new book, “Benidorm,” by British photographer Rob Ball.\n\nSpeaking to CNN over Zoom, Ball explained that he travelled to the Spanish coast “with an open mind,” aiming to depict its “totally unique” landscape and architecture. Having photographed coastal landscapes for 15 years, Ball sees his latest work as “a prequel” to those images — a way of understanding the decline of local tourism as international travel became more affordable to the general public in the 1960s.\n\nClose to a third of visitors to Benidorm are from the United Kingdom. So ubiquitous is the British tourist in Benidorm that the town has become known for its abundance of British pubs, availability of full English breakfasts, and broadcasting of British sports on outdoor screens. Every March, thousands of Brits flock to Benidorm to watch the Cheltenham Festival — a popular horse racing event that takes place in England — on TV.\n\nConsequently, Benidorm divides opinion in the UK, as it does in Spain. For some, it is the perfect holiday destination — hot weather, familiar faces and bars open until the early hours. For others, the town provides the most inauthentic travel experience possible, Benidorm a byword for debauchery and sleaze. Ball chose to focus on the positive aspects of this controversial town — its natural beauty and groups of happy tourists relaxing on the sand.\n\nBenidorm is known by many in the UK as “Blackpool with sun,” referring to a British seaside town popular with domestic tourists, although regarded by some as past its heyday. Depending on who uses it, the moniker can be either complimentary or disparaging.\n\n“I’ve always felt that it’s very easy to demonize the working class for going on holiday and getting (drunk),” said Ball, “but I think actually when you work hard for 50 weeks of the year and you want to go and get (drunk) for two weeks in the summer, then you should be able to.”\n\nBut all this was still to come when Martinez moved from the Spanish capital of Madrid to the humble coastal town of Benidorm.\n\n“Everyone came, as my mother and father did, looking for new opportunities,” said Jaime Martinez Gallinar, Martinez’s son and CEO of the Hoteles Benidorm Group of three four-star hotels, recounting his parents’ story from an office high in the Benidorm sky. “It was pretty much the story of the pioneers of the American West,” he added.\n\nMartinez first found employment painting the hotels that had begun popping up along Benidorm’s coastline. The owners of the new buildings often didn’t have the cash to pay him, so would offer him shares in their businesses, or a couple of apartments in their buildings. As Martinez’s portfolio grew, so did the ambition of the city’s new mayor, Pedro Zaragoza.\n\nZaragoza, who was a personal friend of Martinez, is a legendary figure in the history of Benidorm. The city as it stands today is built according to Zaragoza’s vision — all high-rises, wide boulevards and pristine swimming pools, as out of place on the Spanish coast in the ‘60s as orange groves and fishing nets would have been in downtown Manhattan. “He was a lover of the area, the natural environment and the tourist industry,” said Gallinar, recalling his father’s relationship with the former mayor. “He is like a god for every hotelier here.”\n\nZaragoza, appointed to his position in 1950, saw the untapped economic potential of Benidorm when others did not. He toured Europe promoting his town’s desirable sun and sea, and made the radical decision in 1959 to legalize the wearing of bikinis on his beaches. Faced with excommunication by the Catholic Church, Zaragoza rode his Vespa nine hours to Madrid for an audience with Spanish general Francisco Franco. He returned to Benidorm with the dictator’s full support.\n\nZaragoza’s persistence, and Martinez’s gamble to uproot his family, were massively rewarded in the years that followed. After a major expansion of “package” vacations in the 1960s — all-inclusive trips abroad that made foreign travel, largely within Europe, available to more people — international tourists began to flock to Benidorm in the hundreds of thousands. Other than a blip during the pandemic, which prompted global travel restrictions, tourist numbers have continued to grow, creating new opportunities in Benidorm, its skyscrapers pushing further and further towards the clouds.\n\nThe early days of Benidorm’s architectural development were characterised by, as Ball described, a “total free-for-all approach.” Sandwiched between the mountains and the sea, the only way to house the growing number of tourists was to build upwards. The 21st century brought the two tallest buildings in Spain outside of Madrid: the Gran Hotel Bali, built in 2002, and the Residencial Intempo, completed in 2021 — both located in Benidorm.\n\nOne might expect this continuous development — or the notorious rambunctiousness of its tourist center — to be met with resistance from locals. Yet, while protests against mass-tourism (and the growing issue of rising rents and house prices that come with it) have taken place in recent months across Spain, they’ve not been in Benidorm.\n\n“We love tourists,” Gallinar explained. “During Covid, it was like a ghost town, it was so sad. We discovered how much we depend on the people who come here. It’s not like Barcelona; here, everyone is welcome.”\n\nGallinar is proud of the Benidorm pubs that open until 3 a.m. and seeing the melting pot of Spaniards, Brits, and others from around the world, happily drinking and enjoying the atmosphere of a town unlike any other.\n\n“People think Benidorm is for old people, for British people, for hooligans,” he said. “There is a stereotype that Benidorm is a cheap place. (But) there is a Benidorm that nobody talks about.”\n\nHowever, Gallinar is aware that tourism in Benidorm is threatening to become too big for the landscape, acknowledging that “the challenge now is how to grow with the natural environment. The land is almost used up. Benidorm is almost full all year round. If we keep growing, maybe we will find that we begin to destroy the environment.”\n\nIt’s a concern that will eventually need to be addressed, given that demand for the Benidorm experience shows no sign of waning. If the pristine sea, radiant sunshine and pubs full of British revelers in Ball’s photographs are anything to go by, Benidorm is set to remain a holiday destination that people either love, or love to hate.\n\n“Benidorm,” published by Hoxton Mini Press, is available in the UK now and the US on May 22.', '‘Blackpool with sun’', 'Published 9:25 AM EDT, Mon April 21, 2025', 'it-was-once-a-small-spanish-fishing-town-now-it-attracts-millions-of-tourists-every-year-1745808798');

Christy, meanwhile, was being covertly investigated in 2007 over the theft of several artworks, including a 17th-century etching by Dutch master Rembrandt van Rijn.\n\n“That etching that was my entrée into his ring,” recalled Walker, who recently retired from the FBI after almost 29 years, allowing him to speak more openly about his career exposing fraudsters, forgers and traffickers in elaborate sting operations.\n\n“At the time, I was really hyper-focused on learning about fine art prints,” added the former agent, who met Christy through a confidential source in 2007. “And I made him believe I was the kind of person who could sell a Rembrandt.”\n\nBut things got trickier for Walker, he said, when Christy’s expert accomplice got in touch.\n\n“(Christy) took art off walls, but he wouldn’t necessarily know if it was valuable or not. He would figure that out later on,” Walker told CNN over Zoom. “So, starting off that operation, I was the expert — I knew more than him. But, pretty quickly, the tables turned… the stakes got pretty intense once I found myself going head-to-head with an art dealer.”\n\nAround 18 months earlier, Walker said, Christy had unexpectedly vanished from the FBI’s radar. It transpired he was serving time, for an unrelated theft, at Washington State Corrections Center, court records show. By happenstance, Christy had shared a cell with Kurt Lidtke, a disgraced art dealer whom the FBI said was imprisoned for selling his clients’ works without paying them proceeds. Using the latter’s knowledge of the Seattle art market — namely the whereabouts of some of its most valuable paintings — the two cellmates began plotting an ambitious crime spree, Walker said.\n\n“They were going to hit dozens of collections in the Pacific Northwest to the tune of several hundred million dollars,” he added.\n\nWalker, still masquerading as an art dealer, resumed contact with Christy upon his release from prison. Christy soon carried out a successful burglary, while Lidtke was still in prison, according to court documents. And it wasn’t long before his new co-conspirator called Walker to sell him some paintings — and to sound him out, the former investigator said.\n\n“Fortunately, (Lidtke) thought I was a dealer who specialized primarily in California Impressionists, and he was a dealer who specialized in the Northwest School (a 20th-century art movement),” said Walker, adding that they later “spent a lot of time talking about our respective areas of expertise.”\n\nWalker used his art market knowledge to build rapport with the dealer, he said, and gained the duo’s trust by pretending to sell three of their stolen artworks. He also began gathering information about their next potential victim as the FBI prepared a trap at the target’s home.\n\nEven as authorities appeared to be closing in — Christy was confronted by police while surveilling the property from a parked pickup truck, though he was allowed to leave the scene — Walker believes his performance had been so convincing that Lidtke was oblivious to his involvement until the very end, attributing Christy’s brief encounter with police on bad luck.\n\n“Kurt (Lidtke) didn’t trust his instincts and blame me,” he recalled. “We’d had a long enough, and a solid enough, relationship up to that point that he didn’t listen to that inner voice saying, ‘Well, if only three people in the world knew (about the planned robbery) it must have been (him)’.”\n\nThe FBI averted the burglary and later arrested the pair, according to court documents. Walker said that incriminating recordings he collected during the sting operation helped secure convictions for both Lidtke and Christy, on charges of conspiracy and transportation of stolen goods. In 2011, they were sentenced to four and five-and-a quarter years in prison, respectively.\n\nThe Art Crime Team, and Walker’s involvement with it, dates to the early years of the Iraq War.\n\nAs US troops advanced on Baghdad following the 2003 invasion, looters had plundered an estimated 15,000 artifacts from the country’s National Museum in just 36 hours. At the time, Walker, who had been an FBI agent since 1996, expressed willingness to investigate the thefts. Despite studying business administration and accounting at college, he gravitated toward art history courses and was interested in cases involving cultural heritage.\n\n“I called (FBI) headquarters and said, ‘Hey, if you send a team to Iraq, put me in coach,” he recalled.\n\nUltimately, the FBI did not send him, or any agents, to Baghdad in 2003. But amid widespread criticism of America’s failure to protect Iraq’s cultural property — and realizing a need for experts to track down the items, or to be deployed overseas in future looting incidents — the bureau established a specialist art team the following year.\n\nThanks to his earlier interest and internal reputation for sophisticated undercover operations, Walker was recruited to the unit. He was one of fewer than 10 founding agents who would be trained in the history, vocabulary and, most importantly, business of art. “Within the first year of being on the team, I started taking more advanced level college courses that helped inform my approach to these operations,” Walker recalled.\n\nThe team was focused not only on thefts, from homes, galleries or archeological sites, but also forgery and trafficking rings. Given how many stolen artworks end up on the US market, it also investigated art crimes committed overseas. Today, the unit has more than doubled in size and employs experts in fields including archaeology and anthropology, as well as former art market professionals.\n\nSince its founding in 2004, the Art Crime Team has recovered more than 20,000 items of cultural property, including thousands of items from the National Museum of Iraq (though the FBI estimates that between 7,000 and 10,000 of those remain unaccounted for). This two-decade haul is valued at over $1 billion, which Walker called “an oversized return on investment” for the FBI. And that figure doesn’t include the potential value of seized fakes that could have generated billions of dollars if successfully sold. One of the former agent’s last cases involved a dealer with “about $2 billion in inventory — that was all fake,” he said.\n\nRecent successes speak to the unit’s broad remit. Last year alone, its investigations led to the return of a Revolutionary War-era musket to a Philadelphia museum; the recovery of a pocket watch once owned by Theodore Roosevelt that had been missing since the 1980s; and the repatriation, to Japan, of 22 artifacts looted following the Battle of Okinawa in 1945. One of the team’s most high-profile cases involved a pair of ruby slippers, worn by Judy Garland as Dorothy in “The Wizard of Oz,” that were recovered 13 years after being stolen from a museum in Minnesota.\n\nFor the latter operation, Walker posed as a Hollywood memorabilia authenticator to help lure in a suspect seeking the $1 million reward for the objects’ return, he said. To prepare, he spent time with experts at the Smithsonian’s National Museum of American History (which owns another pair of Garland’s set-worn ruby slippers), to study exactly how they would examine the objects.\n\nBut while there are undercover agents who can be “anything, at any time, in any place,” Walker said, he is not of that mold, despite sometimes running up to five covert operations at a time. For him, it’s all about a level of preparation — sometimes over-preparation — akin to method acting.\n\n“It was understanding what that role should look like, and doing my best to understand that persona,” he said. “But at the end of the day, when you’re in role, the best thing to do is just be yourself. It’s easier to lie when you’re telling the truth.”\n\nIn other words: The more he knew, the more convincing he could be. “I had a lot of cases that involved Warhol, whether thefts or fakes,” Walker offered as an example. “Studying Warhol, and getting a deeper knowledge of his materials, his processes and his compositions helped me in a lot of the undercover operations.”\n\nWalker’s performances also relied on “verbal or visual” cues typical of the professionals he was impersonating. He would sometimes dress the part, too, by wearing the expensive clothes of a high-end dealer or dressing down as the kind of uber-wealthy collector who “has so much money he doesn’t need to care about appearances,” the former agent said.\n\nHe would wear a pair of lucky Bob Ross socks, too. It was, after all, dangerous work.\n\n“There were a few moments where I thought to myself, ‘Oh, this is how it ends,’” he recounted in a subsequent email exchange with CNN, adding: “Every single undercover meeting has the potential to escalate, even when dealing with individuals that don’t have a history of violence. In fact, I think those individuals that have no prior convictions can be more dangerous. They tend to have the most to lose.”\n\nCases come to the Art Crime Team in various ways. Local police may alert the FBI to thefts if the stolen goods cross (or are thought to have crossed) state lines. The bureau also invites the public to provide anonymous tip-offs via its National Stolen Art File, a database containing thousands of missing paintings, sculptures and artifacts with cultural value, from candelabras to ceramics.\n\nUsually, however, missing art only comes to the authorities’ attention when it enters, or re-enters, the market.\n\n“Stealing the artwork is usually the easy part,” Walker said. “It’s selling the artwork that’s the hard part (because) there aren’t too many people in the world — and certainly no reputable art dealers — who want to buy stolen art. Often, the thieves haven’t really thought through how they’re going to sell the artworks.”\n\nThe FBI’s running list of “top 10 art crimes” features various high-profile items that would now be near-impossible to move on the open market. There’s the $3 million Stradivarius violin stolen from a New York City apartment in 1995, and the Pierre-Auguste Renoir painting taken in an armed robbery from a Houston home in 2011. Then there is, in Walker’s view, the holy grail of art crime: The 13 works, including paintings by Rembrandt, Édouard Manet and Edgar Degas, snatched from Boston’s Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in a notorious 1990 heist.\n\n“If you said you had a lead on them tomorrow, in any part of the world, the team would throw every resource they could at (it),” he said of the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum artworks. You might also, he added, end up $10 million richer thanks to the reward offered up by the museum’s board.\n\nArt criminals’ motivations are almost always financial, Walker said. Their downfall often shares a common theme, too, whether it’s trusting an undercover agent or seeking big-money rewards for stolen goods: greed. And while the former agent didn’t see a significant increase in art-related crimes over his two decades investigating them (if there appear to be more media reports, it’s because “we just got better at doing our job”), he believes perpetrators’ scope and abilities grew in that time.\n\n“Twenty years ago, largely, fraud was more of the household names and the dead guys. It was the Rothkos or the Picassos. But now it’s living contemporary artists that are being faked in their lifetime,” he said, adding that technology now allows forgers to operate without conventional artistic skills. “There are printing technologies that can mimic brushstrokes. So, with a small investment and a really good high-resolution camera, you can create fakes today that rival the quality of a (master forger).”\n\nThe threat posed to living artists is now Walker’s main preoccupation. After retiring from the FBI in December, he founded the Art Legacy Institute (ALI), a non-profit helping artists protect their work and livelihoods from fraud. Having spent a career solving crimes, he now hopes to prevent them from happening in the first place.\n\nForgeries come in two guises: either a known work is replicated, or a new composition is created in the artist’s style and positioned as a previously undocumented work. According to Walker, the solution — to the latter, at least — is surprisingly simple: cataloging. ALI is creating a detailed digital archive, stored on its server, that he hopes would become the definitive record of an artist’s output.\n\n“Documenting what you create, as an artist, is the most important thing you can do… There’s been no shortage of artists who grind away for (decades) to finally get recognized for their contribution, for demand to increase, and then all of a sudden, the fraudsters come out,” he said. “They start attacking the style the artists were doing 20 or 30 years earlier that is not well documented — and it’s those gaps (in provenance) that allow the fraudsters to thrive.”\n\nAs for identifying like-for-like replicas? That’s where technology now comes in. Last month, Walker’s organization announced a partnership with optical AI firm Alitheon that can create a unique “digital fingerprint” for any artwork — thousands of data points recording miniscule surface details, invisible to even the greatest forger’s eye.\n\n“It is simple to use and scalable, and it just works,” Walker said, joking: “Even an old, retired FBI agent can use this tech.”', '‘It’s easier to lie when you’re telling the truth’', 'Published 6:00 AM EDT, Sun April 27, 2025', 'forgers-and-fraudsters-trusted-him-for-decades-but-he-was-an-undercover-fbi-art-detective-1745808798'),
(284, 'The latest trend in watches might surprise you', 'https://edition.cnn.com/2025/04/17/style/watches-wonders-unusual-trend/index.html', '', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-1978656556.jpg?q=w_2000,c_fill', 'At the 2024 Grammy Awards, Taylor Swift wore her watch in an unexpected place: around her neck.', 'Set in a sleek, lacquered rectangular casing and adorned with 20 baguette-cut yellow beryls — set in gold, to match the opulent golden chain from which it dangles — Chanel’s latest launch looks like a lipstick at first sight. But there’s more to it. With a click, the lipstick case opens to reveal a watch dial at its center.\n\nNamed “Kiss Me,” the timepiece is part of the French luxury house’s capsule collection, which was unveiled at the Watches and Wonders trade fair in Geneva in April. Fusing beauty and horology, the collection also includes “Protect Me,” an amulet-like pendant that reimagines the evil eye as founder Gabrielle “Coco” Chanel’s own kohl-lined gaze, and “Give Me Luck,” a talismanic necklace featuring rubellite cabochons and five pink tourmalines arranged in a Byzantine motif that Chanel herself loved. Twist either pendant and, again, a hidden watch is revealed.\n\nCreating timepieces that bear little resemblance to ordinary wristwatches (which traditionally feature a dial plate and hands, and attached by a strap, designed to be worn around the wrist) may seem like an unexpected move for Chanel, known for its classic styles. But it’s part of a broader growing trend that has also extended to the red carpet: See the custom Lorraine Schwartz watch choker that Taylor Swift wore around her neck to the Grammy Awards last year.\n\n“It’s a new way to wear time — one that celebrates uniqueness and individuality,” said Manon Hagie, sales director of watches at Sotheby’s, on a phone call with CNN.\n\nTimepieces in unlikely shapes and sizes featured across the Watches and Wonders fair, which concluded on Monday.\n\nVan Cleef & Arpels unveiled a new diamond-studded edition of the Cadenas — a bold, padlock-inspired design with a shackle-like clasp that looks more like a bracelet than a watch — marking the 90th anniversary of one of its most beloved styles. “When you look at it, it’s not immediately clear it’s a watch — and that’s what makes it modern and intriguing,” said Rainer Bernard, head of research and development at Van Cleef & Arpels, attributing the design’s enduring appeal to its dual identity as both a jewel and timepiece.\n\nSimilarly, the diamond-studded open cuff featuring Cartier’s iconic panther — caught mid-leap, paw outstretched, prowling over its prey — may initially look like a daring adornment. Upon closer inspection, however, the feline sits opposite a discreet watch dial that is only revealed when the piece is tilted by the wearer. These newly introduced Panthère jewelry watches — which also include a pared-down version in gold — play on the silhouette of last year’s Réflection de Cartier. (That model featured a mirrored finish in place of the panther, allowing the time to be read through its reflection, as the name subtly suggests.)\n\nCartier’s appetite for no-watch watches also extends to the men’s department with its revival of the Tank à Guichets. Deceptively minimalist, the new model features neither a dial nor hands — just two tiny apertures, or “guichets” (French for ticket windows), showing the hour and minutes as digits at the top and bottom, respectively. First introduced in 1928 as a reinterpretation of the classic Tank, the limited-edition style returns in 2025 in yellow gold, rose gold and platinum.\n\nUnusual-looking timepieces also took center stage at a special Sotheby’s sale in April. Titled Area 51 — a playful nod to the US military site in the Nevada desert, long associated with UFOs and conspiracy theories about alien technology — the auction spotlighted 51 timepieces with uncommon case shapes or made with materials rarely used in watchmaking. Ranging from vintage Patek Philippe models to futuristic creations by independent brands like Urwerk, the lots fetched a combined $1.6 million.\n\nFor Sotheby’s Hagie, the result reflects “how the watch audience is evolving, with more women and Gen Z collectors entering the space.”\n\nCustomers looking for less risqué styles may be drawn to pendant watches. All the rage during the Roaring Twenties, when they swung from the lithe frames of bob-haired flapper girls in fringed dresses and lowered waistlines, the style is enjoying a revival amid newfound interest in unusual watch forms, Hagie observed. She linked the trend to nostalgia, but also watchmakers’ growing focus on female clients and their heterogeneous tastes.\n\nIndeed, in recent years, Jaeger-LeCoultre and even the sportier Richard Mille have introduced watches designed to swing from one’s neck. Meanwhile, Chanel’s playful new take on its signature octagonal-dial Première watch features an extra-long gold and leather chain designed to wrap not only around the wrist but also the neck.\n\nAt Piaget — where pendant watches have long been part of the brand’s repertoire — they’re back in the spotlight: This year, the Swiss watchmaker unveiled a model featuring a rope-like gold chain and ruby-root beads, with a ruby-root dial framed by a festoon of spinels and yellow sapphires arranged as a fan. A more pared-down version highlights a trapeze-shaped dial, the core design element of the newly launched Sixtie collection.\n\nAt Watches and Wonders, they were intentionally displayed next to “patrimony” timepieces from Piaget’s archive that are not for sale, explained Stéphanie Sivrière, the brand’s jewelry and watch artistic director. “We create a fluid narrative where past and present collide — until you forget which is which,” she said, adding that, as of late, pendant watches have “been so successful we can barely keep up with demand.”\n\nAt more accessible price points, Van Cleef & Arpels has reimagined its signature Alhambra, Perlée and Ludo designs as pendant watches featuring juicy colored gems like turquoise, lapis lazuli and carnelian. Meanwhile, Dior’s jewelry division has introduced pendant versions of its Gem Dior watch — one with jazzy malachite, the other with delicate aragonite — dangling from a thread-thin link-bar chain. “I love the idea of jewelry that tells time,” Victoire de Castellane, Dior Joaillerie’s creative director, wrote to CNN over email. “And I find wearing a watch as a pendant amusing.”\n\nA lighthearted approach was also taken by Philippe Delhotal, creative director of Hermès Horloger, who turned the house’s iconic anchor chain motif into a brooch watch, rimmed with diamonds and adorned with a pink tourmaline, as part of the Maillon Libre collection unveiled at the fair.\n\n“Historically, watches have also been carried in pockets, worn on ties or styled as brooches. So rather than designing a brooch to hold a watch, we first created the watch itself — then the idea of the brooch came naturally,” Delhotal explained. “It’s a nomadic piece that can be shared or styled differently — pinned as a brooch or worn as a pendant on a sautoir. In doing so, it offers the wearer a spectrum of possibilities.”', '‘It’s not immediately clear it’s a watch’', 'Published 5:19 AM EDT, Thu April 17, 2025', 'the-latest-trend-in-watches-might-surprise-you-1745808798'),

The 40-year-old Ghanaian painter is about to open his first London show, “I Do Not Come to You by Chance,” at a UK outpost of the American mega-gallery, Gagosian.\n\nIt’s an exhibition showcasing a new body of figurative paintings –– joyful, empowering portrayals of Black men and women, wrought in his distinctive lionized style and pairing fingertip-painting with paper-transferred patterns and blocks of color. In one, a woman stands, hands on hips, draped in white lace; another depicts Boafo himself, on a bicycle, clad in gold chains and chintz. Eshewing a conventional “white-cube” gallery setting, sections of the space are covered in patterned wallpaper. More strikingly, one room is filled with a life-size recreation of the courtyard at Boafo’s childhood home in Ghana’s capital, Accra.\n\n“The idea of bringing the courtyard situation to London is me bringing home with me,” said Boafo over Zoom. “The courtyard is a space where I got to learn about almost everything: how to take a bath, how to take care of yourself,; how to sit quietly and listen, how to be disciplined.”\n\nBoafo’s rise to art-world stardom has been swift and significant. In 2018, as he was finishing a Master of Fine Arts degree at the Academy of Fine Arts Vienna in Austria, American artist Kehinde Wiley found his art on Instagram. “He suggested my work to his galleries,” said Boafo, “which was when things started picking up.” By December 2021, one of his paintings, “Hands Up,” had sold for over 26 million Hong Kong dollars ($3.4 mililon) at Christie’s, setting an auction record for his work.\n\nAlong the way, there was a residency at the Rubell Museum in Miami, owned by renowned collectors Don and Mera Rubell. Boafo signed with galleries in Los Angeles (Roberts Projects) and Chicago (Mariane Ibrahim). “Then Dior happened,” he said, referencing his collaboration with the French fashion house on its Spring-/Summer 2021 menswear collection, “and it didn’t slow down.” Three of Boafo’s paintings were even sent into space –– on exterior panels of a Blue Origin rocket. “I realized that maybe (my career is) never going to slow down –– and it never did.”\n\nBoafo was born in Accra in 1984; his father died when he was young and he was raised by his mother, who worked as home help, cooking and cleaning for different families. He developed a childhood love of art. “It was one of the ways that kids in the community got together: to draw,” he recalled. “I had always wanted to go to art school but, because of financial difficulties, I did not manage to.” Instead, Boafo ended up on the tennis court and played semi-professionally for several years, until a man Boafo’s mother worked for offered to pay his first tuition fees for Ghanatta College of Art and Design in Accra.\n\nThe four-year course taught him to draw and to paint. But he also took lessons from the tennis court: “not to sit idle; whatever happens, you move,” said Boafo. He moved to Vienna, went back to school and developed the painterly “language” that has since made global waves.\n\n“He was confronting the ideology that art history has to be within a Eurocentric form,” said French-Somali gallerist Mariane Ibrahim, who supports emerging artists of African descent across galleries in Chicago, Mexico and Paris. “To purposely deconstruct traditional portraiture and figuration was really an act of rebellion, but also an act of making and creating your own history. I felt a connection in our experiences: being away from home in a place that doesn’t have much of an African- diaspora community.”\n\nToday Boafo sits front and center of an art-world reappreciation of Black figuration. “He’s the head of a locomotive of a new generation of painters from West Africa and beyond,” said Ibrahim. The subjects of his paintings are his friends and family, and, frequently, himself, because, Boafo said, “I don’t see why I should not be present when I am representing my people.”\n\nThe paintings are a visual representation of Boafo’s desire to slow down and take stock. He hopes to work on one more exhibition with a similar theme in a different location –– “and then I will step away from making paintings for shows,” he said, continuing to explain that “I want to take a bit of break because I have other projects that I am passionate about –– like architecture and tennis. I want to build my own tennis academy, to develop (sports initiatives) so that the youth have something to do.”\n\nAt Gagosian in London, the new self-portraits –– including one of his largest paintings to date, in which Boafo reclines on a bed, swathed in floral patterns and surrounded by plants –– have an added poignancy. They act as “a reminder of the things that I want to do,” he said. “It’s a reminder to take a break and do yoga. Take a break and go on a bike ride. Take a break and look pretty and beautiful. Take a break and, sometimes, just stay home and relax.”\n\nWith his work now held in major museum collections, from London’s Tate and the Fondation Louis Vuitton in Paris to New York’s Guggenheim and the Hirshhorn in Washington, D.C., Boafo has become something of a local celebrity in Accra. “Sometimes you wake up in the morning and you have 10, 15 people at your door waiting to talk to you,” he said. “Everybody wants to put their problems in front of you. There’s some joy (in it) and there’s some stress.”\n\nHe is enmeshed in the local community through his dot.ateliers initiative — an artists’ residency, launched in 2022, that has since expanded to host writers and curators. Crucially, it offers spaces that foster experimentation and allow participants “to evolve or think on (their) own”, he said, adding: “I imagine dot.ateliers to be an institution which should live beyond me.”\n\nWorking alongside other creatives is key to Boafo’s practice. He frequently collaborates with Glenn DeRoche, the architect behind the courtyard constructed in London, a sculptural installation that also houses some of Boafo’s paintings.\n\n“It was the perfect opportunity to pair what we both enjoy: working within communities, but also storytelling through what we create,” said DeRoché, sitting in the middle of the reimagined Accra courtyard, which has been reinterpreted and abstracted in a charred black timber structure. “I thought it was a beautiful way to start the show, with the seed of Amoako’s creativity, his ancestral birth home, but also to tell a story about community.”\n\nBoafo may soon be shifting his creative focus, but the act of painting is a constant. “I’m always going to paint,” he said. “It makes me feel good.

Sales in the US, the world’s largest art market, decreased by 9%, and slid by 10% in both France and Italy, and 15% in South Korea. “Despite Brexit-related challenges,” per the report, the UK contracted by a more moderate 5%, and has retained its position as the second-largest art market.\n\nAs the report lays out, the dynamics of last year’s contraction broadly mirror those of 2023, when total sales fell by 4% with the highest price points most affected, due to “ongoing geopolitical tensions, economic pressures and shifting buying behavior.”\n\nThe once-booming contemporary sector was hit hard, with sales at auction dropping by 36% to $1.4 billion, their lowest level since 2018. Amid a return to more tried-and-tested names, McAndrew noted a growing aversion to risk among buyers.\n\n“Several dealers spoke of a lack of curiosity among clients,” she said. “They say they used to fight with collectors for works at artists’ studios. Now everyone wants to buy someone they’ve already heard of. The appetite for the unknown isn‘t there anymore.” The report notes that galleries are more heavily relying on their top three best-selling artists due to “more selective buying by collectors.”\n\nHowever, while sale value is down, trading volume grew by 3%, reflecting greater activity at lower-priced segment of works priced under $50,000.\n\nAuction houses last year sold 20% less by value but 4% less by volume, according to the report. A similar trend was seen in the gallery sector, and hinted at the emergence of a more balanced and democratic ecosystem: Dealerships with the smallest turnovers, under $250,000, saw the greatest increase in sales, with a 17% boost, while those with a turnover exceeding $10 million experienced a 9% decline.\n\nHowever, these small gains are undermined by plummeting profitability across most of the art and antiques market, as prices for virtually all aspects of the business, from shipping to rent, have increased.\n\nOther positives to take away from the report, McAndrew said, are the increased sales of work by women artists in the primary market, up 3% year-on-year.\n\nWhile the art market experienced regular fluctuations, the report also shows that for the past decade, it has struggled to reach its 2014 peak, despite a significant increase in wealth among the collecting class, especially billionaires.\n\nReflecting on the future of the art market, one dealer is quoted in the report as saying: “Existing young collectors are no longer buying paintings. With the bursting of the contemporary art bubble, there is a high reliance on older collectors who prefer Modern and Post-War art… (but) many of these collectors are in their 60s and 70s, so I am worried about what the art scene will look like 10 years from now.\n\n“On the other hand, we know there is a high proportion of wealthy people who have no experience in purchasing art, and the challenge for dealers is how to reach them, rather than focusing on existing art collectors.”\n\nRead more stories from The Art Newspaper here.', 'A shift in balance', 'Published 9:58 PM EDT, Tue April 8, 2025', 'global-art-sales-plummeted-by-12-in-2024-says-industry-report-1745808798');

But there’s a catch', 'https://edition.cnn.com/2025/04/03/style/michelangelo-smk-3d-printing-factum-arte/index.html', 'Jacqui Palumbo', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/23c0035-20241204104712-otssm.jpg?q=w_2000,c_fill', 'Most of the sculptures of Renaissance master Michelangelo can\'t travel for shows, so the Madrid-based studio Factum Arte made meticulous 3D-printed and cast reproductions for a new exhibition.', 'Behind the red-bricked facade and marble friezes of the National Gallery of Denmark, visitors are now able to see nearly all of Michelangelo’s existing sculptures — the “most comprehensive” exhibition of his sculptural work assembled in 150 years according to the institution — and more than 1,000 miles away from where the majority of the Renaissance artist’s works are typically seen.\n\nBut to do so, the museum did not haul the 17-foot-tall David from the Galleria dell’Accademia in Florence, or the unfinished figure called “The Genius of Victory” that sits nearby in the Palazzo Vecchio. Instead, “Michelangelo Imperfect,” hosted at the SMK (short for Statens Museum for Kunst), relies on some 40 reproductions, including a new set of 3D-printed copies made for the show by the Madrid-based studio Factum Arte.\n\nIncluded is a 19th-century bronze version of “David,” plaster casts of the four famed allegorical figures seen on the tombs of the Medici Chapel, and 3D-printed and cast sculptures of Pope Julius II’s unfinished tomb. Though it’s not the first time a Michelangelo sculpture has been 3D printed — the University of Florence unveiled a David replica made of acrylic resin at the 2020 Dubai Expo — this time, the technology has been used to help bring together nearly all of the artist’s sculptural works in one place.\n\nThe show also features original works by the Italian artist, including 20 drawings and a group of maquettes — preliminary models in wax and clay.\n\n“It is a bit of an experiment,” said Matthias Wivel, the show’s curator, in a video call with CNN. “It’s an exhibition that consists largely of reproductions.” Today, he added, “it’s not something you see so often.”\n\nMichelangelo Buonarroti, the 15th-to-16th-century sculptor, painter and draftsman who has endured as one of the most famous artists of all time, is recognized for the dynamism and emotional qualities of his classical sculptures. They twist and turn in space, tense their muscles, or hold seemingly precarious poses despite being rendered in solid white Carrara marble.\n\nAt Factum Arte’s studio, the team didn’t just 3D print each object, but used a mix of new and traditional techniques. The intensive process involved recording each work with photogrammetry and Lidar scanning to make a digital twin. They first printed each work in resin, similar to the “David” replica exhibited in Dubai, but they didn’t stop there. Then, they created silicone molds from the printed forms and cast each in a marble composite to get closer to the artist’s original material, before hand-finishing the final sculpture.\n\nVideo credit: Oscar Parasiego for Factum Foundation\n\n“Our goal is to make the (artworks) visually identical under exhibition conditions,” said Factum Arte’s founder Adam Lowe, in a video call with CNN. “You’re able to distinguish a difference if you can touch them or if you can tap them, because the temperature of the marble is not quite the same.”\n\nBut why exhibit replicas at all? And, if it really is virtually indistinguishable to the untrained eye (albeit a little warmer to the touch), is it Michelangelo enough?\n\nToday, we might not assign much value to reproductions, but in the 19th century, plaster cast versions of famous sculptures were the stars of many museums. Institutions like the Art Institute of Chicago began their collections with plaster casts, and the Louvre’s plaster cast workshop, created in 1794, is still active today. Visitors who have traveled to Florence are already likely to have encountered a plaster doppelgänger of Michelangelo’s “David” in its original outdoor location at the Piazza della Signoria, but they have also been erected in London and Moscow, while bronze versions can be found internationally as well. Many were cast soon after the largest Michelangelo exhibition at the time took place in Florence in 1875 to mark the 400th anniversary of his birth, and featured a mix of original sculptures and new plaster duplicates, Wivel said.\n\nBut reproductions eventually fell out of favor, and eventually into disrepair, locked away in storage or destroyed. In 2004, the Metropolitan Museum of Art donated its once-prized collection to the Institute of Classical Architecture & Art. They had previously been neglected in “leaky” storage, The New York Times reported in 1987.\n\n“It was a way of gathering and making accessible works of art that weren’t accessible to the general public, either because they were far away or because you couldn’t see them together,” Wivel explained. “There’s been this sort of fetishism of authenticity around original objects (beginning) in the 20th century.”\n\nIn fact, he added, the entire foundation for Western art would have been upended without reproductions, since precious few original sculptures from Ancient Greece still exist today; the vast majority of our knowledge of the period comes from Roman copies.\n\nThe SMK’s extensive collection of plaster casts already included 27 out of around 45 existing Michelangelo sculptures, making it an ideal institution to host the show, Wivel noted. They were also able to relocate the bronze cast of “David” from 1896 — normally displayed outside in Copenhagen’s harbor district — indoors, becoming a “centerpiece” of the show. “I thought that was probably going to be impossible, but it happened,” Wivel said of moving the sculpture inside.\n\nA show of this magnitude is “something you can only do with replicas,” Wivel said. “You get a richer experience of him as a sculptor by seeing it this way.”\n\nTo see the breadth of Michelangelo’s sculptures, you’d have to travel across Italy and make additional stops in cities around the world, including Bruges, London, New York and Paris. Most can’t move and some are behind bulletproof glass, such as the “Pietà” at St. Peter’s Basilica in Rome, or placed up high in cathedral niches, like four lesser-known saints he carved for a Siena chapel that until now, have never been reproduced. At the SMK, visitors will have unprecedented intimacy with nearly his entire sculptural output — though not quite all, as some institutions did not give permission to make copies, including two of the four unfinished nude prisoners Michelangelo carved for the tomb of Pope Julius II. (Those missing icons are “the great frustration of the show,” Wivel lamented.)\n\nBut all of the institutions who loaned the works will own the imaging and data that Factum Arte recorded, which — as they demonstrate through the exhibition — can be invaluable for conservation efforts. One of the most work-intensive replicas they made is a reconstruction of Michelangelo’s early sculpture of St. John the Baptist as an infant from 1495–96, which was housed in El Salvador chapel in Úbeda, but smashed during the Spanish Civil War. Conservators took 19 years to restore the work, which went back on view in 2015, but Factum Arte sought to improve upon it by scanning, printing, and casting each of the fragments before reassembling it.\n\n“We spent two and a half years working on the reconstruction to put the fragments back as they might have been,” Lowe said.\n\nFactum Arte’s data provides invaluable information for institutions, Wivel said. “Its accuracy is down to micron level… And that’s very useful in the future (for) conservation treatments. You can refer back and see what it was like at that time, especially if it’s damaged.”\n\nThe scans they capture are taken around 20 inches away from the works and “capture right down to the tiniest marks in the surface,” Lowe explained — even dirt and dust, which can prove challenging as it reads as extra volume or noise in the digital model.\n\nThe scans do have their limitations if parts of the sculptures are inaccessible, like the backs of some that are positioned in chapel niches. But the material and surface details mimic marble in a way that plaster can’t, Lowe emphasized, from the marble veining that’s meticulously added to match the original works, to adding dirt and cracks to the sandblasted exteriors to match the texture and condition.\n\nIn video clips of the studio taken by Factum Arte, monumental pieces of the sculpture sit together as they come to life over months and years. Spending that time with each work can profoundly change one’s impression of them, according to Sol Costales Doulton, the studio’s project manager who oversaw their making.\n\n“The way you perceive these objects, it changes totally,” she said in the video call with Lowe. “The Genius of Victory” was one that began to subtly transform the more she spent time with it, she explained.\n\n“Everybody saw him as a quite dispassionate, detached, idolized beauty. And then you start looking at him, and he starts gaining depth, and there’s actually something quite mysterious and deep in his eyesight, (like) something is calling him over his shoulder,” she recalled. “So the psychological charge that the sculpture expresses is totally different when you get a chance to be with it and listen to what it’s saying.”\n\nThough it was a privileged position to have that length of time, she encourages visitors to take advantage of the proximity of the works together in one show, and really sit with them.\n\n“So many times in passing through a gallery or a museum, you’re rushed to see all the masterpieces. Your attention span will be limited to a minute, a minute-and-a-half, and then you’ll move on to the next object,” she said. “So the possibility of being with them for months, they start to unravel many different narratives.”', 'Creating twins', 'Published 2:56 AM EDT, Thu April 3, 2025', 'its-among-the-largest-collections-of-michelangelo-sculptures-ever-shown-but-theres-a-catch-1745808798'),

From his studio inside an industrial building in North London, there is an assortment of framed, large-scale works of art — some hung on the walls, others neatly lined up on the floor. The British illustrator-turned-photographer, whose lens has captured numerous stars including Elton John, Donatella Versace and Kate Moss, is recounting his pivot into camerawork and the beauty of shooting with film.\n\nThe unpredictable nature of film photography has been a powerful motivator for Aldridge across his extensive career, spanning around three decades. “At that point, you only have your eyes to trust,” said Aldridge, of the process when shooting with film. “You don’t know if it was in focus (or) if you’ve got something meaningful until you get the film back and start working on it. And I like that way of working, because the anxiety of not knowing drives you to work harder and be more determined to get (the shot),” he told CNN.\n\nIt’s an intriguing statement from a photographer known for working only in highly controlled environments. The son of Alan Aldridge, a graphic designer and illustrator who created some of the most enduring pop imagery of the 1960s and ’70s, Aldridge rose to prominence in the mid-’90s when he began working with Franca Sozzani, the longstanding editor-in-chief of Vogue Italia who died in 2016. With painstaking attention given to the lighting, composition and color, Aldridge’s immaculately crafted images often feature glamorous women in moody, suspenseful settings that add an air of intrigue.\n\nA culmination of those works is now going on show in London. At Sotheby’s Story Café, the walls and accompanying props and furnishings will be covered, from floor to ceiling, with Aldridge’s kaleidoscopic imagery of women in the kitchen, including one carving ham.\n\nA retrospective exhibition, co-hosted by Sotheby’s and the Lyndsey Ingram gallery, will also run until April 17, featuring some of Aldridge’s most iconic shoots, such as “Chromo Thriller #3”, which depicts a woman with coiffed blonde curls, wearing a strappy lace night dress tucked into her underwear. Her arm is held up, a coral-colored hairdryer in hand, next to her head. “This one really emphasizes the cinematic aspects of my work,” said Aldridge. “She’s in a dark, sort of spooky bathroom. I designed the colors (to resemble) one of Francis Bacon’s paintings.”\n\nThe initial idea, Aldridge explained, was for the model to blow dry her hair in a sexy way. “I checked to see if the colors were pleasing and satisfying,” he said. “We started the shoot, but I wasn’t quite sure what it was about. After a while I decided to review all the Polaroids (used to test shots) and I saw this one (with her) just standing there, sort of static. I realized it felt like she was holding a gun to her head. There was a quietness in her body language compared to the other (images), which were more expressive and loose. And so, the picture feels special in the way that it revealed itself to me through the process. There’s a lot of that in my work.”\n\nRather than take a documentarian approach to photography, which tends to be more reactive and spontaneous, Aldridge’s process can be compared to that of a film director — starting with a storyboard, then the casting and set design. A single shoot can require several months of preparation.\n\nThe advent of digital photography has made capturing and sharing moments easier and more accessible. But “when you work on digital, you have that instant satisfaction, and I think it actually relaxes the creative muscle,” Aldridge reasoned, adding that working with film allows for a more serendipitous result. “When photography is too organized and prepared, you lose some of the vitality,” he said.\n\nAldridge’s exhibition follows a special edition of Toiletpaper magazine, published in February, which featured several of his surreal images. “When a friend of mine, a stylist, started to work for (artist Maurizio Cattelan and photographer Pierpaolo Ferrari, the founders of Toiletpaper), I said ‘please pass on my compliments’. They came straight back saying they (also) loved my work and often reviewed my images as inspiration,” said Aldridge. “There was a sense of wanting to celebrate this.”\n\nAlso on display for the first time are lesser-seen works, such as “Hahaha!”, a chromogenic print of a woman laughing, and a series called “Doors,” featuring a cast of female characters coming in and out of what appears to be the doors of their homes. Their activities might seem banal — carrying a bag of groceries filled with fruits and vegetables, or a fluffy white cat — but the sharp color coordination and gussied up models give the images a psychedelic feel. It’s a mood that has often evaded the work of Aldridge, who throughout our conversation rattles off a long list of creative influences, including the films of Federico Fellini and David Lynch, paintings by Caravaggio, and photography from Richard Avedon and Diane Arbus, as well as the album covers created by his father for the likes of The Beatles and The Who.\n\nIn an unexpected turn, one-on-one Polaroid portrait sessions are also being offered to the public at Sotheby’s in April, allowing them to experience “15 minutes of fame” with Aldridge. Props including feather boas, oversized glasses and retro telephones will be available on set. Visitors will get to keep “the best” photograph, signed by Aldridge, while he’ll hang onto the outtakes and potentially use them for a future exhibition, depending on the results, he said. It marks another first for the photographer, who rarely turns his lens to someone who isn’t a model or celebrity. (One exception took place prior to the pandemic, when Aldridge took polaroids of private collectors who were visiting his studio.)\n\nFor Aldridge, the upcoming project brings a sense of excitement and unease. “How will you survive this? How will you achieve it?” he mused. “I’m somebody who likes to control the dynamic of (my) portraits, but in this, I’m relinquishing some control, because the person will want to direct to some degree what is happening.” He continued, “They may not want to look like they are thinking deeply about themselves, which is often an image in my pictures. They might be laughing. They might be wearing horrible clothes that they think are nice, or they may want their hair done in a certain way. There is a wrestle.”\n\n“We are always looking for ways to reimagine our spaces,” Sotheby’s global head of photographs Emily Bierman told CNN. “We wanted to push the boundaries within our walls, and who better to do just that than Miles?” She added that the portrait sessions offered “a rare opportunity” for visitors to become part of Aldridge’s artistic process. “His striking hyper-stylized images have never felt more relevant than today — in an age where social media curates a vision of perfection that often conceal deeper, darker truths. It really feels like his work holds a mirror up to this,” said Bierman.\n\nAnd while Aldridge may have little say over his subject matter, the sophisticated pizzazz that comes with his technique is sure to shine through.\n\n“Photography is a medium where it’s very hard to do that. Even the world’s worst painter could do better, because painting (allows for) more of a signature. As a photographer, how can you bend the camera to your will, to create your picture?” he said. It’s a challenge that Aldridge has taken in stride. “I dread it, but I think it’s good for you, as a photographer and as an artist, to be taken out of your comfort zone.”', '', 'Published 5:35 AM EDT, Mon March 31, 2025', 'you-only-have-your-eyes-to-trust-miles-aldridge-on-shooting-film-in-the-digital-age-1745808798'),

Another viral X post depicted the platform’s owner, Elon Musk, playing with cutlery — an image based on the recent video of the billionaire balancing spoons during a dinner hosted by Trump in New Jersey.\n\nAlso widely shared, however, is a 2016 video in which Studio Ghibli co-founder Hayao Miyazaki describes AI-generated art as an “insult to life itself.” Miyazaki is known for his hand-drawn animation and painstaking frame-by-frame method.\n\n“I am utterly disgusted,” he says in the video, responding to a video of a monster character generated using text prompts. “If you really want to make creepy stuff, you can go ahead and do it, but I would never wish to incorporate this technology into my work at all.”\n\nOpenAI’s updated image generator has also prompted renewed discussions over the role of AI and art. It comes just weeks after nearly 4,000 people signed an open letter calling on Christie’s auction house to cancel a first-of-its-kind sale dedicated solely to AI art over concerns that the programs used to create some generative digital pieces are trained on copyrighted work and exploit human artists.\n\nOpenAI’s CEO Sam Altman made light of the trend on X, joking that after “a decade trying to help make superintelligence to cure cancer or whatever” it was Studio Ghibli images that had generated viral interest in his work.\n\n“Mostly no one cares for first 7.5 years, then for 2.5 years everyone hates you for everything,” he wrote. “Wake up one day to hundreds of messages: ‘Look I made you into a twink Ghibli style haha’” Altman added, referring to a gay slang term for men who are young, boyish and slim.\n\nAs is often the case with AI-generated art, the images raise various copyright questions — not only around Studio Ghibli’s work but of the images being reimagined.

Photographer Irina Werning\'s long-term project on long hair in Latin America took her to the Kichwa community for its final chapter.', 'Over the past two decades, the Argentinian photographer Irina Werning has traveled around Latin America with a specific directive in mind: find women — and eventually, men — with the longest hair.\n\nTitled “Las Pelilargas,” or “The Long-haired Ones,” the body of work celebrates the shared cultural reverence for long tresses across the region, in both small Indigenous communities and urban centers. In her interviews with the people she met and photographed, Werning heard many personal reasons for growing and maintaining ultra-long hair, but connecting stories was often its role in cultural identity and ancestral traditions.\n\n“The true reason is invisible and passes from generation to generation,” Werning writes on her website. “It’s the culture of Latin America, where our ancestors believed that cutting hair was cutting life, that hair is the physical manifestation of our thoughts and our souls and our connection to the land.”\n\nAt the PhotoVogue festival in Milan earlier this month, Werning exhibited the final chapter in the series, called “La Resistencia,” which features portraits of Indigenous Kichwa living in Otavalo, Ecuador.\n\n“I was very intrigued by how it would be to photograph men after so many years of photographing women,” she explained on a phone call with CNN — particularly as long hair is often associated with femininity.\n\nWerning’s extensive body of work began in the Andes. As she was photographing schools around Argentina’s Indigenous Kolla community in the northwest, during her travels she encountered women with exceptionally long hair, and took their images.\n\n“I went back to Buenos Aires, and these pictures were haunting me,” Werning recalled. “So I decided to go back to these small towns.” In the absence of widely used social media platforms in 2006, she put up signs that said she was searching for long-haired women for artistic purposes. As she traveled to more places, she organized long-hair competitions to bring more women together. “Slowly, the project started to grow,” she said. She completed the work in February 2024 with the images in “La Resistencia.”\n\nIn different parts of the world, braids have become powerful symbols of identity as well as defiance against colonialism and systemic racial injustice. In the Kichwa community, as in other Indigenous groups in North and South America, men and boys wear long braids to reclaim the tradition after a history of forced hair cutting during Spanish colonial rule and pressures to assimilate, Werning said.\n\n“Braids in Indigenous communities are a form of resistance, in a way, because conquerors would cut (them),” she said. “The braid was a symbol of identity, of unity. It’s more difficult to take away someone’s language, but this is a very symbolic act that’s very easy to do.”\n\nIn one image from “La Resistencia,” sisters, dressed in traditional white blouses, gather at a table as their father braids their brother’s hair. Werning said when the father, RUMInawi Cachimuel, was young, his family cut his braids so that he wouldn’t face discrimination at school. But now, he emphasizes the importance of maintaining Kichwa traditions to his children, from their clothing and music to their hair, she explained.\n\n“We’ve fought hard for our braids; it was a lengthy struggle to proudly showcase our braids,” Cachimuel told Werning in a translated interview. “As people, we’ve endured significant hardships. Now, I teach my children that they must learn from our ancestors and pass down to future generations what it means to be Kichwa.”\n\nIn another portrait, a father and his two boys stand in a line, braiding each other’s hair, which only direct relatives are allowed to do, she explained.\n\n“Las Pelilargas” will be published as a book later this year. As the series comes to a close, Werning says she’s returned to some places she visited early on, wondering if they had been impacted by any major cultural shifts, like the rise of social media platforms.\n\n“As a photographer, we are kind of pessimistic, (thinking) ‘this is something disappearing, so I need to document it,’ and in a way it’s true because globalization really does change communities,” she said.

Commissions of doctors and theologians then examine the miracles before the pope makes the ultimate decision to canonize someone.\n\nGaudí is a rare case. Few artists become saints and no architect, in the modern understanding of the profession, has ever been canonized.\n\nGaudí’s legacy is intrinsically linked with Catholicism as he dedicated much of his career to the Sagrada Família – a church of such awesome splendor that it remains unfinished more than 140 years after construction began.\n\nHe envisioned the church to be “a Bible in stone” and designed a monumental structure with 18 huge, spindle-shaped towers, each symbolizing a different biblical figure – the 12 apostles, the four evangelists, the Virgin Mary and Jesus.\n\nWhen it is finally completed in 2026, the tower of Jesus Christ will stand at 172.5 meters (566 feet) tall and will be finished with a 17-meter-tall (56-foot) four-armed cross, making it the world’s tallest church.\n\nInside, the nave is bathed in multicolored light that streams in from every direction through ornately decorated stained-glass windows.\n\nGaudí never saw the church anywhere near completion. He died in 1926, when only an estimated 10%-15% of the project had been built, including one transept, a crypt and some of the apse wall.\n\nAlthough Gaudí dedicated the remaining few years of his life and career exclusively to the Sagrada Família, other buildings bearing his distinctive style are dotted all over Barcelona, lending the city much of its character.\n\nFor decades, there has been a movement calling for Gaudí’s beatification, known as the Association for the Beatification of Antoni Gaudí.

Photos of him wearing an enormous brown blanket scarf, which resurface each year, have become a reliable indicator of the approaching winter. And he’s never far from a pair of leather pants, which the 60-year-old American musician proved last year when he posted a video to TikTok bench pressing while doing sit-ups at the gym in black leather, a sheer mesh tank and sunglasses. (“This isn’t how everyone’s dad works out?” his daughter, the actor Zoë Kravitz, asked “The Tonight Show” host Jimmy Fallon in response to the video).\n\nBut over the years, the rock star has also provided a window into his life through his homes, from the idyllic Brazilian ranch that Architectural Digest (AD) toured in 2019, to the beachside Airstream trailer he occupies for part of the year in the Bahamian island of Eleuthera. For AD’s “Star Power” issue, published today, Kravitz is showing off the grand Paris townhouse he has had for two decades and was the previous palatial home of a countess.\n\nKravitz was taken aback by the enormous space when he first saw it, located in the 16th arrondissement, the French capital’s home to embassies, museums and luxury shopping. In the early 2000s, he had already released several Platinum albums, but had in mind something more modest: “a little apartment, maybe on the Seine — one bedroom, two bedrooms, maximum — where I could write and hang out,” he recalled to AD.\n\nIt was his real estate agent who encouraged him to see the “once-in-a-generation” listing, he added. When he arrived, he thought perhaps he was touring a single floor, not the entire property.\n\n“I said, ‘No, no, no, no, absolutely not.’” Inside though, his feelings changed. “I walked in and said, ‘This is my house.’ Spiritually, I knew.”\n\nYears later, the home feels undeniably his — “a true reflection of his personality and creative energy,” noted Marina Hemonet, head of editorial content for AD France, in an email to CNN.\n\nFrom the airy interiors outfitted with work by blue-chip artists, traditional African art and some of his own studio’s furniture designs — Kravitz Design was included in the prestigious AD100 list in 2023 — to the eccentric wine room and red-lit subterranean party space he calls “The Chaufferie,” the musician has continued to transform the space as an extension of himself. (Though he’s not the only Kravitz to enjoy the home, as Zoë has “been having a lot of soirées” in the speakeasy-esque boiler room, he told AD.)\n\n“The things he surrounds himself with — (Andy) Warhol masterpieces, African artifacts, major music memorabilia, and rare furnishings by Paul Evans, Karl Springer, Afra and Tobia Scarpa, Joe Colombo, and others — offer an astounding feast of the dreamily recherché,” AD’s global editorial director, Amy Astley, who leads AD U.S., wrote in the issue’s editor’s letter.\n\nKravitz’s sensibility reflects his upbringing, he noted to the magazine. He often moved between his parents’ Upper East Side apartment in Manhattan — his mother, Roxie Roker, was an actor best known for “The Jeffersons;” his father, Sy Kravitz, was a TV producer for NBC — to his grandparents’ home in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn.\n\n“Two completely different worlds,” he said.\n\nHe calls his aesthetic “soulful elegance,” which is “comfortable, clearly. But also chic,” he explained. “I love that balance of African, European, and Afrofuturism mixed with midcentury pieces. I love things that are extremely glamorous and also extremely brutal.”\n\nAnd though artworks by Andy Warhol, Jean-Michel Basquiat and Richard Avedon hang on his walls, it’s a portrait by the photographer Ruven Afanador of Kravitz’s late grandfather, Albert Roker, that he considers a centerpiece of his home. Afanador photographed the cover for the musician’s fourth album, “Circus,” released in 1995, and his grandfather attended the shoot.\n\n“I put my grandfather in one of my suits, and Ruven took a bunch of portraits of him. He is why I am here, and why I’m in this house, why my mom went to Howard University in DC and studied at the Shakespeare Institute in Stratford-upon-Avon and became who she became, then I became who I became, and Zoë became who she became,” Kravitz said. “It’s all him.

Bisecting the area like a vein is J.K. Randle Road. To one side of its pavement, flaking gray walls ring the Nigerian National Museum, a near-70-year-old remnant from the era of British colonial rule.\n\nDirectly opposite, its red and gold lattices arcing over a perimeter of lush greenery towards the sky, the John Randle Centre for Yoruba History and Culture opened last October and is challenging the traditional Western model of what a museum is meant to be.\n\nInviting visitors to step into a “fantasy land” of Yoruba folklore, the Centre is a living manifestation of the culture that binds Nigeria’s second-largest ethnic group, as well as a loud, colorful “alternative narrative” to the one told across the road, says the project’s lead architect Seun Oduwole.\n\n“It objectifies the culture, as opposed to celebrating it,” he said of the National Museum’s “Eurocentric” approach.\n\nIn 2018, Lagos-based architectural firm SI.SA was commissioned to build the Centre on a site where, in the 1920s, Sierra-Leone born local physician John Randle had funded the construction of a swimming pool where Nigerians could learn to swim, at a time when the country was a British colony.\n\nDr. Will Rea, a British academic specializing in African art and Yoruba history, was born in Nigeria and worked under the Nigerian National Commission for Museums and Monuments before joining the John Randle Centre project as lead consultant curator.\n\nRea saw it as a chance to prove that Nigeria could produce museums of the highest quality, while also challenging how the continent has often been depicted in Western museums.\n\n“Africa tends to be sort of dark and brown, and there’s a lack of color,” said Rea, who was charged with writing the academic narrative for the Centre and deciding what objects were needed. “If you go to the British Museum (in London), you’ll see that Africa is in the basement. It’s beautifully spotlit, but it’s still very much things stuck behind vitrines (display cabinets), and you can’t really move.\n\n“It’s very different to what the experience of being on the street in Lagos or Ikole (a town in southwest Nigeria) actually is. So we were keen to have a very lively place, full of color and sound – very different to a normal Western museum, where everything is kind of hushed.”\n\nOduwole added: “A lot of times our culture is viewed as this sort of archaic, ancient civilization that was pulled out of the darkness. We wanted to break that.”\n\nBut the pair’s ambition immediately ran into a critical problem: they had no collection to build a museum around.\n\nSo began a mad dash for Oduwole, Rea and a host of hired collectors, who fanned out across Nigeria and international museums to look for artefacts of Yoruba origin.\n\nMany were too expensive to buy outright, meaning that procuring loans became the primary solution. A partnership was secured with the British Museum to send a selection of objects on a long-term loan basis — among them, the Lander Stool.\n\nThis Yoruba wood carving was taken to the UK by British explorer Richard Lander following an expedition to Nigeria in the 1830s and has since become a symbol of the long-running restitution debate concerning the return of African cultural objects, says Rea.\n\nIn 2019, the Lagos State government formally asked for the return of the stool, designating the upcoming Centre a “befitting home.” Oduwole says a long-term loan has been agreed, although it is yet to go on display at the Centre.\n\nEasing the pressure was the decision that artefacts would make up just a quarter of the exhibition space, designed by international museum exhibition design firm Ralph Appelbaum Associates.\n\nThe team were determined to portray Yoruba culture as dynamic and ever-changing, an ongoing story that had to be experienced via a multitude of senses. For example, the music of Afrobeat legend Fela Kuti was an evolution of Oríkì praise poetry sung in small Yoruba villages that incorporates drums and dance, Rea explained.\n\nTo reflect this, only the first of the exhibition’s four main areas focuses on the past. After a section on Yoruba myths and legends, visitors are taken on a journey through modern-day customs and practices ending at an imagined future Yoruba culture.\n\nInteractive opportunities are abundant throughout. The team contacted Jimi Solanke, the baritone voice for a generation of young Nigerians courtesy of his popular after-school TV shows, to record some of his children’s stories onto a radiogram (a record player incorporated into furniture). Though Solanke died last year, his tales endure for a new generation in the Centre, playing out under a tree to mimic the setting where Yoruba elders traditionally passed on information to youngsters.\n\nStepping in front of one camera will transform guests via digital projection into Egúngún masquerades, wooden-mask-wearing figures who embody the spirits of ancestors during ritual and festival performances.\n\n“I’ve never seen anything like that in a Western museum,” Rea said. “Whether that’s US, or UK, or Nigeria, the technology in there is really cutting edge. It’s quite phenomenal.”\n\nVisitors are also turned into various Yoruba deities, the Orisha. Visualizing Shango, the god of thunder, as a superhero-like figure presented a chance to reimagine often “misunderstood” Yoruba deities in the same way the Marvel Cinematic Universe has done for figures in the Ancient Greek and Nordic pantheon, Oduwole explained.\n\nIt’s another way of celebrating how Yoruba’s heritage is relevant in the modern world, with Rea highlighting Beyoncé’s allusions to the yellow-dress-wearing goddess of fertility and love, Oshun, in projects like “Lemonade” and “Black is King.”\n\n“She’s channeling Oshun, no doubt about it,” he said.\n\nThroughout the museum, Yoruba language text is displayed first and foremost, with English translations below, in a smaller font.\n\nIt was part of the mission to make an “unapologetically Yoruba” site, Oduwole said, right down to the architecture itself. Aggregates, coarse materials like sand and gravel, were used in flooring to mimic the sand floors of Yoruba villages, with reclaimed wood hung from the ceilings to hide air-conditioning units.\n\nThe very arrangement of the wood is a nod to Ifá, a Yoruba divination system that — much like binary — uses single and double lines to represent a total of 256 signs.\n\n“A priest can come and read it but if you’re not, you just look at it as a really nice abstract pattern,” Oduwole said.\n\n“So depending on your level of understanding there’s different layers of meaning as you go right through … if you’re a culture bearer, the symbolism jumps out at you immediately.”\n\nThe sloping green-roofed shape of the building, seemingly emerging from the earth, is itself a reflection of a Yoruba proverb about the circularity of life, while also paying homage to the act of ascending to Ori-Oke (“destiny at the top”) — a prayer mountain in Yorubaland of southwestern Nigeria.\n\nThe arrangement of the landscape around the Centre — which includes the restored pool and a public square — follows Yoruba principles, wherein the living quarters of a town would fan out in a hierarchy of importance from the palace and courtyard at the heart.\n\nPut all together, the Centre aims to be a beacon for a diaspora that has spread across the globe.\n\n“They can come from around the world, and they will have pride in being Yoruba and saying, ‘This is our museum, this is my culture, and I understand it,’” said Rea.', '‘A very lively place, full of color’', 'Published 4:20 AM EDT, Wed April 9, 2025', 'this-lagos-museum-is-challenging-the-traditional-eurocentric-model-1745808799'),

Frequent power outages mean that elevators in residential buildings often do not function, making daily life difficult for those living in upper floors. As a result, younger residents are typically assigned higher apartments, while older residents are moved to lower floors to minimize the physical strain of climbing stairs, as witnessed by CNN during multiple visits to the country.\n\nHousing shortages remain a significant challenge for North Korea, which is also grappling with a faltering economy, surging commodity prices, and ongoing food insecurity. A 2021 study by researchers from South Korea’s Institute of Civil Engineering and Building Technology suggested that the country only has enough homes to accommodate 70% to 80% of its households. Outside of the showpiece capital, many homes are dilapidated and lack consistent access to electricity, clean water and sewage services.\n\nThe new neighborhood features numerous tall towers — two of which are connected by a soaring skybridge — as well as “educational, commercial and service facilities,” according to state media. KCNA claimed that Kim was closely involved in the design and “energetically led the work of drawing up the construction plan.”\n\nKim’s site visit comes ahead of the official opening ceremony on April 15, one of the country’s most important public holidays, celebrating the birthday of his grandfather, North Korea’s late founder, Kim Il Sung.\n\nThe opening will complete the third stage of construction at Hwasong, an area described by state media as a “beautiful and modern urban quarter” that signifies “a new era of prosperity” for Pyongyang.\n\nPyongyang has been largely closed off to visitors since North Korea shut its borders in response to the Covid-19 pandemic more than five years ago. A small number of Russian tourists visited the city in 2024, though the capital was off-limits to the international tour group that entered the country last month before trips were again suspended. The latter group was only permitted to visit Rason, a special economic zone near the country’s border with China and Russia.\n\nHwasong is the latest in a series of recent urban developments in Pyongyang, which is known for its pastel-colored, Soviet-style architecture. Other large residential projects have been built around Mirae Scientists Street and Songhwa Street, where the country’s second tallest building — the Songhwa Street Main Tower — was completed in 2022.\n\nNorth Korea is also expanding housing beyond Pyongyang, building thousands of homes in mining towns and rural areas. While these projects aim to modernize the country, they rely on soldiers and civilian laborers working under harsh conditions with little pay.\n\nHousing is assigned by the government, prioritizing those who are considered most loyal to the ruling Kim family and people working in sectors considered most valuable to the nation, such as scientists and engineers.\n\nState media has previously boasted about the pace of construction in the capital, dubbing it “Pyongyang Speed.” Officials claim to have completed the frame of a 70-story skyscraper at the capital’s Ryomyong New Town in just 74 days.\n\nBut experts have expressed concerns about the quality of the construction materials and workmanship on the country’s building projects — especially after a Pyongyang apartment building, which may have housed dozens of families, collapsed in 2014. State media attributed the disaster, for which no official death count was disclosed, to “sloppy building” and “irresponsible supervision of officials.”\n\nNorth Korea’s military, which plays a central role in the country’s construction projects, has likely been instrumental in completing the new district, as it has with previous large-scale developments. There are more than 1 million active-duty personnel and conscription is mandatory. Most men are required to serve for at least ten years, starting from age 17, often without any contact with their families. Even after serving, they remain part of a civil paramilitary force, numbering in the millions.\n\nKim has recently signaled that his government’s construction plans now stretch beyond the five-year targets announced in 2021. Last month, he said the capital’s “rundown and old” neighborhoods will also be redeveloped in the near future.', '', 'Published 6:18 AM EDT, Wed March 19, 2025', 'north-korea-unveils-new-10000home-showpiece-residential-district-1745808799');

At this scale, even ants would be too big to represent people in the streets below.\n\nThese lifelike miniatures of iconic landmarks can be found on the Panorama — which, at 9,335 square feet, is the largest model of New York City, meticulously hand-built at a scale of 1:1,200. The sprawling model sits in its own room at the Queens Museum, where it was first installed in the 1960s, softly rotating between day and night lighting as visitors on glass walkways are given a bird’s eye view of all five boroughs of the city.\n\nTo mark the model’s 60th anniversary, which was celebrated last year, the museum has published a new book offering a behind-the-scenes look at how the Panorama was made. Original footage of the last major update to the model, completed in 1992, has also gone on show at the museum as part of a 12-minute video that features interviews with some of the renovators.\n\nThe Queens Museum’s assistant director of archives and collections, Lynn Maliszewski, who took CNN on a visit of the Panorama in early March, said she hopes the book and video will help to draw more visitors and attention to the copious amount of labor — over 100 full-time workers, from July 1961 to April 1964 — that went into building the model.\n\n“Sometimes when I walk in here, I get goosebumps, because this is so representative of dreams and hopes and family and struggle and despair and excitement… every piece of the spectrum of human emotion is here (in New York) happening at the same time,” said Maliszewski. “It shows us things that you can’t get when you’re on the ground.”\n\nThe Panorama was originally built for the 1964 New York World’s Fair, then the largest international exhibition in the US, aimed at spotlighting the city’s innovation. The fair was overseen by Robert Moses, the influential and notorious urban planner whose highway projects displaced hundreds of thousands New Yorkers. When Moses commissioned the Panorama, which had parts that could be removed and redesigned to determine new traffic patterns and neighborhood designs, he saw an opportunity to use it as a city planning tool.\n\nOriginally built and revised with a margin of error under 1%, the model was updated multiple times before the 1990s, though it is now frozen in time. According to Maliszewski, it cost over $672,000 to make in 1964 ($6.8 million in today’s money) and nearly $2 million (about $4.5 million today) was spent when it was last revised in 1992.\n\nAs to why the Panorama hasn’t had another update since, Maliszewski believes that the labor and financial resources required to capture three decades of new buildings would be “unparalleled.” Additionally, the unique nature of modelmaking requires specialists that are hard to come by. While the craft was once utilized by many architects, city planners and designers, it has largely been replaced by digital modeling, Maliszewski explained.\n\nNonetheless, the model’s historical accuracy adds to its charm. “What we’re looking at is January 1, 1992, which is bonkers, as far as thinking about how much has changed (and) how many whole neighborhoods would not even be recognizable if you shrunk yourself down and were on this model,” Maliszewski said. “The world continues to evolve so quickly, right? But in (New York) city, infrastructurally, it’s at an even faster clip.”\n\nThe Panorama is supported by 497 steel legs, with layers of wood and foam that were sculpted to resemble the topography of New York City, according to the book. Tiny bridges made of brass and several acrylic cars, buses, trains and subway cars adorn the model, which was originally designed to be walked across by visitors — at least for the areas with flatter and smaller buildings and large waterways and parks.\n\nThe model contains around 895,000 replica buildings, including brownstones and private homes, made through acrylic injection molding, and distinctive structures, such as skyscrapers, museums and churches, made from hand-painted wood and paper.\n\nFrom the five updates that took place between its original construction and the last renovation, the most prominent additions include the gigantic World Trade Center complex — the twin towers are still represented on the model — as well as Battery Park City, a former landfill that was redeveloped in the 1970s, and the Lincoln Center, the city’s cornerstone for arts and culture. Among the notably missing new landmarks, however, is the Hudson Yards neighborhood (also home to one of CNN’s headquarters), the High Line, a 1.45-mile-long walkway converted from a freight railroad in the late 2000s, and the numerous “super-skinny” skyscrapers now dominating parts of the city’s skyline.\n\nOne of the crew members involved in the 1992 revision, Tom Jarrow, remembers seeing the model during the 1964-1965 World Fair, when he was about seven years old. At the time, there was a plastic tracked car “helicopter” ride that circled around its perimeter, allowing riders to view the model city at a simulated 20,000 foot elevation.\n\n“Looking at (the model), it’s daunting to think that any set of human beings could create something so massive and large (with) so much detail,” Jarrow told CNN on a phone call.\n\nJarrow, who had worked for Lester & Associates, the origin architectural modelmakers of the Panorama, for 15 years before starting his own exhibit specialist company, S-Tech Associates, recalled some of the meticulous tasks carried out during the renovation, which marked the only time the model, weighing about 45,000 pounds, had ever been removed from the room it currently sits in.\n\nSome of the labor included acid etching the finer details of the windows and doorways, casting hundreds of new shapes for additional buildings, and producing tiny trees and shrubbery from painted sponges. “If we had 3D printers back then, it would have been fantastic — we could have 3D printed everything, but everything was done by hand,” Jarrow said.\n\nJarrow’s main work was electrical — the Panorama used to be lit up by over 3,000 tiny colored light bulbs that needed to be manually unscrewed each time one needed to be replaced. As part of the renovation, Jarrow updated the model with brighter lights, although he had to use technology that even at the time was considered outdated because of price restrictions, he recalled. “There’s miles and miles of wires underneath that model, and it’s all low voltage lighting,” he said. Most of the bulbs, which originally served to color code different municipal facilities around the city, are no longer functioning today.\n\nBoth Jarrow and Maliszewski agree that the current model would benefit from a more modernized lighting system that would be easier to manage, and also be more interactive for guests, which the museum is working to achieve by 2027 through a grant funded by the Institute of Museum and Library Services. Additionally, the museum would like to digitally add subway lines, which do not currently feature on the model but plays a key role in the average New Yorker’s experience, said Maliszewski.\n\nTo maintain the model’s appearance, it is cleaned by the museum in its entirety at least twice a year. From dusting its intricate features with brushes of different sizes to using a low intensity vacuum to carefully suck up the dust, it’s a process that can take up to two weeks, Maliszewski said. To finance the museum’s efforts, a long-running program allows visitors to “adopt” a piece of the model, whether that is their apartment building, a restaurant, a park or any other feature that speaks to them. By paying a yearly “rent” or donation to the museum, they can receive a deed to owning a property on the model.\n\n“This model brings out so much for people, as far as their history and nostalgia and memory,” Maliszewski said, adding it shows that “we’re really not that far apart from each other, even if you never leave your neighborhood, or if you never leave your borough… there’s still millions of people just a few miles away from you.”', 'Original purpose', 'Published 12:28 PM EDT, Mon March 17, 2025', 'the-worlds-largest-architectural-model-captures-new-york-city-in-the-90s-1745808799'),

Known locally as Paris Galli, or Paris Street, it transports visitors to a European city with grand Neoclassical architecture and a harmonious melange of Art Deco, Baroque and hybrid Indian styles.\n\nSidhpur is less than three hours’ drive from Gujarat’s capital Ahmedabad, but it remains under the radar of travelers and architecture enthusiasts. On the day of my visit, the neighborhood around Paris Galli appeared largely deserted, except for occasional passersby in the distinctive colored hijabs and gold and white caps worn by the Dawoodi Bohras, a Shia Muslim sect that first settled in this part of western India in the 11th century.\n\nThe Bohras are a close-knit trading community that originated in Egypt and later traveled around North Africa, the Middle East and South Asia to trade in spices, gems and perfumes. The sect’s seat was later moved from Yemen to Sidhpur, where its followers showcased their prosperity and wealth by building hundreds of opulent residences in the first half of the 20th century. These housing clusters were called Bohrawads or Vohrawads, and the mansions’ owners tried to outdo one another with chandeliers, Belgian glass and antique furniture, or by hosting grand dinners.\n\nThe community’s close trading connections with Europe may have influenced its architectural sensibilities. The region’s maharaja at the time, Sayajirao Gaekwad III, was also known to be fond of European architecture. He laid out strict planning rules, inspired by Scottish urban planner Patrick Geddes (who lived in India between 1914 and 1924), that resulted in strikingly uniform streetscapes, according to Sidhpur-born architect Zoyab A. Kadi.\n\n“The Bohras extended their help to other communities during a famine in the early 1900s, and (in return) the Maharaja of Baroda gifted them a tract of land, as they were facing a housing shortage,” he said. “It was on this land that they started building these magnificent edifices, which had to adhere to strict town planning rules.”\n\nFound mostly in Najampura district, where Paris Galli is located, the long, narrow mansions are made mainly of wood (the material’s flexibility is an advantage in earthquake-prone regions) in addition to plaster and brick. The designs feature gabled roofs, pilasters and columns, carved doors and ornate overhanging “jharokha” windows that protrude from the front of each mansion. The main living floor is located above street level over a basement; stepped plinths, or “otlas,” act like porches and were traditionally used as social spaces; whimsical monograms, featuring family initials or surnames in English, are often displayed on the buildings’ facades.\n\n“The courtyard houses, built in rows or sequence, exhibit rhythm with diversity,” said Ahmedabad-based conservation architect, Ashish Trambadia, over the phone. “While each house has a unique color scheme, unique stucco art and grill work; the precise alignment of plinths, roof lines and floor lines gave the streets a unique character.”\n\nIndia-based photographer Sebastian Cortés documented the town and its people in his series “Sidhpur: Time Present Time Past.” The images present a certain melancholy, from the faded glory of the mansions’ interiors to the women pictured gazing out of windows as they carry out household chores.\n\n“I was inspired by the mercantile communities of India… who displayed their wealth most aesthetically,” said New York-born Cortés in a phone interview. “This was inverse colonialism: The Bohras traveled around the world to countries like Burma (Myanmar), Thailand, Yemen and Ethiopia, and brought back various influences and then blended it with their own customs and traditions, using local artisans to create magic.”\n\nKadi has also helped bring international attention to the houses by authoring three books about the town: “Sidhpur and Its Dawoodi Bohra Houses,” “The Vohrawaads of Sidhpur” and “The Birth and Death of a Style.”\n\n“At casual glance, the streetscape looks European, but if you look closely there’s the Gujarati tradition of using wood as a building material, and the capitals (crowns of columns or pilasters) are neither Corinthian or Doric but hybrid — a product of various influences,” said Kadi, who now runs an architectural firm in Chennai. “Many of the houses were designed to give women privacy, as most of the men were abroad working hard and making money. (The homes are) also suited to the local weather, in terms of design and materials used.”\n\nThe houses’ names, like Zainab Mansion and Kagalwala Manor, often reference the people who once lived there. There are showstoppers, like the Zaveri house (also known as the House with 365 Windows) which is now stained black with grit, its grand pilasters and geometric facade carvings in dire need of restoration, and the Teen Khuniya (or Three-Cornered House), with its distinctive triangular layout.\n\nAccording to local resident and tour guide Insiya Bangalorewalla, the homes were typically divided into five linear sections: the “dehli” (a service area), the “chowk” (a central courtyard kitchen and bathroom, open to the sky for light and, today, ventilation fitted with grilles), the outer “pursaal” (a multipurpose room for living and dining), the inner “pursaal” (the coolest room, used as a bedroom) and the orda (the best room in the house, well-furnished and used by the head of the family).\n\n“From the street you can’t see into the house thanks to a veil called the ‘furtaal,’ which protected the privacy of the women,” added Bangalorewalla on a tour through Najampura.\n\nThe homes’ interiors were often a visual feast decorated with geometric tiles, friezes, Persian carpets, dark mahogany and rosewood furniture, painted Belgian mirrors, antique corner pieces, family memorabilia and a special marble recess meant for storing water (water has an important status in Islam, and is used to cleanse or purify the home).\n\n“Sidhpur’s architecture is very unique,” said Kadi, “as the buildings inspired by Western ideas and elements have been crafted by Hindu architects (but) are suited to an Islamic way of life.”\n\nOfficial town figures suggest that, in the 1970s, there were at least 1,400 of the mansions across Sidhpur. But after India gained independence from Britain in 1947, many of Sidhpur’s residents migrated overseas, or to larger Indian cities like Mumbai and Ahmedabad, leaving the houses’ upkeep to caretakers or relatives.\n\nToday, many are boarded up, lying forlorn and derelict or caught in legal tangles between former owners’ descendants; others have been demolished to make way for modern developments, with the antiques and timber sold off by owners. The official data suggests that fewer than 400 of Sidhpur’s havelis are currently inhabited.\n\nTo help conserve the disappearing mansions, Kadi, along with others from Sidhpur, co-founded the Sidhpur Heritage Collective in 2024. The group is working to document the town’s architecture, as well as holding workshops and guided tours.\n\n“Unfortunately, there are no heritage laws in India that prevent demolition of (privately owned) houses,” said Kadi. “We also have no funds or body helping us in this project. Even converting these houses into homestays and Airbnbs has not yet taken off.\n\n“(Sidhpur) has a lot to offer besides just these mansions, from a rich food culture to temples and mosques. I can only hope that we manage to save the town’s architecture before it’s destroyed forever.

It was there he met then-student Diller, almost 20 years his junior, and they founded their studio in 1981. (Architect Charles Renfro’s name was added after he became a partner more than two decades later.)\n\nThe duo’s early work was more concerned with the theoretical underpinnings of architecture than the practice itself. Their output through the 1980s and 1990s is best measured in terms of installations, videos and performances, not completed buildings. Yet, the firm’s artistic beginnings laid a conceptual framework for its later forays into the built environment.\n\nAfter completing Slither Housing in 2000, an angular yet gently curved 105-unit apartment building in Japan’s Gifu prefecture, the husband-and-wife team increasingly turned its attentions to cultural architecture. Their Blur Building, a pavilion that appeared to float above Switzerland’s Lake Neuchatel, was considered one of the triumphs of the 2002 Expo, and they soon began building on a greater scale.\n\nThe ambitious Institute of Contemporary Art (ICA) in Boston, opened in 2007, signaled Diller and Scofidio’s arrival as a major architectural force. The first museum to be built in the city in a century, its upper volume hangs dramatically above ground, freeing up space for a generous public waterfront.\n\nThe pair repeated the gesture soon after with the Juilliard School and Alice Tully Hall (both at the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts in New York), effectively removing a corner of the latter’s angular structure to create more space for the busy Manhattan intersection below.\n\nIt was, however, New York’s High Line that propelled Diller and Scofidio into mainstream consciousness: In 2009, the year its first phase opened to the public, the pair were named among Time magazine’s 100 most influential people. Completed alongside landscape architect James Corner and garden designer Piet Oudolf, the project transformed an abandoned freight train line into a 1.5-mile-long linear park on Manhattan’s West Side.\n\nDespite its ambitious size, the elevated park’s design is often celebrated for the quiet moments enjoyed traveling its length — the diverse garden zones, the picnic spots, sunken benches overlooking a framed vista of the traffic below. Describing his approach in a 2012 documentary about the project, Scofidio said: “The first time I came up here, I discovered the plants were incredibly opportunistic. Where there was sun, you had one kind of grass that was growing; where there was shade, you had a different plant that was growing. When we started thinking about the design, we realized that we could be as opportunistic as the plants.”\n\nThe project sparked both a global craze for elevated walkways and — thanks in part to the re-zoning its creation necessitated — a building boom in its corner of Manhattan. Diller Scofidio + Renfro proved to be one of the beneficiaries when it was commissioned to design The Shed, a monolithic cultural center at the nearby Hudson Yards development that opened, to mixed reviews, in 2019.\n\nThe firm’s other major museum projects include the United States Olympic & Paralympic Museum in Colorado Springs and The Broad in LA (both its original design and a major expansion project set to complete by 2028). Diller Scofidio + Renfro also completed a formidable $450 million revamp of New York’s Museum of Modern Art (MoMa), which increased its gallery space by 30%.\n\nScofidio’s legacy will remain intertwined with that of his Polish-born wife, who often served as the firm’s public face. (In 2018 she was once again named in the Time 100 list, this time without her husband.) Yet, he was known for his imaginative vision and technical problem-solving, quietly driving the firm’s creative vision from behind the scenes.\n\n“I’ve become what I consider to be the troubleshooter,” he told the New York Times in an interview in 2019. “When there are snags or hang-ups, I’ll work to find a solution.”', '', 'Published 3:26 AM EST, Fri March 7, 2025', 'ricardo-scofidio-architect-of-new-yorks-high-line-dies-age-89-1745808799'),

Fittingly then, it didn’t take long before the building became the site of a landmark event in the story of modern Africa.\n\nJust over two years later, Selassie once again made the climb to welcome the founding members of the newly formed Organization of African Unity (OAU) to their home — a meeting place intended to foster cooperation, drive economic progress and eradicate colonialism across the continent.\n\nAddressing representatives of the then-32 independent African states, Selassie declared that the continent was “at midcourse, in transition from the Africa of yesterday to the Africa of tomorrow.”\n\n“We must act to shape and mold the future and leave our imprint on events as they slip past into history,” he continued.\n\nMore than 60 years later, Selassie’s message has come full-circle: Africa Hall has been shaped and molded anew.\n\nLast October marked the completion of a decade-long renovation across the entirety of the 12,800 square-meter site, commissioned by the ECA in 2013 with a $57 million budget to revitalize the landmark as a world-class conference and cultural venue.\n\nAustralian design practice Architectus Conrad Gargett was entrusted with leading the re-design, giving project architect Simon Boundy a mission with dual themes — modernization and conservation.\n\n“The two go hand-in-hand with projects like this,” Boundy told CNN, “Where you’ve got an aging asset, but if it doesn’t get used, it falls into disrepair.”\n\n“It’s about bringing the building back to life, making it accessible to the public and celebrating the story of the building for future generations.”\n\nThe conundrum for Boundy and his team was that those two aims threatened to undermine the historical significance of Africa Hall. In essence, how do you modernize a historical landmark without losing some of its soul?\n\nAs a heritage architect — regularly tasked with making sensitive changes to buildings of historical or cultural importance — Boundy is well-versed in answering that question.\n\nThe first step was understanding Africa Hall’s importance and history, which was aided by hiring local architects and engineers to work on the renovation. Among them was Mewded Wolde, who, a day before her university graduation in 2014, found herself on the roof of Africa Hall taking measurements.\n\nBorn and raised in Addis Ababa, Wolde says the building — which hosted OAU meetings until the organization was replaced by the African Union (AU) in 2002, which eventually moved into new headquarters in Addis Ababa — is a source of pride for herself and many others given its role in helping countries across the continent achieve independence from colonial rule.\n\n“This building, still for the African Union, is a symbol,” Wolde told CNN.\n\n“It’s an artwork in itself that symbolizes the struggle that we have gone through in the past 60, 70 years to get to African unity.”\n\nLocal knowledge helped Boundy navigate the “balancing act” of modernizing Africa Hall without devaluing its legacy. Roughly 13 million new tiles were fabricated and reinstalled to exactly match the original material, staying true to the brown, orange and off-white color palette of Mezzedimi’s modernist design.\n\nThe old layout of the Plenary Hall was deemed to lack seating space, so after consulting the building’s original architectural drawings, the team designed new furniture in the same style and added an extra ring of seating.\n\nHidden in each desk is a digital screen, a subtle addition that — along with the arrival of a 13-meter-wide (42-foot-wide) LED display — leaves Africa Hall well suited to meet the technological requirements of modern conference hosting, while preserving the original architecture.\n\n“We don’t want to leave our mark on the building,” Boundy said. “We want to just bring the original design to life again and hopefully everything that we do is behind the scenes, concealed in the ceilings, and it’s not the feature.”\n\nSome aspects, however, demanded more radical change, especially those concerning accessibility and safety. The building — “quite dilapidated” — was stripped back to its structural core and strengthened with carbon fiber and steel before being built up again, Boundy explained, to protect the concrete from the damage caused by rusting steel and the threat of seismic activity.\n\nProtective measures also included a strengthened frame for the crown jewel of Africa Hall: the two-story stained-glass window that has adorned the foyer since 1961.\n\nTitled “The Total Liberation of Africa,” it was Ethiopian artist Afewerk Tekle’s signature piece and is split into three panels; Africa Then, Africa Then and Now, and Africa Now and in the Future.\n\nFeaturing a knight in shining armor emblazoned with the UN logo, a dragon and the grim reaper, the work tells a story of liberation, of “slaying the demons” of colonization, Boundy explained.\n\nTekle’s work is Africa Hall’s definitive symbol, and can be seen splashed across shirts, ties and more in the city.\n\n“The symbolism of the artwork is something that’s really hard to overstate, how important that is,” Boundy said.\n\n“It really tells the story of what Africa Hall is trying to represent, which is the very best of what Africa can do, quite literally shedding the recent history, and looking very much forward … You can sit and spend hours staring at it.”\n\nWith various original pieces either loose or missing, the entire artwork was meticulously disassembled, cleaned and restored panel-by-panel by Emmanuel Thomas, the grandson of the person who originally made the stained glass from Tekle’s design.\n\nIts refreshed look was unveiled alongside a new permanent exhibition to highlight the key events at Africa Hall that have helped to shape Pan-African history. For Wolde, both the artwork and the renovation itself are reflective of Selassie’s 1963 address, where he spoke of molding the Africa of tomorrow.\n\n“Even now, even with all the upgrades that have happened in Africa Hall, this quote is actually true,” Wolde said.\n\n“This is the space that we’re going to use to shape the future. Even then it was where they were having meetings … to shape the future of Africa, and even now, it symbolizes that.

Named after St. Peter, who was a fisherman and, according to the Catholic tradition, the first pope, it was worn by Pope Francis to ceremonial events throughout his 12-year reign. Countless devoted followers kissed it. It even sparked a controversy over hygiene.\n\nNow, as tradition dictates, the late pontiff’s signet ring will be destroyed — or defaced, at least — within the walls of the Vatican following his death, aged 88, on Easter Monday.\n\nIt is a ritual with practical roots. The Fisherman’s Ring and a pendant called the bulla traditionally served as official seals for official letters and documents known as papal briefs. New ones were issued to each incoming pope, and to prevent letters or decrees being forged posthumously, both would be smashed with a hammer upon his death. From 1521 until 2013, this is precisely what happened.\n\n“It’s the equivalent of taking the login details away from a social media account,” said Christopher Lamb, CNN’s Vatican correspondent. “That’s what it was about — it was to stop pretenders using false seals on documents.”\n\nBy convention, the Camerlengo of the Holy Roman Church, a senior cardinal appointed to oversee the transition, would destroy the ring and bulla in the presence of the College of Cardinals after announcing the pope’s passing.\n\nThis practice continued long after the objects ceased to be used as seals (they were functionally replaced by a stamp in the mid-19th century). But when Francis’ predecessor Pope Benedict XVI became the first ever ﻿pope to resign in six centuries, a new tradition was established: A deep cross was carved into the ring’s surface with a chisel.\n\n“I think there was a feeling that it was unnecessary to destroy the ring,” said Lamb, who suggested the threat of papal impersonation had grown less and less likely over the years.\n\nCurrent Camerlengo Kevin Joseph Farrell, the Irish cardinal appointed to the role by Francis in 2023, is expected to follow suit and deface the ring ahead of the papal conclave — the process by which the next pope will be selected.\n\nAlthough steeped in ritual and symbolic of papal authority, the signet ring’s role has varied greatly from pontiff to pontiff.\n\nIn this regard, Francis deviated from some of his recent predecessors. Some pontiffs, such as Pope Benedict XVI, opted for daily wear, while Pope John Paul II often wore an alternative ring (or a ring-shaped crucifix) as a facsimile of sorts.\n\nFrancis fell somewhere in between: He wore his Fisherman’s Ring﻿ to official ceremonies, though for daily use he switched it for a simple silver ring dating from his time as cardinal.\n\nThere was also some speculation that Francis was uncomfortable with the act of kissing the ring: In early 2019, he was filmed repeatedly pulling his hand away as followers attempted to do so, though the Vatican later said he had intended to reduce the spread of germs.\n\nAccording to Lamb, Francis always liked to meet people where they were — shaking hands or embracing those who were distressed — and was not someone who expected people to kneel and kiss his ring when meeting him.\n\nFisherman’s Rings have differed through the centuries. While most of them featured an image of Saint Peter and the keys of the Holy See — evoking the moment he was given the keys to heaven — little else governs their design. As such, they have often reflected the fashions of the day or the ethos of the pope in question.\n\nThey are typically hand-made for the incoming pope by a goldsmith, though Pope Francis bucked the trend with a “recycled” ring, according to Lamb. In keeping with the late pope’s modest approach, Francis chose not to commission the creation of a new piece, but instead “used a ring from the secretary of Paul VI,” said Lamb.\n\nThe “in-possession ring,” as it is referred to by the Vatican, was once owned by Paul VI’s secretary, Archbishop Pasquale Macchi, who died in 2006. It was made from gold-plated silver, rather than pure gold.\n\nThe ring’s fate following the conclave, like many questions surrounding the secretive selection process, remains to be seen.', 'To kiss or not to kiss', 'Published 6:01 AM EDT, Tue April 22, 2025', 'why-pope-francis-signet-ring-will-be-destroyed-following-his-death-1745808799'),

(Hook was overheard saying that the first thing her character, Piper Ratliff, wears in the show is, as it happens, a Ralph Lauren dress.)\n\nActors Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Michelle Williams, Naomi Watts, Ariana Debose, and Eiza Gonzalez were also in attendance.\n\nLauren’s chosen venue — Jack Shainman Gallery — echoed golden age Gotham, with its marble columns, towering windows, and coffered ceilings. Here, Lauren’s fall 2025 womenswear designs glimmered with the spirit of family heirlooms in the making: a collection meant to last the ages and, importantly, to appeal to all ages.\n\nSpeaking to CNN ahead of the show, Lauren explained that the collection, titled “The Modern Romantics”, was “a celebration of individual style and timeless sophistication,” with “each piece reflect(ing) the confidence of a woman who defines style on her own terms.”\n\nThe result was a mash-up of Ralph Lauren signatures that felt broodier, a little more bohemian, and, in that, perhaps a touch more eclectic. See the Victorian or Edwardian collars beneath barn jackets, outerwear that juxtaposed finished leather and brushed suede (these were excellent), leather bustiers styled with riding boots, and frilly dresses with dark floral prints (instead of Lauren’s usual palette of off-white, cream and equine brown).

The luxury sector is grappling with some of its slowest growth in years, as well as US President Trump’s quickly evolving tariff plans, which threaten to drive up clothing prices.\n\nOver a phone call with CNN a few days before the show, Patrice Louvet, CEO and president of Ralph Lauren Corporation, acknowledged the “relatively volatile” environment. Emphasizing Ralph Lauren’s resilience, he noted that throughout 2024 the brand “saw strong responses across generations.”\n\nLouvet has been focused on maintaining a constant presence in customers’ lives by translating the well-developed Ralph Lauren ethos — one of good-life Americana — into experiences that can be enjoyed by a greater number of people. Younger age groups, he noted, are a focus.\n\nRalph’s Coffee, which has outposts in over 35 locations including New York, London, Beijing, Doha and Tokyo, reaches 4 million people a year, according to Louvet. “The population that’s consuming Ralph’s is disproportionately younger consumers,” he added. These patrons are likely drawn by the cafés’ Instagram-friendly feel, with its preppy green-striped branding and playful merchandise, including oversized stuffed animal Polo bears in situ, which make for great pictures.\n\nSports have also been key in broadening Ralph Lauren’s cultural relevance. The brand regularly invests in sponsorships and partnerships that range from baseball activations in Japan to support for tennis and golf via the US Open, Wimbledon and the Ryder Cup. It will also be a title sponsor at the upcoming Winter Olympics in Milan and Cortina, Italy, as it was at the 2024 Summer Games in Paris, France.\n\n“We’re making sure we engage with the younger generation while continuing to delight and surprise our 30-year-olds, our 50-year-olds, our 80-year-olds,” said Louvet. “It’s one of the challenges (we constantly pose) to our marketing team.”\n\nConsistency is key, he believes. “(Other brands) kind of have moments, and then (they) go quiet.

The style’s humble beginnings instead date back to 1571, when England’s parliament passed a law requiring all working-class men to wear woolen hats on Sundays and holidays, or risk a fine, according to British hatmaker Hicks & Brown. The caps proved popular with dockworkers, shipwrights and bandits, and, over time, the baker boy hat became synonymous with the newsboy cap (which was actually worn by boys working at newsstands).\n\nThough Kate’s choice of headgear has been called “divisive” by Vogue and a “Dickensian fashion moment” by Elle Australia, she’s in good company: Kendall Jenner was spotted walking the streets of New York City in a baker boy hat earlier this year and Anne Hathaway opted for the throwback look in Paris in 2023.\n\nNever one to shy away from an outfit repeat, the Princess of Wales also appeared to sport the exact jacket she wore in the controversial edited family photo amid speculation about her health following abdominal surgery last year (she subsequently revealed her cancer diagnosis a few weeks later).

Within minutes, the huge coat was whisked away — revealing a reptilian bodysuit covered in head-to-toe scales. “She’s the reptilian villain,” said the look’s designer, Asher Levine, in a video call from his studio in Los Angeles. “It’s very creature couture.”\n\nLevine, who has created otherworldly stage-wear for Lady Gaga, Grace Jones, Doja Cat, Christina Aguilera and Grimes, got the call to create both of Lisa’s technologically advanced Coachella looks less than a month before her performance date. “We’ve been going for a week and a half, day and night,” he told CNN in the days leading up to the event. “I went to bed early last night for this interview.”\n\nFor her custom 3D reptile suit, Levine first took a body scan of the K-pop star to capture her precise measurements, which he then uploaded to a digital tailoring system which enables him to drape and adjust textiles on Lisa’s virtual avatar before the outfit goes into production. Next, he designed a unique geometric scale print using AI, and then passed the two-dimensional textile design onto his studio’s sculpture division to handcraft each individual scute — mimicking a lizard’s interlocking scales. The designer, who calls himself a “leather industry disruptor,” hopes to one day create cruelty-free versions of leather goods and exotic skins such as crocodiles and alligators.\n\n“We don’t have to kill animals anymore,” he said. “We can evolve beyond that.”\n\nEven with the aid of digital tools, the reptilian costume took meticulous work over a handful of days, with the smallest details, such as the translucent scales and horns that sat on Lisa’s shoulders, each taking between 50 and 60 hours to make.\n\nFor Lisa’s second performance look — an ethereal sheer catsuit complete with glowing 3-D- printed blue and pink tendrils — Levine looked to another area of nature for inspiration.\n\n“A lot of the references were bioluminescent insects (and) translucent fungi with illuminated veins running through the petals,” said Levine. “People have been putting nature on themselves for thousands of years: flowers, animal prints. But now (I’m thinking) what’s exotic 2.0?”\n\nFor Levine, that approach meant fusing prehistoric creatures with futuristic technology — something he’s done before with his Terrelli clutch bag, which was inspired by the 300-million-year-old extinct fish Dunkleosteus Terrelli.\n\n“What I like to do with my designs is create chimeric organisms (and build) a new, evolved, exotic extension of this character,” he explained.\n\nEach of the 20-something luminescent tendrils worn by Lisa featured a fiber optic light that created an extra-terrestrial glow.\n\n“We started experimenting with embedded illumination in 2011,” said Levine, recalling a project a decade earlier with the Grammy-winning artist Will.i.am. “He was like, ‘Can you embed lights in clothes?’ And me being very enthusiastic said, ‘Yeah, let’s figure it out.’”\n\nSince then, he’s hooked Gaga, Aguilera and Grimes up to featherweight lights for a variety of shows, and has perfected his use of flexible, glass-like materials for built-in luminosity. For her Coachella performance, Lisa wore a series of clear petals across her chest that “looked like glass but bent like leather,” said Levine, holding a petal up to the camera and manipulating it with his hands to demonstrate. “This is the future that Blade Runner predicted.”\n\nOne of the biggest challenges for Levine is producing a technologically advanced outfit that allows high-octane artists to move freely. After all, these are not static looks, such as those that might feature in a magazine editorial. “Building these pieces for a performance is literally like building for a sports athlete,” he explained.\n\nHowever, Levine recognizes that a second-skin scaly bodysuit may only appeal to specific entertainers, but so far, he’s found likeminded clients who seek to push boundaries not only with their work but also in their style.\n\n“These are the kinds of people that I’ve been focused on evolving,” he continued. “That’s who my customer is. You’re the other, you’re avant-garde. Asher Levine isn’t for everyone.”', 'Illuminating inspiration', 'Updated 6:50 AM EDT, Sat April 12, 2025', 'exclusive-meet-the-designer-behind-lisas-reptilian-coachella-look-1745808799'),

From Victoria and David Beckham’s memorable matching leather ensembles in 1999 to Britney Spears and Justin Timberlake’s iconic double denim attire in 2001, numerous stars have synchronized their wardrobes to express their relationship status.\n\nThe latest couple to embrace the matchy-matchy trend is actress and singer Selena Gomez and record producer Benny Blanco. Newly engaged and fresh from releasing a new album, “I Said I Love You First”, marking their first project as a couple, the pop music duo was spotted in coordinated western outfits as they arrived at Madison Square Garden in New York to watch the Knicks vs. Celtics basketball game on Tuesday.\n\nGomez and Blanco looked like a mirror image of each other as they wore matching camel-colored, calf-skimming coats and low-heeled cowboy-style boots. But they also added individual touches to their looks: Gomez opted for classic pieces including blue jeans and a black handbag, while Blanco ditched his typical rainbow colors for a pair of cow-print pants and a striped baby blue and white Coors Rodeo work shirt. During the game, the couple sat courtside and posed affectionately for the jumbotron.\n\nThe approach to joint dressing was not a departure from the norm for Gomez and Blanco, who first met in 2015 when Blanco co-produced Gomez’s single “Same Old Love.” Last December, they announced their engagement on Instagram, with Gomez showing off her glittering Marquise-cut diamond ring. Since then, the pair have appeared together publicly at several high-profile events, including the 82nd Annual Golden Globes in January, where Gomez wore a pastel blue off-the-shoulder gown alongside Blanco in a harmoniously pale white suit. In February, they appeared on the cover of Interview Magazine, clad in matching pinstripe zoot-suits; Gomez in full-glam makeup and Blanco nestling dotingly onto her shoulder with his usual groomed scruff.\n\nThe couple also made a stylish appearance at the 2025 Oscars in March, with Gomez dazzling in a custom Ralph Lauren gown, featuring over 16,000 drops of glass and hand-sewn Rosemont crystals, and Blanco opting for a white suit and diamond brooch instead of a tie. Both exuded an air of old Hollywood glamour, though Blanco later commented on “The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon” that Gomez deserved “a medal of honor” for her glamorous effort. Meanwhile, he joked that he “looked like a slob” in comparison.\n\nWhile that was far from the case, it appears that Blanco never misses the opportunity to praise Gomez. That’s evident on his TikTok account, which often features him cooking for her, prompting some followers to endearingly joke that his page has become a Gomez fan account.\n\nMatching fashion isn’t limited to celebrity couples. Used to signify compatibility, it’s a trend that has recently taken off on TikTok, where there are thousands of videos of everyday couples showing off coordinated looks.\n\n“Especially when (a couple gets) married, they start to present as one unit,” Jay Yoo, associate professor in the department of human sciences and design at Baylor University in Texas, told CNN over a phone call. “Individual identity is now the negotiated identity.”\n\nBased on his research of married couples, Yoo said merging styles is often the result of a growing identification between partners as well as an effort to convey an alignment of status. For this reason, a lot of attention is paid to how famous couples dress, as fans eagerly look out for potential indicators of the state of their relationships. If dressing alike is interpreted as a sign of solidarity, celebrity couples with mismatched styles are viewed by some observers as being less emotionally connected.\n\nJustin and Hailey Bieber have on multiple occasions appeared dressed for seemingly opposite occasions. For the promotional launch of a new lip gloss for Hailey’s beauty brand Rhode last September, she stepped out in a red strapless mini dress and heels while Justin followed closely behind in gray sweats, crocs and a pink cap.\n\nKylie Jenner and Timothée Chalamet have also sported starkly different looks since being romantically linked, in 2023. At the Santa Barbara International Film Festival in February, Jenner stuck to her sultry style, wearing a black halter-neck dress, while Chalamet wore a lime-green printed shirt with jeans and sneakers. In the same month, the couple attended the Berlin International Film Festival, once again wearing wildly disparate outfits; Jenner in a shimmery black dress with a sweetheart neckline and Chalamet in a cotton candy pink tank top and hoodie.\n\nThese appearances have led some fans to speculate on the stars’ compatibility. Yet, while a coordinated aesthetic can be satisfying to the eye, there has also been a well-documented number of separations among A-listers despite their aligned approach to dressing, suggesting that a shared wardrobe might not be the best signifier of a relationship’s success.\n\nLike most things in life, it’s about finding balance, and while there’s no harm in twinning with your significant other, Gomez and Blanco’s love-lassoed look perhaps reveals the key to doing it tastefully: embrace common ground but stay true to your differences.', 'Is twinning the key to winning?', 'Published 6:49 AM EDT, Fri April 11, 2025', 'look-of-the-week-selena-gomez-and-benny-blancos-love-language-is-matching-looks-1745808799'),

Perched inside a clam shell and surrounded by figures from the original painting, DeGeneres created her own “Birth of Venus” for the promotional print poster — subbing out nudity for a more signature white pantsuit. (Both HBO and CNN share the parent company Warner Bros. Discovery).\n\nThree years later, for a magazine advertisement, the now-defunct British car brand Scion decided to reproduce Damien Hirst’s controversial sculpture “The Physical Impossibility of Death in the Mind of Someone Living” (1991) by suspending their XII model in a tank of seafoam green formaldehyde. In the same decade, there was a surprisingly artistic print artwork for the sixth season of the popular 2005 CBS TV show “CSI: Crime Scene Investigation”. In the ad, cast members gaze through the window of a neon-lit diner lifted straight out of American painter Edward Hopper’s seminal painting “Nighthawks” (1942).\n\nEach of the campaigns may appear to have little in common, but they reveal an unmistakable truth about the advertising industry: before digital marketing became the norm, overtaking print in terms of revenue and budget allocation, there was arguably more room for complex, creative and daring image-making. Jim Heimann, graphic designer, historian and the editor of the forthcoming book “All-American Ads of the 2000s” — available in the UK from April 14 and in the US a month later — is worried these might be the last of their kind. “Print is slowly disappearing. That’s a problem,” he said.\n\nLike a skilled archaeologist, Heimann has spent his life hunting down and preserving American cultural relics, such as cocktail napkins collected while researching the country’s penchant for drive-in restaurants to travel brochures from the early 20th century.\n\nA fixture at Sunday flea markets for the last 50 years, Heimann finds they are a good location to scour for magazines — often the first thing to go following a home clearout, he said. He normally turns to eBay to source specific ads, despite the added cost, and takes care to cherry pick from across pop culture, selecting the most artfully designed campaigns for top movies, popular games and even beloved cereal brands, among others. With each decision, he’s thinking: “What would I want to revisit 20 years from now?”\n\nIn 2000, Heimann was commissioned by Taschen to create a series of books that mapped the visual fluctuations of the advertising industry. He started with the 1950s, a post-war period often referred to as the golden age of capitalism in the US, sourcing John Wayne-fronted Camel ads, glossy Cadillac double-page spreads and kitschy lingerie illustrations. Then he went back to the ‘30s, the ‘40s and jumped forward to the ‘60s, following each decade until the last tome cataloging the Wild West of the ‘90s hit the shelves in 2022. This edition on the aughts, however, will likely conclude the collection. “We had a discussion about doing 2010 to 2020,” Heimann told CNN in a video call. “But the material just isn’t there anymore.”\n\nChronicling the earlier part of the decade has proved difficult. As the book’s foreword by Steven Heller, former senior art director of the New York Times, reads: “Advertising did not change when the Times Square ball fell at the stroke of midnight on January 1, 2000, but the industry began its creative decline in the 2000s” — a period when digital advertising was starting to creep in. When Google launched its AdWords platform in 2000, small businesses could eschew forking out for expensive visual campaigns and instead promote themselves on Google’s search results page with text-based adverts. By 2001, television had surpassed newspapers in terms of ad revenue for the first time in the US.\n\nThese developments mark “the end of a century of advertising,” said Heimann.\n\nFor Heimann, ads offer insight into the values and aspirations as well as political and economic environments of a generation. On compiling them in the book, he explained: “We always have a staple of 10 categories, but we expand them according to the decades. For instance, in the 1940s we had to expand war-related ads. They were really predominant, all these companies that were no longer producing automobiles or tires were doing everything for the war effort.”\n\nIn the aughts, many of the ads were focused on technology. “The tech world just blew up,” Heimann said. “Everything fell into that (category) consistently.” It was the 10-year-period that saw the invention of the first ever iPhone, the iMac, the iBook, the MacBook, the iPad, the iPod, iPod Nano and iPod Mini — and that’s just Apple. Heimann also found old Motorola, Blackberry, Sony and Nokia ads, along with a slew of brands that are no longer in existence.\n\nAmid a shift in societal attitudes towards sexuality and sexual freedom, the concept of “sex sells” became a common marketing strategy in the ‘70s — so much so that it would be difficult to tell the difference between a Dolce & Gabbana campaign and an ad for Durex, said Heimann. Sexual marketing imagery continues to be prevalent, despite advertising’s changing tides (see Jeremy Allen White’s racy Calvin Klein underwear campaign in 2024, which Heimann sought to collect but failed to find a print copy, even after searching through 15 men’s magazines at his local newsstand).\n\nIn a Gucci ad from 2002, a topless male model is photographed side-on, undoing the monogrammed belt of his ‘G’ embroidered jeans — the leather strap in-hand creating a “sophomoric suggestion of an enhanced male appendage,” wrote Heller in the book. A Tom Ford menswear shoot Heimann preserved from 2008 shows an entirely naked female model grabbing the crotch of a suited man. “Females are always exploited,” he pointed out. “But to the extent of how they exploit women just becomes (implausible).”\n\nAt least the French brand Sisley somewhat evened the score, with an advert of a nude man saddled up and being ridden by a fully clothed woman. Still, to Heimann, this level of sexualization is “toned down” compared to the material he has collected from the ‘80s and ‘90s. “Now, we’ve got this new era of hyper masculinity,” Heimann said, referring to Trump’s hypermasculine campaign messaging that called for a return of gender roles, as well as the rise of “manosphere” influencers such as Andrew Tate and Joe Rogan, who push male-supremacist viewpoints and call for the subservience of women on platforms such as YouTube. “Where’s that going to take us?” he questioned.\n\nBetween the leaps in AI technology and the new US administration, Heimann has questions not only on what adverts in the future might look like, but also who might be making them in the first place. It’s unlikely advertisers will want to spend on an agency to deliver a campaign when they can create them using AI for a fraction of the price. A recent study conducted by the University of Oxford suggests that AI-generated advertising images performed more effectively than human-made ones, as long as the images used do not look like artificial intelligence.\n\n“Where will that creative world go?” Heimann mused. “It’ll have to play out, but it doesn’t bode well.” A fixation on cutting costs might only become greater in light of President Donald Trump’s anti-European initiatives and the recently announced 25% tariffs on imported cars among other products. “How do you sell a car that’s 25% more (expensive) than another car?” Heimann asked. “Who’s going to buy a Subaru (or) a Volvo (if they) charge 25% more than an American car?”\n\nFor Heimann, advertisements of the last two decades have been selling a steady version of the American Dream. “In the ‘90s and the early 2000s, advertising still has that same cadence to it. The population looks the same, the automobiles look the same,” he said. Now, Heimann thinks that as America continues to evolve, more monumental changes will come in the years ahead. “I’ve been asked the question, ‘Did 9/11 affect advertising and how people perceived it?’ I think there was a little bump (in the road)… But I think what’s happening currently is going to be much more impactful,” he said.\n\n“All-American Ads of the 2000s”, published by Taschen, is available in the UK now, and in the US from May 14.', '‘The material isn’t there anymore’', 'Published 2:51 AM EDT, Mon April 14, 2025', 'what-the-best-ads-of-the-2000s-reveal-about-american-culture-1745808799'),

While Hahn was in New York for the garden build, the two began to discuss an idea over dinner. “I said, ‘Martha, what do you think about having your own rose?’. And she said, ‘Amazing, I would love that’,” explained Hahn.\n\nCreating a new rose is a massive undertaking — from inception to market usually takes years. So, while Stewart’s involvement in the project began a few years ago, the rose named after her has been around a decade in the making.\n\nThe creation of a rose begins by considering “the traits you want” the flower to have, explained Consulting Rosarian (a certified expert in rose care) and independent hybridizer Christopher Huffer, before choosing your parent plants with those traits. Once the parents are crossed through the pollination process, seeds will form in rose hips (the seed pods of roses) with each seed having the potential to become a new rose. Then there are years of testing before a potential new rose can ever be sold commercially.\n\nHahn is no stranger to working with celebrities. She and her father Lorenzo Dall’Armi collaborated with chef and author Julia Child when Child decided to pick the now iconic yellow rose to be her namesake. Stewart, meanwhile, already has a number of plants carrying her name including a begonia, a daffodil and an orchid. But to have a rose named after you is “a really big honor,” said Hahn. “And for people who love roses, it is the highest honor”.\n\nFinding the perfect rose to become Martha’s namesake was difficult according to Hahn, who visited various fields and looked at dozens of contenders. When searching for the right rose, there are a number of factors to consider, including color. Stewart has a “very defined color palette,” said Hahn, “but anything in like the medium-pink to peach, to apricot, even a creamy apricot, I think she would have been open to.”\n\nBut the search ended when they came across a compact hybrid tea in Martha’s preferred color palette at Star Roses and Plants, an American horticultural company involved in plant breeding, distribution and intellectual property. What would become the Martha Stewart rose was first sent to the United States as a test rose called CP 15 8603 in December 2015, one of many sent by European rose breeding company Meilland International for evaluation.\n\n“On average, it’s maybe 150 codes (roses) we get from them every year,” Kristen Smith, a rose evaluation manager for Star Roses and Plants, told CNN. But Meilland is just one of the rose breeders the company works with. On average, it looks at close to 700 roses annually, according to Smith.\n\nAfter entering the US, roses are placed in a two-year quarantine period before testing begins. During the testing phase roses are reviewed for certain criteria, including growth and development in different weather conditions, as well as disease resistance. The rose that would become Stewart’s was placed at Star Roses’ testing fields in Pennsylvania and California.\n\nIn 2021, as it became apparent that CP 15 8603 was special, the Star Roses team decided to patent it. “At that time, we hadn’t necessarily 100% decided to introduce it, but we knew that it was an important variety,” said Susan Bacus Morgan, marketing manager for Star Roses and Plants.\n\n“On average, it’s about five varieties that are going in to the catalog every year,” said Smith, meaning that on average less than 1% of the roses tested make it into Star’s portfolio annually. “It’s a really long and loving process to launch a rose,” said Morgan. “We want to release the very best.”\n\nWhile many people had a hand in finding the perfect rose to carry Stewart’s name, it was ultimately Martha’s choice. “Martha personally chose and approved the rose,” confirmed a spokesperson from a public relations agency that represents Stewart, in an email to CNN.\n\n“I am so happy that such a great rose is named after me and that many of you will be adding it to your garden!”, said Stewart in an Instagram post on her verified account last week. Stewart also thanked Hahn who “worked with me for two years to make this happen”.\n\nWhile new to the North American market, this same rose has been available since 2021 in Europe, where it is known as “Jean de la Fontaine.”\n\n“Oftentimes a rose introduced in Europe will receive a different name in America,” said Morgan. When choosing a name for commercial use, cultivators pick “something to catch people’s attention,” said Beth Smiley, publications director of the American Rose Society. “The Martha Stewart rose is going to attract a lot of attention”.\n\nThere is no “financial benefit for having a rose named after you — absolutely zero,” said Hahn. In a statement provided to CNN, Star Roses said: “This rose has been named in honor of Martha Stewart, recognizing her extraordinary contributions to lifestyle, design, homemaking, and gardening… Our hope is that this rose will honor her legacy and serve as a source of inspiration for generations to come.”\n\nWhile there are only a limited number of Martha Stewart rose plants are available for pre-order, if you miss out this year, the variety is expected to be available at independent garden centers in 2026.\n\nAs a repeat bloomer, you can expect the Martha Stewart rose to flower in flushes through the growing season. Smith said that while the rose has performed well in hot, dry climates like California, “it does get some leaf spot in areas that are more susceptible to fungal diseases, but it is better than older varieties of hybrid tea types.”\n\nBut it’s the scent that’s the standout for this plant. “It’s not a traditional rose fragrance,” said Hahn. “It’s fruitier, it’s light, it’s luscious. You feel like you could eat it.”', '', 'Updated 7:42 PM EST, Thu January 23, 2025', 'now-you-can-have-martha-stewart-in-your-garden-1745808799'),

At 11:59 p.m. a dazzling ball descends down a pole, while attendees — and millions of people tuning in from home — count down from 60. At the stroke of midnight, the crowd erupts into a cacophony of sound, often pulling their loved one in for a ceremonial kiss.\n\nBut how did this New Year’s Eve celebration start, and why do we commemorate the occasion by watching a ball descend down a pole?\n\nThe Times Square ball first dropped in 1904, and it came into being thanks to Jacob Starr, a Ukranian immigrant and metalworker, and the former New York Times publisher, Adolph Ochs. The latter had successfully drawn crowds to the newspaper’s skyscraper home in Times Square with pyrotechnics and fireworks to celebrate the forthcoming year, but city officials banned explosives from being used after just a few years of the festivities.\n\nSo Ochs commissioned Starr, who worked for sign-making firm Strauss Signs (later known as Artkraft Strauss, a company at which Starr served as president), to create a new visual display.\n\nOver the past century, that display, and symbol of the New Year has evolved from a iron and wood cage adorned with light bulbs to a dazzling technicolor crystal sphere.\n\nTheir concept was based on time balls, nautical devices that had gained popularity in the 19th century. As time-telling became more precise, ship navigators needed a standardized way to set their chronometers. Each day, harbors and observatories would raise and lower a metal ball at the same time to allow sailors to synchronize their instruments.\n\nBoth Ochs and the New York Times’ chief electrician, Walter Palmer, have been credited with the idea, allegedly inspired by the downtown Western Union Building, which dropped a time ball each day at noon. But Starr’s granddaughter Tama, who joined Artkraft Strauss in 1982 and now owns the business, said in a phone interview that she believes it was her grandfather who came up with the concept of the ball being lowered and lit up with the new year numerals at midnight.\n\n“The idea was to … have it illuminated with the brand-new electricity that had just come up to the neighborhood,” said Tama, who for many years served as foreperson at the Times Square ball drop. “And it was lowered by hand … starting at one minute to midnight, and that was the way it was done for many years.”\n\n“It was an adaptation of an old, useful thing,” she added. “It was instantly popular. People just loved it.”\n\nThough Manhattan had been partially illuminated by electricity since the early 1880s, the US National Park Service (NPS) notes that half of American homes were still lit by gas lights and candles until the 1920s. The sight of a glimmering ball lowering down from the dark skies would have seemed otherworldly.\n\nWhen the ball reached the parapet with a sign displaying the numbers of the year, “the electrician would throw the switch, turning off the ball and turning on the numbers at the same time,” Tama said. “So it looked like the ball coming down transformed into the set of numbers.”\n\nAll of Times Square got in on the theatrics. In the first year, waiters in nearby restaurants and hotels wore battery-powered “1908” top hats that they illuminated at the stroke of midnight.\n\n“It looked like magic to people,” said Tama.\n\nThere have been seven different Times Square balls since that first descent, from a 700-pound iron structure fitted with 25-watt light bulbs, to a lighter aluminum frame after World War II, to a “Big Apple” during the administration of the city’s former mayor Ed Koch.\n\nIn 1995, when the ball got a glitzy update with rhinestones, strobe lights and computer controls, traditional signmakers were no longer needed — which meant that Artkraft Strauss, the company that had brought the ball to Times Square, was no longer needed either. Today’s ball is a collaboration between Waterford Crystal and Philips Lighting, using 32,256 LEDs that can be programed to display millions of colors and patterns on its surface.\n\nNonetheless, Tama remembers her years as the timekeeper on the roof of One Times Square fondly.\n\nWhen the last minute of the year arrived, workers lowered the ball down using a complex pulley system.\n\nIn performing this ritual year after year, Tama sees an intrinsic link between the countdown, which she calls “a minute outside of time,” and the making of New Year’s resolutions.\n\n“When you’re concentrating really hard, time seems to slow down,” she said. “It felt like the longest minute in the world. It felt like you had time to wash your hair, call your mother, change your life. You really can change your life in one minute — you can decide to be different. You can decide to be kinder and better.”', 'When was the first ball drop in Times Square?', 'Published 5:00 AM EST, Tue December 31, 2024', 'a-brief-history-of-the-times-square-new-years-eve-ball-drop-1745808799'),

An exhibition at Japan House London explores the craftsmanship behind the mouthwatering pieces.', 'A perfectly twirled bite of spaghetti hangs off a fork mid-air. Next to it, a bowl of ramen and a katsudon — freshly cooked eggs and pork cutlet – fall fresh out of the pan. Plates are stacked high with colorful sashimi and elaborate parfaits. It’s a feast for the eyes — and the eyes alone.\n\nThese are “shokuhin sampuru” — the highly realistic food replicas commonly displayed in front of restaurants in Japan, intended to lure customers inside. A familiar sight in Japan, a vast array of these replicas are now on display in London in an exhibition that is the first of its kind, according to Simon Wright, the show’s curator and director of programming at Japan House London.\n\n“Looks Delicious!” features replicas made by the Iwasaki Group, the first company dedicated to the production of these fake foods which remains today the largest producer in Japan. (The company needs to make on average one replica every 40 minutes in order to keep the business viable, according to Wright.) Its founder, Takizo Iwasaki, was reportedly inspired to create wax models of food from a childhood memory of seeing candlewax fall into a puddle and form into the shape of a flower.\n\nA version of Iwasaki’s first ever replica — modeled after an omelette his wife made — is on display at the exhibition, named “kinen omu,” or celebration omelette. Over time, Iwasaki developed a production method using wax and agar jelly molds, though now the company mainly uses PVC.\n\nHowever the origin story of food replicas more broadly is a “mess,” according to Nathan Hopson, a professor of Japanese at the University of Bergen who has studied the subject in-depth. Hopson told CNN in a video call that there are a myriad of theories as to how the replicas came to be introduced in Japanese culture.\n\nOne popular explanation, according to Japan House, is that they were made to familiarize Western dishes to a “curious yet cautious” Japanese public who otherwise wouldn’t know what to expect if they made an order. Among the swaths of traditional Japanese food, the exhibit also features strikingly realistic renderings of bacon, eggs and grilled cheese.\n\nThe exhibition’s centerpiece is a map of Japan made up of food replicas representing each of the country’s 47 prefectures. Each replica was specially commissioned and made by the Iwasaki Group, which created replicas of some dishes for the very first time.\n\nIt wasn’t easy to choose just one dish per prefecture for Wright’s team, who started by consulting a list created by Japan’s Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, before also reaching out to people from the regions. “You start to discover that a lot of people have a lot of opinions on this,” Wright said.\n\nAn exception was made for the northernmost prefecture of Hokkaido, the only one represented by two dishes: “kaisen-don,” a bowl of rice topped with seafood, and “ohaw,” a soup from the indigenous Ainu community. The Iwasaki Group had never made a replica of ohaw before, so the exhibition’s team had to ask the community to make them the dish, which was sent to Osaka overnight, photographed, and made into a replica the next day.\n\nCreating the impression of realistic liquids is one of the most difficult techniques to master in replica-making. Done right, the result is bowls of soup and glasses of wine which give the sense that they would spill over the table if mishandled by a curious visitor.\n\nThere is a ‘hyper-realism’ to these foods, explained Wright, which is intended to trigger the prospective customer’s memory, imagination — and hopefully catch their eye. “They are there to attract people in an instant,” he said. “To try and lure them to have lunch or to have dinner there.”\n\nAnd importantly, people trust that the food they see on display will live up to the food they get in real life, with Hopson calling them a “promise.” “I can go into any place in Japan, in any town and city and know exactly what I’m going to get,” he said.\n\nBut the replicas are more than marketing made pleasing to the eye. They serve a practical function, dating back to when they were introduced by Shirokiya, a major department store, in the aftermath of a devastating earthquake on Japan’s main island in 1923.\n\nThe store was one of the first places to open in Tokyo after the earthquake and serviced the masses of people who could no longer cook for themselves at home, explained Hopson, who studied the company’s history. Rather than decide their order when they reached the store’s top-floor cafeteria, a new system was designed: window displays could give customers the opportunity to look at the food on offer while they waited in line.\n\n“It’s really about this management side, supply-side rationalization that’s very much part of creating a new, modern, capitalist success story,” said Hopson, who added that they really took off in the 1970s, or Japan’s ‘year-zero’ for fast food.\n\nThough they continue to be a common sight in Japan’s restaurant windows, the replicas are also evolving in their function. The exhibition shows how food replicas can be used for quality control in agriculture, food manufacturing and for nutritional purposes by displaying the ideal diet for a person with diabetes.\n\nThe exhibition also gives visitors a chance to arrange their own bento box with the replica treats. Who said you shouldn’t play with your food?\n\n“Looks Delicious!” runs until February 15.

He details his subsequent nine-step skincare routine at length with added pointers. (Alcohol-based products are drying and “make you look older,” he offers). When his glistening herb-mint facial mask peels off, his real mask slips, revealing his unsettling stare.\n\n“There is an idea of a Patrick Bateman, some kind of abstraction, but there is no real me, only an entity, something illusory,” he monologues. “And though I can hide my cold gaze and you can shake my hand and feel flesh gripping yours and maybe you can even sense our lifestyles are probably comparable, I simply am not there.”\n\nThroughout the film — and even more so in the book, published in 1991 by Bret Easton Ellis — Bateman is obsessive over brands and consumer goods, rattling off his knowledge and judging others on their tastes. Today, his specter lurks online through the hyper-consumerist attitudes on social media that almost makes his character’s obsessive behaviors seem normal.\n\nInfluencers chronicle their minute-by-minute early morning fitness and wellness routines or multistep nighttime skincare regimen that appear to involve a never-ending array of products. The “morning shed,” popularized on TikTok, can involve peeling off or discarding multiple hydrating skincare masks, wrinkle patches, chin straps, mouth tape, LED masks, hair rollers and body wraps, all apparently worn overnight, to start the day. (Last year, Allure called the trend “the prison of being perpetually hot.”)\n\n“It’s a very relevant film for now, and of course, it was (released) way before social media,” said Jaap Kooijman, an associate professor in Media Studies and American Studies at the University of Amsterdam, who has written and taught on the book and film versions of “American Psycho,” in a phone interview. “But it’s based on the same principle of the outside appearance (and) consumer goods masking being empty inside.”\n\nThe film may depict a serial killer, but it’s the display of the “serial consumerism” of the era — then limited to traditional media like print and TV ads — that has become a fascinating harbinger as consumers’ aspiration for products that align with self-worth has only seemed to grow.\n\nThe film’s themes converge most directly in the “manosphere,” the increasingly persuasive corner of the internet pushing narrow and problematic views of masculinity. Bateman has often been held up as a cult symbol of the “sigma male,” an archetype for someone introverted and attractive who works hard, works out, has a good skincare routine, and also harbors contempt for women.\n\nEllis’ original intentions with his novel have been continually debated, with many critics believing the book to be inherently misogynistic. But director Mary Harron’s take on Bateman, co-written with screenwriter Guinevere Turner, has been considered feminist by some, including Kooijman, in its critiques.\n\n“We’re still watching a serial killer, but it’s so over the top, and so well played by Christian Bale that it’s, you cannot take it fully seriously,” Kooijman explained.\n\nThe same can be said of engagement-baiting online, where every trend is taken to extremes and context can be lost. Is it satire when a six-hour morning routine goes viral for dunking one’s face in iced sparkling water at 5 a.m. after pushups on the balcony? Or does it only become that when someone else responds with their version dipping their face into the bowl with each push-up? Bateman may have taken notes and ditched his gel mask.\n\nIn any case, it’s all performance, something that “American Psycho” toes the line with as Bateman is increasingly revealed as an unreliable narrator. Bateman obsesses over the symbols of status — his business card typeface, the ever-elusive reservation at the notoriously exclusive restaurant Dorsia — but the reality of his day-to-day activities is unclear. His peers misidentify him, his outbursts to fiancé (played by Reese Witherspoon) and secretary (Chloë Sevigny) aren’t met with responses, and his chainsaw-wielding murders are cleaned up like they never happened at all.\n\n“His persona as a serial killer is just as real — or not real — as his persona as a consumer and his persona as a (banker),” Kooijman said. “They become interchangeable, and that’s the terror, or the dystopian factor of ‘American Psycho.’”\n\nYet, while Ellis’ novel can be interpreted as a critique of the wealth and consumerism of New York in the ‘80s, a period of significant economic growth, it’s also presenting it, Kooijman said. “You could also read it as a celebration.”\n\nBecause of that, Bateman’s purpose may have been lost on the fans who could benefit from the film’s point. After all, by the end he is a pathetic figure, confessing his most depraved actions only to be called the wrong name and ignored once again (not so much a hero of masculinity after all).\n\nInstead, many young men are circling around the same preoccupations that Bateman did, “looksmaxxing” to improve one’s jawline or skin but to an echo chamber of like-minded disaffected internet users, much like investment bankers showing off new business cards to one another to inflate their self-worth. The manosphere, after all, is intended for itself.\n\n“You can always be thinner, look better,” Bateman tells his secretary when he invites her over for the evening.\n\nOnline, that message continues to resonate, as social media drives the insatiable hunger for more. In “American Psycho,” Bateman’s identity is a hollow assemblage of labels, products and condescending monologues — a blueprint for the experience of being online today.

The process will take years.', 'When Zach Gilyard, an art director in Brooklyn, got his first tattoo as a senior in high school, he did what most teenagers do and didn’t tell his parents. But not for the reasons you might think — Gilyard’s father and older siblings are all heavily tattooed, and Gilyard, like his mother, thought he would never join them. But on a whim 2006, he got a winged foot on his ankle to represent running, and kept it hidden around his family.\n\n“It was not very me,” he said in a phone call, of getting inked. “I kind of liked that it was a bit of a thrill for me, because it was a time where I couldn’t control the situation. I was doing something permanent.”\n\nTwelve years and several tattoos later, Gilyard abruptly decided to reverse course shortly after beginning a black-ink traditional patchwork sleeve on his left arm, starting with a panther head on his shoulder. It was big and bold, as intended, but left Gilyard feeling unsettled.\n\n“I always had a bit of buyer’s remorse every time I got one. It would last a week or two, and then I’d be happy that I did it,” he said. But this time, the feeling didn’t subside. “I had it for maybe a month, and I freaked out about it — it sent me into a whole panic. I couldn’t explain why. I just didn’t want it, so I told myself in that moment that I was going to get rid of it.”\n\nRoughly a quarter of people regret at least one of their tattoos, according to a 2023 Pew Research study surveying nearly 8,500 people in the US, as well as a smaller, separate study conducted in Turkey published the previous year. But it’s only fairly recently that tattoo removal has become more reliable and widely available. (This writer can attest to that; in 2008, she had a self-administered teenage stick-and-poke lasered off. It was an ordeal.)\n\nCelebrities have often drawn attention for their disappearing ink: Angelina Jolie famously removed Billy Bob Thorton’s name after their divorce in 2003; Megan Fox lasered off her portrait of Marilyn Monroe; and Pharrell told British Vogue in 2008 he was trying an experimental alternative that involved growing new skin. Most recently, Pete Davidson appeared newly bare-chested in a Valentine’s Day campaign for Reformation while undergoing removals of some 200 tattoos, though paparazzi shots following the ad revealed he is still sporting lots of faded ink.\n\nIn Gilyard’s case, he wasn’t lasering hundreds of tattoos, but it has taken more than half a decade and several thousand dollars to remove a handful of them, including the stubborn, highly saturated panther head. Now, that’s nearly gone, showing only a ghostly impression against the freckles on his skin. Other, smaller designs are even further along and barely noticeable to him, he said.\n\n“Results do vary, person to person, tattoo to tattoo,” said laser technician and tattoo artist Tim Goergen, who has been treating Gilyard at his shop, Gotham Tattoo Removal, in Brooklyn.\n\nTattoo ink sits in the dermis layer, or second layer, of the skin permanently because ink molecules are “too big for the body to break down,” Goergen explained in a phone interview. Laser machines release fast pulses of energy that heat and break the ink down into tinier particles, triggering an immune response that processes them through the lymphatic system. (A recent study in Sweden has linked tattoos — and their removal — with an increased risk for lymphoma, though its authors said more research is needed.) Tattoos that are easier to remove are usually older, made of black ink, have finer lines, and sit closer to the heart where there’s better blood flow, he said.\n\nGoergen charges between $100 and $450 for an individual session, while Removery, a national chain, cites $100-615 on its website. It’s difficult to predict how many sessions a client’s desired results will take, whether that’s fading a tattoo for a cover-up or complete removal, Goergen noted, “because everybody’s different.”\n\nWhy people remove their tattoos is often as idiosyncratic as why they get them. Sasha Goldbas-Nazarian, who lives in Los Angeles, decided to start laser treatments when she met her now-husband, who shares her Jewish faith but comes from a more conservative, Iranian family.\n\nInterpretations of the Torah, as well as associations with the Holocaust, have led tattoos to long be considered forbidden or taboo within Judaism, though contemporary attitudes towards it have somewhat shifted. “When we first met, he didn’t believe that I was Jewish because I had tattoos,” Goldbas-Nazarian recalled with a laugh. “He was like, ‘I’ve never really met any Jews that have tattoos.’”\n\nHe eventually offered to pay to remove her most visible tattoos, which she said were “younger decisions” made when she was in high school and college, including a star on her ankle done — unprofessionally — by her friend with a tattoo machine; a horseshoe and star on her upper back; and the initials “UWS” for New York’s Upper West Side, where she grew up, on her wrist. (Disclosure: This writer is a childhood friend of Goldbas-Nazarian, and a former colleague of Gilyard).\n\nGoldbas-Nazarian accepted, partly because her tattoos were faded and blurred and often invited questions, and partly because covering them with makeup for formal events had become a hassle during their relationship. But she didn’t anticipate how long it would take — or that it would be much more painful than getting tattooed in the first place, despite the fact that the laser sessions only last a handful of minutes each.\n\n“Even though (the sessions are) fast, it’s still really painful. And you can smell your skin burning a little bit, which grossed me out,” she recalled. She’s gone for the treatments on and off for years but has had to pause for an extended period while pregnant, per the medical spa’s policies, and as a new mom. She has no desire to rush back, either. “Honestly, even though I still have a lot of sessions to do, I’ve been putting it off just because of how painful it is,” she said.\n\nThough tattooing might typically bring to mind large, custom artworks or small flash pieces, cosmetic tattoos have become popular for their ability to enhance facial features and makeup — a so-called “semi-permanent” option for people wanting to remove the daily hassle of filling in their eyebrows or adding beauty marks.\n\nBut, cosmetic tattooing, which uses an alternative ink meant to produce a more natural finish on the skin, comes with its own set of challenges — as Z, who lives in the UK and prefers to go by her first initial to remain anonymous, discovered around three years ago. Her tattoos were tiny, resembling freckles across her forehead, nose and cheeks to replace natural ones she’d lost due to a rare side effect from a severe illness. She knew she would lose her hair during treatment, she said, but wasn’t aware that her complexion would drastically change.\n\n“Growing up, I had a face full of freckles — my nickname was actually ‘Freckles,’” Z said in a phone interview. “Then I got quite poorly, and basically my freckles and all my moles faded away. And so when I was well again, I felt really weird about my face, because it felt so bare.”\n\nAfter she came across a YouTube video of cosmetic freckle tattooing, she thought she would be able to get her freckles back. “But it went very wrong for me,” she said, explaining that the results didn’t feel natural. “You could tell that they were drawn on.” Unpleased with the outcome, she would cover them with makeup, but they still showed through.\n\nCosmetic tattoo ink is meant to eventually fade, but it doesn’t always. It also runs the risk of turning into other colors such as pink or orange over time, or when treated with laser. Z said she did her research and requested regular tattoo ink, but she does not believe her practitioner honored that request. Having more melanated skin put Z at a higher risk of hypopigmentation, a loss of skin pigment, during her tattoo removal.\n\n“There is no guarantee of perfect removal for any skin type, but it does become a little bit tougher on darker skin types,” explained Jordan Butler, founder of JHB Tattoo Removal, who has been treating Z, and sees clients with a range of complexions. “A lot of people that have come in and seen me in the past… have been told that they can’t have (a) tattoo removal, that it’s not possible. It’s definitely possible in most cases.”\n\nThough better laser technology in recent years has improved results and lessened unwanted outcomes such as hypopigmentation, Butler and Goergen emphasized that the outcome does depend on a technician’s knowledge and care. Ink pigment colors are targeted using different wavelengths, and some (like the one that targets warmer shades) are more “aggressive” than others, Goergen explained. “It’s possible to strip natural melanin out of the skin with the red or orange or yellow (inks),” he said.\n\nThat’s why patch-testing is crucial, Butler said, which he did extensively with Z. Her first session was painful, she said, but the discomfort has lessened over time — “now it’s barely anything,” she commented — and her healing has been straightforward.\n\n“I think we’re almost there,” Z said of her progress. “It’s so much better than what it was.”\n\nJayne Foo, a financial consultant based in Singapore, has experienced the more extreme side of recovery over the past few months as she’s embarked on the removal of around 70% of her tattoos, including one of her two full sleeves, a chest piece and a large stomach piece. And, for her 14,600 followers on Instagram, she’s documenting the entire laborious experience — open wounds, fluids and all. Redness, soreness and swelling are all common; but blistering can occur too, which Foo has experienced after both of her first two sessions.\n\n“I always knew I wanted to get tattoos, but as a young girl, I never had the money to get nice tattoos, so I just plastered anything I wanted on my body without thinking of how it would look in the future,” she told CNN in a phone call. On why she’s getting the tattoos removed now, she said: “I want a fresh start. I want to reclaim my skin.”\n\nThat’s the message Foo also hopes to share with her social media followers as she embarks on the yearslong process. She’s not the first influencer to document it — and some have begun partnering with clinics to promote and show results. But videos on social media are often limited to the session itself, which can be deceptive due to “frosting,” which appears to immediately lighten the ink but is actually a temporary effect that occurs briefly (for about 15-20 minutes) when the laser hits the ink,before returning to normal.\n\nFoo’s videos show the hours and days following her treatments, during which she experienced large, intense blistering and extreme itching from the scabbing that followed, the latter for which she was eventually prescribed antihistamines.\n\n“The first time I had it done, my arm swelled up twice the size,” she recalled. “I wasn’t expecting that at all.”\n\nFor the first few days of healing, she chose to remain indoors completely to minimize contact. “It’s just too much of a hassle to leave the house,” she said. “You have to be very mindful of your surroundings and you have to keep yourself clean.”\n\nFoo said she will continue to chronicle her treatments, as “it’s important to be real about it.” Accustomed to documenting many parts of her life online, including her fitness and travel, she also thought it would be “weird” to “suddenly not have tattoos” in her posts.\n\nConversely, Gilyard has taken a more discreet route and has kept his removal process mostly private — including from his parents once again. Though, they eventually noticed his faded tattoos.\n\n“My dad finally looked at my tattoos one day and asked why they look like an old man’s,” Gilyard said. “My mother just asked me how much it cost, and asked me how much the tattoos themselves cost, and just said it was all a waste of money,” he laughed. “But I think she’s happy that some are going away.”', 'Amending ‘younger decisions’', 'Published 5:59 AM EDT, Tue April 8, 2025', 'i-want-to-reclaim-my-skin-why-these-people-are-removing-their-tattoos-1745808799'),

It starts with an unedited photo of the user—usually slim—before the “chubby filter” trickles down the screen, altering the subject’s physique, while the song “Anxiety” by American rapper and singer-songwriter Doechii plays.\n\nAs more and more of these videos appeared, a backlash built from users concerned about an implicit body-shaming message. People began commenting on them—“this trend is mean girl coded,” wrote one user, whose comment received more than 5,000 likes.\n\nTikToker sadiebass16 said in a video: “Imagine you’re just trying to exist on this app and you see thousands of people using an AI filter to have a body that looks like your body, shaming it and all the comments being like ‘ugh, imagine.’ A lot of people can imagine.”\n\nLuna, a health and wellbeing app for teens, also criticized the filter for promoting “body shaming and unhealthy beauty standards.”\n\nCNN has reached out to TikTok for comment. The company told the BBC it had removed the filter from its app and that it was reviewing videos that featured the filter, making them ineligible for recommendation and blocking them from teen accounts.\n\nTikTok added that the filter was uploaded by a company called CapCut, which is a separate entity but has the same parent company, ByteDance.\n\nA search Monday morning for “chubby filter” brought up no results on the phone app. However, a search on the desktop version still threw up some content.\n\nThere are hundreds of filters on TikTok, and many are harmless—for example, adding bunny ears or a dog nose to a face.\n\nHowever, the app’s beauty filters have been widely criticized as damaging to users’ self-esteem. One such filter smoothes out wrinkles, supposedly returning users to their teenage selves but potentially playing into ageist beauty tropes.

Young people are using it to finesse facial features', 'https://edition.cnn.com/2025/03/22/style/facelift-surgery-young-patients/index.html', 'Leah Dolan', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/facelift-cake-2.jpg?q=w_2000,c_fill', 'A number of younger patients are seeking out facelifts in the hopes of achieving \"sharper features.\"', 'Kim Haberly’s dark blonde hair hangs behind her shoulders away from her face. Her almond-shaped eyes are faintly ringed by the yellow tone of an almost-healed bruise. There are two thumb-sized divots next to her hairline (barely perceptible until she points it out) from her recent temple lift, a cosmetic surgery that lifts the outer brow. Ironically, her swollen face looks plump and round despite her partial buccal fat removal — a procedure that extracts the soft pads of tissue found inside the cheeks to create a slimmer face. Still, she could pop to the store without raising so much as an eyebrow from on-lookers.\n\nIt’s not until Haberly turns her face to the right and raises the camera close to her ear, displaying two freshly sutured incisions, that you might suspect she is fresh out of a facelift.\n\n“I’ve woken up really swollen today because I slept on my side,” Haberly told CNN over a video call from her hotel in Turkey. Last month, Haberly traveled over 7,700 miles from her home in Perth, Australia to receive one of the most invasive facial surgeries available: a deep plane facelift. The advanced lifting technique — which has become a favorite of specialist surgeons for its apparent longer lasting results — not only repositions the top layer of skin (known as an endoscopic facelift) but also the complex network of tissue and fibrous muscles below.\n\nAt 37, Haberly, who also had a neck lift operation, is almost a decade more junior than the youngest average facelift candidate in Australia, and in the eyes of the American Society of Plastic Surgeons (ASPS), is at least a whopping 18 years ahead of schedule.\n\nTraditionally used to reduce signs of aging, the facelift is often associated with those in later life. In the US, almost 60% of facelift patients in 2023 were aged between 55 and 69, according to ASPS. Similarly Generation X, which encompasses those aged from 45 to 60, were the primary age group seeking out facelifts in Australia that same year, research from the Australasian College of Cosmetic Surgery and Medicine shows. And although there is no published data on the average age of a facelift patient in the UK, the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons (BAAPS) recently reported the procedure is “more common among those 50 and above.”\n\nYet, in the last few years, an increasing number of younger people have been seeking out the surgery — not as an anti-aging method but to finesse their features, having grown up in an extremely digital world where their physical appearances are constantly on show. According to the ASPS, the number of facelift patients in 2023 aged between 20-29 and 30-39 each jumped by 7% compared to the previous year, while those from the 40-54 age group grew by just 3%.\n\nDr. Jonathan Zelken, a board-certified plastic surgeon based in Newport Beach, California, who has performed a number of facelifts, has found that some of his clients in their 20s and 30s “want sharper jaw lines, sharper cheeks, sharper brows,” he told CNN over the phone. Rather than eliminate wrinkles, their goal is to enhance their existing appearance, Dr. Zelken explained. “It’s not a rejuvenation strategy. It’s a beautification strategy.”\n\nThe first known facelift was performed at Berlin’s Charite Hospital over 120 years ago. In 1901, an intrepid German doctor called Eugene von Holländer was approached by a Polish aristocrat looking for smoother skin. With her hands clasped to the sides of her face, the well-to-do woman is said to have demonstrated her request by lifting the corners of her mouth and cheeks. But Holländer was initially reluctant to operate, given that no such operation existed. Ultimately, as he recorded in his 1912 medical paper, he fell victim to “the art of feminine persuasion” and readied his scalpel. While there is little public information about patient zero, including her name, Holländer’s notes of her “aging wrinkles” and “drooping cheeks” suggest she was around the age of a prototypical candidate.\n\nOver a century later, the surgery is breaking new ground once again. This time, with those under 40. It’s a controversial procedure, but Dr. Zelken is largely in support of the newfound interest from this burgeoning demographic, whose operations have produced some of his “favorite” results.\n\n“It’s almost like you are doing a filter for social media in real life by doing these procedures,” said Dr. Zelken, who was hesitant to share the cost of his work, but pointed to Southern California’s ballpark range of $30,000 to $100,000 per facelift. While he acknowledged that a 20-something year old looking for a facelift would be a “yellow flag,” he wouldn’t be deterred solely on that. “It’s hard to put an age minimum on this procedure,” Dr. Zelken reasoned. Even where there are no drooping cheeks or aging wrinkles, “you can achieve really attractive change,” he said.\n\nThat’s also the opinion of some facelift patients. Emily Cipryk was 28 years old when she flew from Toronto, Canada to Istanbul, Turkey for a deep plane mid-facelift — a procedure that raises the tissue and skin around the corner of eyes as well as cheeks. “I really wanted to enhance myself, just to feel good about myself again,” she told CNN on a phone call. Cipryk’s previous job in financial technology during the pandemic meant she was on Zoom calls for hours a day, with her face constantly reflected back at her. “I partied a lot, from university until my late 20s, and it caught up with me… I just didn’t look good,” she said.\n\nCipryk received a total of six surgeries at once, including a blepharoplasty, lip lift, a rhinoplasty and partial buccal fat removal, which cost a total of €13,000 (about $14,140). The process was entirely financed by her fiancé, who also traveled with her to Turkey. “I did six procedures at once so I could just get it all done,” said Cipryk. She noted that she was “very happy” with the results.\n\nWhile Cipryk’s procedures went well, she cautioned others to “be careful” when selecting a surgeon in Turkey. “People get ahead of themselves and think, ‘Oh, it’s so cheap, I can afford it.’ And they might go to someone who’s not even a real plastic surgeon,” she said. “I’ve heard of people going to a real estate agent to get a hair transplant (because) they’re not doing their research.” In 2023, the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons published a joint statement with the Turkish Society of Plastic Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgeons warning of a rise in “serious complications and even deaths” linked to the “significant increase in numbers of patients travelling abroad for aesthetic plastic surgery.”\n\nUsing plastic surgery to maintain a youthful and symmetric appearance is not a new concept. Cosmetic procedures were first popularized in the early 20th century by Hollywood actors concerned with enhancing their on-screen appearance. But with the advent of social media and and the popularization of selfies, the pressures once reserved for those on the world stage now affect many individuals.\n\nCatherine*, a 33-year-old from Southern California, spends much of her time on Instagram and TikTok. “I’m watching videos of girls who are in their early 20s that are Instagram influencers and also celebrities who get the best work done,” she told CNN over a phone call. “So, you’re looking at all these people who are a lot younger and they’re perfect, and you’re really chasing that, even though that’s maybe not attainable for the average person.”\n\nFor Haberly, the desire for a facelift was partly born out of the rapid weight loss she achieved through semaglutide injections, which led her to drop about 15 pounds. Around three years ago, she started to notice loose skin around her jawline and began using sports tape — designed to support muscles and ligament injuries — to hide these areas.\n\nIt also didn’t help that as part of Haberly’s job as a hair colorist, she would often film her clients’ coloring sessions and post them on Instagram. Despite not being the focal point of the video, Haberly would often receive disparaging comments such as “You look haggard, you look old.” Haberly recounted: “That was probably more when the camera was lower. I would always know when I was going to get those (comments) because I could see myself when I posted that video.”\n\nUltimately, Haberly opted to undergo a facelift surgery, as she hoped it would “help the longevity of my career, which is really important.”\n\nSome surgeons are more wary of operating on younger patients.\n\nHaberly initially struggled to access the type of facelift she wanted in Australia — a country which requires a psychiatric test prior to a consultation with a cosmetic surgeon. She passed her mental health checks but was warned by local doctors on having a drastic procedure at her age. One surgeon offered an alternative, less invasive option that involved repositioning the skin rather than removing it entirely.\n\nHarberly was recommended by another doctor to wait until she was 50 for a facelift — but she didn’t want to reverse the clock, she wanted to pause it. “I want it now while I’m traveling the world and I’m out there and my face is everywhere,” she said. A similar sentiment was shared by Naomi*, a 45-year-old patient of Dr. Zelken’s who had a deep plane facelift last year. “I want to enjoy it now,” she told CNN. “I don’t want to wait until things get worse and worse… Let’s get ahead of it.”\n\nOn why a facelift appealed to her, Catherine explained: “I went through eight years of school plus grad school. I think the stress starts to show on you.” She added that she also felt insecure about some “asymmetry” caused by a medically necessary neck operation in her 20s, and after years of consistent Botox and laser therapy, she wanted “something that was 100% guaranteed to give me a result.”\n\nCatherine’s operation, which took place at her local clinic and included a lower face and deep plane neck lift, as well as the extra expense of overnight monitoring from a nurse, cost between $25,000 and $30,000.\n\nHowever, there’s reason to be cautious, according to Dr. Kelly Killeen, a board-certified plastic surgeon based in Beverly Hills. “The older population, they’re looking at the surgery because they want to restore something they had in their youth. Whereas younger people are sometimes chasing something that doesn’t exist,” she told CNN over a phone call.\n\nFace-tuning apps play a role in this, Killeen explained, pointing to facial laxity — a term used by surgeons to refer to looser skin — as an example that may seem unappealing but is expected with daily movement and neck function. “It doesn’t feel normal (to younger patients) because with the way people edit their photos and shoot their videos, you can’t sometimes see that celebrities have laxity in (physical) areas (that) bend,” explained Killeen, pointing to the neck and jaw as examples.\n\nWhether young facelift patients encounter greater risks than those in their 50s and 60s is disputed from surgeon to surgeon. In Dr. Zelken’s view, surgery complications such as nerve damage or muscle paralysis could be felt more deeply by a younger patient, as opposed to someone older.\n\nOne disadvantage of starting young is the higher likelihood of repeat operations, warned Californian surgeon Dr. Carl Truesdale. “Someone who is searching for a facelift when they’re younger are less tolerant of age in their face, so they’re going to be more sensitive to seeing age in their face when they’re older, right?” he said.\n\nThe more surgeries that are performed over a lifetime, the higher potential there is for traumatized tissue, Dr. Truesdale added, noting that revision operations are inherently more challenging. He estimated that last year he turned down facelift operations for around 50 people under the age of 40, with the reason that they “don’t need it.”\n\nDetermined to undergo the procedure, Haberly eventually scheduled a virtual consultation with a doctor in Turkey, communicating with a receptionist via Whatsapp and sending through photos of her face, pinching her skin and moving her head as directed. Her surgeon in Istanbul then sent through a procedure plan along with the price — $19,425 — and she flew overseas.\n\nWhen Haberly woke up the day after her surgery, the sensation in her body was unbearable. The swelling and bruising she went on to experience was underestimated by doctors, who weaned her off pain medication prematurely, leading to “excruciating pain” as a result, she said. “For two days straight, I was shaking (and) trembling,” Haberly recalled. Watching the clock on the hospital wall in a foreign country, minutes seemed to stretch into hours. “I remember saying to my mom, ‘What if I die from this pain? What if this pain never goes away?’” she said.\n\nBy day five, Haberly didn’t require any more pain relief. “I’d never recommend anyone do this. But you know, pain becomes distant,” she said. “I can see how happy I’m going to be with the results.”\n\n*Patients have requested for their names to be changed.', 'Mainstream appeal', 'Published 6:10 AM EDT, Sat March 22, 2025', 'facelifts-arent-just-to-combat-aging-young-people-are-using-it-to-finesse-facial-features-1745808799'),

While the platinum look, paired with ‘90s and Y2K-inspired ensembles, generated excitement among fans who hoped that it was Brown’s way of hinting at her role in a Britney Spears biopic, other publications criticized the actor for having “aged far beyond her years.”\n\nBrown, whose career in the entertainment industry began at 10 years old, fired back at articles that questioned the changes in her appearance as she matured. Among those she called out had headlines such as “What has Millie Bobby Brown done to her face?” and “Millie Bobby Brown mistaken for someone’s mom as she guides younger sister Ava through LA”.\n\n“I grew up in front of the world, and for some reason, people can’t seem to grow with me,” said Brown on Instagram. “Instead, they act like I’m supposed to stay frozen in time, like I should look the way I did on ‘Stranger Things’ Season 1. And now because I don’t, I’m a target.”\n\nBrown, now 21, pointed out that the focus on her looks was not only cruel but reflected the unrealistic standards directed at young women. “The fact that adult writers are spending their time dissecting my face, my body, my choices, it’s disturbing,” she said. “The fact that some of these articles are written by women? Even worse.”\n\nShe isn’t the only star who has fought back at judgmental comments made about their appearance in recent years.

One might have expected words of empowerment and self-acceptance to follow, but instead, the Ayuverdic therapist and makeup artist started rubbing the inside of a banana peel across her face.\n\n“It’s a wrinkle reducer,” Tewani continued to explain, noting that the peels contain lutein, an antioxidant that “can brighten, hydrate and soothe your skin.” When selecting bananas, “the riper, the better,” she advised. To date, the video has amassed over 2.2 million views and more than 61,200 likes.\n\nTewani, who is based in New York, dislikes the taste of bananas, although her children enjoy and eat them frequently, she told CNN over a phone call. “I was reading about bananas and how they’re rich in potassium and the peel has many nutrients inside. I wondered if it could help to hydrate the skin,” she explained.\n\n“When I looked it up online, I saw that a few people were already doing it, so I started experimenting on my face every time my kids ate a banana,” said Tewani. After a month of trials, she noticed that her “smile lines were a little bit more plump and fuller, even though I hadn’t changed too much in my skincare routine. That was really amazing to see.”\n\nTewani is not alone in finding alternative methods to improve the appearance of her skin. Many other beauty enthusiasts have also recently turned to ingredients you’d usually find in the food aisle, such as yogurt, flaxseed and even beef tallow, as a way to hydrate the skin and reduce acne. Rather than ingest the items, they’re rubbing them directly onto their faces — marking a trend that has since been coined on social media as “nature’s Botox.”\n\nIt’s a surprising development following the pandemic-induced skincare boom, where people spent heavily on science-backed moisturizers, toners and serums from high-end brands including Augustinus Bader, Dr. Barbara Sturm and La Mer, and the rise of tween girls (typically between 8 and 12 years old) flooding specialist beauty stores such as Sephora, as they shop for buzzy skincare labels like Drunk Elephant, Sol de Janeiro and Glow Recipe.\n\nIt’s also a trend that’s expected to continue picking up steam: a spokesperson from TikTok told CNN that, as of February, there are over 5,000 videos on the platform with the accompanying hashtag #NaturesBotox, a majority of which were shared over the past two months. So prevalent is the trend that common pantry foods, such as rice, have become a star ingredient in beauty brands’ products.\n\nClare Hennigan, principal analyst for beauty and personal care at global research firm Mintel, believes the shift is indicative of a growing interest in do-it-yourself (DIY) treatments over professional beauty services. Part of that is driven by cost — 77% of US individuals aged 12 to 17 said they enjoyed experimenting with new beauty or skincare trends, but 33% noted that their parents or guardians stopped them from buying something they wanted because it was too expensive, according to 2024 data from Mintel.\n\n“A large part of what fuels this is social media,” Hennigan explained to CNN over a call. “With DIY alternatives, there’s this fun that can be had with a community-driven discovery.”\n\nFor others, it’s less to do with financing and is simply “a lower perceived health and safety risk,” said Hennigan, pointing to facial taping — a non-invasive technique that involves applying a special adhesive tape to the face to tighten skin — as another DIY beauty hack gaining traction. Such treatments are no longer limited to the privacy of at-home routines, either. Doechii wore visible face tape for her performance at the 2025 Grammys, where she was awarded for Best Rap Album.\n\nFor Tewani, growing up with a holistic approach to beauty, as part of her Indian heritage, meant that using foods beyond simply sustenance was already part of the norm. “A lot of Indians growing up would eat a papaya or cucumber and rub the last piece on their face. Avocados and yogurt are popular as face masks. I’m not scared to use these raw ingredients on my face because I grew up doing that,” she said.\n\nDaniela Martinez, a copywriter based in West Palm Beach, Florida, was also influenced by her upbringing. “I grew up with my mom, who is a beauty guru and loves natural remedies,” she said. It led Martinez to look for “simple and natural ways” to improve her skin’s hydration and texture — a journey that she now shares on TikTok with her 13,300 followers.\n\nMartinez began incorporating flaxseed into her skincare routine after seeing videos from other young women praising the benefits of the seeds. Once or twice a week, she measures two cups of flaxseeds and boils them in water for about five minutes. Some people prefer to set the boiled seeds aside to cool down, Martinez noted, but she prefers to strain them immediately, using a cheesecloth. She’d then apply the seeds to her face and leave it on for about half an hour before rinsing it off.\n\nThe results, Martinez found, were impressive. “The tightening effect of the mask is absolutely insane,” she said. “My skin was more radiant and felt softer and smoother.”\n\nSome skin experts are unconvinced, however, warning that the efficacy and long-term benefits of many natural-based DIY skincare routines are unsubstantiated.\n\n“Flaxseed is a great digestive, high-fiber product that people can consume. People take that and think ‘well, if this is good to eat, then it can be good for the face.’ But there is low scientific evidence that flaxseed, beef fat or any of (these foods) are great moisturizers,” Muneeb Shah, a US-based dermatologist, who is certified in dermatology and micrographic surgery by the American Board of Dermatology, told CNN.\n\nMuch to Shah’s chagrin, Botox has become overused as a descriptor in beauty, because of the recognition it commands. “Every few months I see a new trend online where people are claiming that something is like Botox, but it’s often unproven. Botox is a well understood product and I think people like to use it like an anchor,” he said. With the exception of retinol or argireline, chemical compounds that now commonly appear in skincare, “there really is no topical product that’s going to get a result anywhere close to what Botox can do,” he said.\n\nDija Ayodele, a UK-based aesthetician and the founder of West Room Aesthetics, a skincare destination for women of color, believes there are hidden dangers to DIY natural remedies. Fruits contain varying levels of acids which could cause issues, such as chemical burns, depending on the sensitivity of a person’s skin, she warned. “If you’re using lemon to lighten the dark marks on your skin and you don’t use sunscreen, you’re opening yourself up to photosensitivity. With all things on social media, a lot of people will be fine, but there’s usually someone who’s more vulnerable and it will cause them a lot of problems.”\n\nLos Angeles-based content creator Grace May has also come to a similar conclusion. Driven by a desire for clearer skin, she recently experimented with beef tallow facials, though it didn’t yield the results she had hoped for. On the evenings May applied the beef fat to her face, she would eschew her usual moisturizer. “The first time I tried it, I found it really greasy,” she said. “If I didn’t let it sit on my face (for long enough before going to bed), I would also get greasy hair, because my hair sometimes goes into my face.”\n\n“I’m not the biggest DIY skincare person but I recently got acne, so if there is a product that is getting popular, I wanted to give it a try,” explained May. Though, ultimately, she has stopped using beef tallow altogether. “It seemed that my pores were just clogged by it, and I got even more pimples, so I did not want to continue after that,” she said.\n\nShah, who has undertaken several studies examining various natural oils, including sunflower, olive and coconut, and their effectiveness in repairing or moisturizing the skin barrier, has an explanation: oils with higher oleic levels, such as those from beef tallow, tend to have a higher possibility of causing skin irritation, he warned.\n\nBut, as with all routines, what works for one person might not necessarily for another, caveats May, noting that she wasn’t too disappointed by her beef tallow facials. “I was already prepared it might not work because I have hormonal acne, which is different from regular acne.” Still on a mission to reduce her acne, May’s new priority is gut health. “I’m eating cleaner now and using gentler products for my face,” she said.', 'DIY beauty hacks find an audience', 'Published 12:26 AM EST, Thu February 27, 2025', 'the-internet-is-raving-about-natures-botox-does-it-work-1745808799');

And no one is more aware of that than Ilona Maher.\n\nSince the Paris Olympics began last July, Maher has become an absolute sensation. She won a historic bronze medal as a member of the US Women’s Rugby Sevens squad, graced the cover of Sports Illustrated’s “Swimsuit Edition,” finished runner-up on “Dancing With the Stars,” garnered new endorsements on her social media accounts, and signed a contract to play with England’s Bristol Bears rugby team — which moved its matches to a bigger stadium to satisfy the surge in ticket demand upon her arrival.\n\nAll the while, she became the most followed rugby player on the planet with 8 million fans (and counting) across social media platforms.\n\nBecause for 28-year-old Maher, it isn’t just about the accolades — it’s about her message. With her signature sense of humor (and ever-present bold lipstick), she has spoken openly about body image, confidence and beauty “standards,” breaking the traditional mold and inspiring millions of followers in the process.\n\nSo, how does it feel to have become America’s sweetheart?\n\n“I love when people call me that because I feel like I’m maybe not the image you would have of a sweetheart in some sense of the word,” Maher told CNN’s Christina Macfarlane during a recent interview in Maher’s hometown of Burlington, Vermont.\n\n“I’m honored.”\n\nAt the same time, she adds, “This was kind of the trajectory I wanted it to take. I knew that in my sport, I wouldn’t just get to play my sport and be happy with it. I knew that I had to do more to have a comfortable life for myself, to spread my game, to spread rugby in general. So for years now, I’ve been leading up to this point, hoping to do what I’ve done.\n\n“And I’m so happy that this worked out like it did.”\n\nFirst and foremost, Maher is an athlete — one who is proud of her body, and what it can achieve, she says. But people often forget that athletes are more than what they see on the field.\n\n“I think (people) put female athletes, especially, into a box, like that’s all she is — ‘She plays on the field and that’s it.’ They forget the personalities that we have, how funny we are, the friendships, the way we are outside, the way we like to get dressed up,” Maher said.\n\n“So it was important for me to show many sides of me and the body positivity, body appreciation side kind of came naturally in a way because it is something that I feel strongly about. Also, with a lot of my content, I try to see what’s relatable for others. And it’s so interesting in my time of learning to appreciate my body, you kind of start to realize, ‘Oh, everybody has insecurities.’”\n\nMaher credits her parents — including her father Michael, who has played rugby for more than 40 years — for getting her into sports and supporting a positive body image, even as she “struggled with that growing up.”\n\n“I have a body that a lot of people would say is not feminine or is not beautiful or is too strong, too this and that,” she said. “I never understood why my big body looked like this, yet I was always so fit and I was always so fast and I could always keep up. I didn’t look like them, so I just love that people are seeing me.”\n\nBut learning she should never apologize for who she is was a crucial lesson — and it came from her father. While playing fast-pitch softball as a young girl, Maher recalled, another father on the opposing team came up to her and said she needed to slow down — not one of the other players could hit her pitches.\n\nMaher’s own dad was having none of it. He pulled out the rule book and said, “This is a fast-pitch league. She gets to throw fast pitches,” Maher remembered.\n\n“I think that was the first moment of being told to never tone it down,” she said, “because that dad over there … wanted me to tone myself down so that it could be easier for (his daughter). But that’s not the world, is it? The world isn’t going to tone down for you.”\n\nSpend any time scrolling through comments under Maher’s social media posts, and it won’t take long to see her confidence is a trait so many of her fans admire.\n\nAnd what she doesn’t have, she says, is imposter syndrome.\n\n“I feel like I deserve what I’ve got,” Maher told CNN. “I think I’ve worked very hard, even in the rugby space … And then I do all the work off the field.”\n\n“I posted videos consistently from (the 2020 Tokyo Olympics) until now,” she added. “I put myself out there, I put my whole personality — my whole everything — out there. So maybe I have a little (imposter syndrome) sometimes … but it’s OK to be proud of what you’ve done, and it’s OK to believe that you’ve worked to earn this.”\n\nCoincidentally, not long after her interview with CNN, Maher posted a video on her social media accounts lamenting the concept of imposter syndrome and the fact that people often assume successful women have it.\n\nHer unapologetic self continues to resonate. After her on-field debut with the Bristol Bears on January 5 — which featured a regular season league record crowd — Maher spent over an hour talking to fans, signing autographs and taking selfies.\n\n“Hopefully, what my fans see is also a person who’s not perfect, who shows every side of themselves … it’s a constant battle of learning to love and appreciate your body. It’s never going to be, ‘I got it. I figured it out,’” she said.\n\nShe says she’s grateful for the people who’ve helped her see her own body in this light, highlighting the role of rugby — a sport that shows what the body is capable of.\n\n“That was what really helped me. And then my teammates — being around other women like that who are so confident kind of feeds into your confidence … It comes from inside,” she added.\n\n“But it also can come from those outside factors and surrounding yourself with really good people.”', '“Never tone it down”', 'Published 4:08 AM EST, Wed January 22, 2025', 'the-ilona-maher-effect-how-a-whirlwind-six-months-made-her-the-face-of-rugby-and-so-much-more-1745808799'),

That was just my acne from the prosthetics,” Qualley said. “And I was like, ‘Oh this is actually kind of perfect. I’m playing all these different characters. For one of them, we’ll use all my crazy prosthetic acne.’ Yeah, it took me probably a year to recover physically from all of it.”\n\nBy making extensive use of prosthetics and other practical effects, “The Substance” depicts the story of celebrated actress and fitness guru Elisabeth Sparkle, played by Demi Moore, who is fired by her boss on her 50th birthday. She learns of a black market drug known as the Substance, which promises to deliver her a younger version of herself named Sue, played by Qualley, with certain caveats.\n\nThe movie falls into the body-horror genre so Sue gruesomely emerges out of a slit in Elisabeth’s spine and, as their relationship becomes more and more destructive, both their bodies decay in a parable about the pitfalls of chasing eternal youth.\n\nWithout giving too much away, it all culminates in a final act that brings new meaning to the term “bloodbath.”\n\nTowards the end of the movie, Qualley donned a prosthetic suit that she described as “a torture chamber” to the LA Times.\n\n“We would just go until I had a panic attack,” she said. “And the tempting thing is you want to peel it off, but of course you can’t do that, because you’ll bring your skin with you.”\n\nThe prosthetics could take “anywhere from six to nine and a half hours,” Moore told Access Hollywood at the Golden Globe Awards. She added that it took “at least an hour and a half to get it all off.”\n\nThe movie, which is the second feature from French writer-director Coralie Fargeat, has become a critical and commercial success, and entered the cultural zeitgeist. Moore and Qualley’s performances in particular are receiving much awards buzz, with Moore picking up a Golden Globe for best performance by a female actor in a musical or comedy motion picture.', '', 'Published 7:03 AM EST, Thu January 16, 2025', 'margaret-qualley-says-her-skin-took-a-year-to-recover-from-the-substance-prosthetics-1745808799'),

They were each other\'s first love, but lived on opposite sides of Atlantic. Almost three decades later, life brought them back together.', 'When American teenager Kerri Cunningham was dragged by her parents to Europe in the summer of 1993, she was less than impressed.\n\nDragged might sound like dramatic wording, but that’s how 14-year-old Kerri saw it at the time.\n\nKerri reacted to the vacation plans “from the teenage point of view of ‘Oh, it’s taking away from my summer break, and I want to hang out with my friends.’”\n\nLeaving her beachside hometown in the Hamptons, in New York, was the last thing she wanted.\n\n“I was dreading the trip,” Kerri tells CNN Travel today.\n\nLooking back today, Kerri says this was all a bit of a “spoiled brat, teenage attitude.” The trip — embarking first to the UK, then France and culminating in a two-week-bus tour around Italy — was an amazing opportunity.\n\nKerri realizes now that she was fortunate. Her parents wanted their daughters to see the world. But it was hard to see it that way back then. All teenage Kerri could fixate on was the time away from her life in New York.\n\nLittle did Kerri know this voyage to Europe would change her life forever. That she’d still feel the reverberations of this trip three decades on.\n\nThe first few days of the trip were uneventful, at least in Kerri’s mind. She sulked her way across the UK, and boarded a ferry with the other tour participants from Dover, England to Calais, France. She was glad two of her sisters were on the trip too, but she still resented being there.\n\n“And then I saw Dirk,” recalls Kerri. “And it instantly got better.”\n\nAs the ship crossed the English Channel, and the White Cliffs of Dover retreated into the distance, Kerri’s parents got chatting to an English family, the Stevenses, who were also en route to the continent to embark on the Italy bus tour.\n\nDirk was their 15-year-old son. Like Kerri, he was a reluctant teenage tagalong to a family holiday. But then he smiled at Kerri, and everything started to look up.\n\nKerri thought he was “so handsome.”\n\n“I was immediately smitten,” she admits. “Hugh Grant was really big at that time. And he sort of had this young Hugh Grant hair. Being an American girl, Hugh Grant was the guy.”\n\n“A bad haircut,” says Dirk today, laughing. “But it worked at the time.”\n\nDirk tells CNN Travel he also felt an “instant attraction” to Kerri. He vividly remembers his first impression of her: “Beautiful smile, dark hair, really pretty.”\n\nBefore long, the two teens were sitting side-by-side, sharing headphones and listening to Kerri’s Walkman music player.\n\nTheir parents bonded quickly, too.\n\n“We all just got chatting and hit it off,” recalls Dirk. “Our dads are sort of similar guys, you know, like to take machines apart, make something new, build something, design something, have a bonfire…”\n\nAs the group disembarked the ferry in France and boarded the bus to Italy — stopping off here and there en route — the two families grew even closer.\n\n“Our dads would be in a pub somewhere or grabbing a drink, and the moms would be shopping,” recalls Kerri.\n\nTheir parents’ friendship helped cement Kerri and Dirk’s bond, and Kerri also enjoyed observing the way Dirk interacted with his family. Dirk’s dad used a wheelchair, and Dirk was often the family member who’d help his dad navigate the cobbled streets of Italy.\n\n“Here’s this 15-year-old who’s pushing his dad all over Europe in this wheelchair, and not complaining about it, and getting on with it, but doing it with a smile on his face,” Kerri recalls.\n\nShe noticed that Dirk seemed to always “see the bright side of everything.” His warm, breezy attitude won her over.\n\n“I had never met anyone my age who was so comfortable with himself and his family and so accepting of me and mine,” says Kerri. “Everything was just easy and fun. We just got each other and there was a very strong attraction.”\n\nIn the evenings, while the parents were deep in conversation and Kerri’s sisters were doing their own thing, Dirk and Kerri would steal time alone.\n\n“Us two, sneaking off…” recalls Dirk. “There are pictures of us with bottles of champagne we’d taken at dinner.”\n\nThey became “fast friends, which became romantic,” as Dirk puts it. At one of the Italian hotels, they danced together, arm-in-arm. They always sat together at dinners, stealing glances and sharing in-jokes.\n\n“We just felt so comfortable together,” says Dirk. “I remember being on a gondola in Venice and just laughing the entire time.”\n\n“I’m pretty sure we stole a few kisses when our parents weren’t looking,” says Kerri. “I thought he was the cutest boy I had ever met.”\n\nAt the end of the two-week tour, the Cunninghams and the Stevenses promised to stay in touch. There was already talk about getting together the following summer.\n\nStill, for Dirk and Kerri, saying goodbye wasn’t easy. In fact, “it was awful,” says Dirk.\n\n“Just as you find someone special, you have to say goodbye,” he recalls. “But, our parents had already said we’d meet them next summer. Nothing was planned at that point, but everyone was excited for the idea.”\n\nBack in their respective hometowns on opposite sides of the Atlantic, the Cunningham family and the Stevens family remained connected.\n\n“Mum would talk to Mom and we’d be on the phone after,” recalls Dirk. “And Dad with Dad. Soon dates were arranged and the excitement and anticipation builds up.”\n\nA plan was in place: the Stevenses would visit New York in the following summer of 1994, and stay with the Cunninghams at their home on Long Island.\n\nAs they counted down to this reunion, Dirk and Kerri exchanged letters, sending each other magazine clippings and writing dispatches about their lives on opposite sides of the Atlantic.\n\nThey also enjoyed “long phone calls with the old plug-in phones, when you had a really long extension lead so you could go and sit on the stairs or in the bathroom to try and get privacy,” as Dirk recalls.\n\n“My dad was very strict, so I wasn’t allowed to talk to many boys on the phone,” says Kerri.\n\nBut Dirk was an exception.\n\n“Unlike other boys our age, he wasn’t afraid to talk to my parents on the phone,” she says. “In fact, I think he really enjoyed it! And my parents really loved him.”\n\nFor Kerri and Dirk, the 12-month countdown to their reunion only intensified their feelings for each other.\n\n“We’d missed each other for a year, were desperate to see each other,” says Dirk.\n\nKerri remembers the moment she saw Dirk again on Long Island in summer 1994. He smiled at her. Right away, she felt “at home.”\n\nShe loved how he greeted her, calling her “darling.”\n\n“I know it’s an English thing,” says Kerri of the pet name. “But when he called me ‘darling’ — in person, in emails or on the phone — my heart would just melt.”\n\n“It was a very exciting time,” says Dirk of that summer in New York.\n\nKerri and Dirk spent every moment together. They hung out at the beach together, Dirk tagged along to Kerri’s summer job. They spent long evenings in each other’s company.\n\n“This was first-love stuff,” says Dirk. “Knowing that our time together was limited, made it all the more special.”\n\n“We loved each other and were great friends, but we lived an ocean apart and never even considered being together. I guess we thought… ‘How could we?’ We were just teenagers,” says Kerri.\n\nWhen Kerri and Dirk said goodbye at the end of Dirk’s visit, they did so accepting “that we couldn’t be together,” she says.\n\n“But knowing that we’d get to see each other again at some point,” adds Dirk.\n\n“Yeah,” says Kerri. “I kind of felt like, ‘Oh, we’ll always… we’ll always…”\n\n“…Have this,” says Dirk, finishing Kerri’s sentence.\n\nAfter their New York summer, Kerri and Dirk continued to write letters and speak to each other on the phone. But as they finished up high school, this communication gradually slowed down.\n\nCalls became “every two months, then three months…” recalls Dirk.\n\nThen they dropped off almost completely when they graduated. It was still the mid-1990s, and there was no social media offering easy long distance back-and-forth. Staying in touch required time and effort.\n\n“We both got busy. We loved each other, but we weren’t sure when we’d get to see each other again,” says Dirk. “We were both students that couldn’t afford expensive flights. Life gets in the way.”\n\n“We were both going to college, working, dating and our lives were moving ahead,” says Kerri. “We were so far apart, being together just didn’t seem possible.”\n\nStill, even when they weren’t in touch, the two always thought of each other fondly. Plus, their parents remained connected, so Kerri and Dirk got regular secondhand updates on each other.\n\n“Mum would pass me on information about Kerri and the family,” recalls Dirk. “We’d catch each other every now and then.”\n\nAs email became more commonplace, Kerri and Dirk would send the occasional note back and forth. They’d write, as Dirk recalls it, “how you doing? Thought of you today. Miss you.”\n\n“Emails were easier than phone calls,” he says.\n\nThen, in Kerri’s first year of college, her father was diagnosed with ALS, a progressive neurodegenerative disease. When she was 19, he passed away.\n\nIt was a devastating loss for Kerri and the Cunningham family. The Stevenses were also heartbroken to hear the news.\n\nAround the time of her father’s death, Kerri had been supposed to go to Paris with some girlfriends. The trip got called off.\n\nThrough the grapevine, Dirk’s mother heard about Kerri’s canceled vacation. She immediately offered a suggestion to Kerri’s mother: she’d love to take Kerri and Dirk to Paris, together. Dirk’s mother had studied there when she was younger, and knew the city well. It was the least she could do, she said, after the loss they’d weathered.\n\nLooking back today, Kerri suggests that Dirk’s mother was also keen for Dirk to reconnect with Kerri.\n\n“She knew how much we cared for each other and I think she wanted us to be together as much as we wanted it,” says Kerri.\n\nKerri’s mother encouraged her daughter to go. Soon, Kerri started daydreaming about Paris again. Flights were booked and hotels arranged — and Kerri and Dirk got back in regular touch. Via email, they started counting down the days until their reunion.\n\n“All that excitement built up again,” says Dirk.\n\nKerri hoped seeing Dirk would be a balm to her grief. And when he picked her up from the airport in February 2001, she was proven right.\n\nIt was like they’d never been apart, though it had been seven years since they’d last seen each other in person. They were now in their early 20s.\n\n“We were different, we’d grown up a bit,” says Dirk. “Kerri was more beautiful.”\n\n“It happened to be Valentine’s Day week,” says Kerri. “It was very romantic.”\n\nWith Dirk’s mother leading the way, Kerri and Dirk visited Notre Dame, took walks on the Seine, climbed the Eiffel Tower, visited the Moulin Rouge and toured the Louvre. They also went off the tourist track.\n\n“Mum had studied Art History and languages there, so she took us to see unusual buildings, unique architecture, cafes she remembered…” says Dirk.\n\nEverywhere in Paris felt suffused with romance. The Eiffel Tower was emblazoned with a big red heart. All the restaurants had roses on the table centerpiece.\n\n“Everywhere we went Dirk would say ‘Do you like that? I ordered it special, just for you.’ And his mom and I would laugh,” says Kerri.\n\nBut it really did feel, recalls Kerri, like “everything in Paris that week was for us.”\n\n“It was magical,” she says. “After his mom would go to bed, we’d go out and find a little bar where we would have drinks and dance and share our fears and our dreams. It was so lovely and I didn’t want it to end.”\n\nThe trip was perfect, but it also felt bittersweet. Kerri was grieving her father. Some part of her also saw Paris as a farewell to her teenage love for Dirk.\n\nAs an adult, she felt the barriers of ever being together even more acutely.\n\n“It just seemed impossible,” she says.\n\nDirk and Kerri were now in their early twenties, tied to their respective home countries through jobs, friends and commitments.\n\nThey said farewell at the end of the week with no plans to see one another again.\n\n“We knew we’d keep in touch and fate would do its thing,” says Dirk. “It’s always a tough goodbye, with hugs, tears and kisses.”\n\n“I guess it always felt like a ‘vacation romance’ and we told ourselves that’s all it was to avoid getting hurt,” says Kerri.\n\nAfter Paris, Kerri went back to New York and Dirk returned to the UK. As they moved through their twenties, Kerri and Dirk both made life choices that cemented them on different paths.\n\n“I had different girlfriends, and ended up having a baby and later getting married and having three children,” says Dirk.\n\nMeanwhile, Kerri met and fell in love with a fellow Long Islander, Dean.\n\nThe Cunningham family and the Stevens family remained in touch. Kerri’s mother went to Dirk’s sister’s wedding in the UK. Dirk’s parents visited Kerri’s mother in New York. And Dirk’s parents attended Kerri’s wedding to Dean, in the summer of 2010.\n\n“All the families were still connected and loved each other,” says Dirk.\n\nThrough their families, Kerri and Dirk learned updates about one another, and how they were navigating life’s ups and downs.\n\nIn 2015, Dirk’s daughter was diagnosed with a rare genetic neurological and developmental disorder. Then in 2016, his mother died suddenly.\n\nAnd that same year, Kerri’s husband Dean was diagnosed with a terminal Glioblastoma brain tumor.\n\nDirk reached out to Kerri after hearing the news, offering his support from afar.\n\nBut Kerri was swept up in hospital appointments, caring for her husband and processing the inevitable loss that was to come.\n\n“It was 20 years after my dad…it just felt like ‘This is happening again,’” recalls Kerri. “I remember looking at my mom and my sister and just saying, ‘I can’t do this.’ But you do it, you find the strength and you do it.”\n\nEighteen months after his cancer diagnosis, Dean passed away.\n\n“I lost him in 2017,” says Kerri. “We did not have any children.”\n\nIn the aftermath of Dean’s passing, Kerri says her “world turned upside down.” She didn’t know how to process the loss or what to do next.\n\nA couple of years passed in a blur. Kerri fell into a relationship that didn’t feel right. She agonized over the future.\n\n“Then my aunt suggested a trip to Ireland with her to ‘get away,’” says Kerri. “Around the same time, Dirk emailed me to see how I was doing. I told him of my upcoming plans for Ireland and he asked if he and his dad could meet us there. We hadn’t seen each other in 17 years.”\n\nKerri was surprised when Dirk suggested joining her in Dublin. She said Dirk and his father were welcome to come along, but internally, she doubted they would. Kerri knew Dirk was married, with three children in the picture. She thought it was unlikely that he would board a flight to Dublin to see old family friends out of the blue.\n\nBut unbeknownst to Kerri, Dirk was separated from his wife. The couple had gone through a tough time and were in the process of getting divorced. Dirk had moved in with his father.\n\nDirk didn’t mention any of this to Kerri in his emails. He didn’t want to seem like he was trying to overshadow Kerri’s loss. And he didn’t have any specific intentions when he got back in touch. He’d just been trying to reconnect with old friends in the wake of his marriage breaking down. He knew his father would enjoy seeing Kerri, and it was easy for them to get to Ireland from their home in England.\n\nUntil the moment Kerri and Dirk reunited in Dublin, she didn’t believe he’d come.\n\nBut then, suddenly, he was in front of her. Standing there, in person, for the first time in almost two decades.\n\n“When we saw each other, we hugged so tightly and I started crying. I realized I had never stopped loving him and, boy, was it nice to be hugged by such an old, true friend,” recalls Kerri.\n\nShe surprised herself by feeling the same sentiment she’d felt when she reunited with Dirk on Long Island, in the summer of 1994: “It felt like I was home.”\n\nDirk felt this same feeling when he saw Kerri: a surprising certainty that everything was right with the world, despite everything they’d been through while they were apart.\n\nThe two spent the rest of the day in Dublin together, with Dirk’s father and Kerri’s aunt completing the party. They toured the Guinness Factory and went out for dinner as a group.\n\nAnd as Dirk pushed his father’s wheelchair through the Dublin streets, Kerri’s aunt walked alongside, Kerri had a feeling of déjà vu. It felt like the summer they’d first met, touring Europe in 1993, “like we were teenagers again. Just exploring a city with our chaperones.”\n\nThey were only together for a couple of days, but during this time, Kerri and Dirk opened up to each other. She told Dirk about her unhappiness and uncertainty amid her grief. He told her about his marriage breakdown.\n\n“As old friends do, we talked — about all the good and bad going on in our lives — and the truth came out,” says Kerri. “It felt like some divine intervention that we were there for each other.”\n\n“That holiday, the time we spent, was just perfect, and it was just what we both needed, unknowingly, perhaps,” says Dirk.\n\nIt helped that their long history led to an easy comfort, even after years apart. They felt able to be totally honest with each other.\n\n“It was very freeing to just be with someone that you trust and spill your guts to them,” says Kerri.\n\nPerhaps it was Kerri and Dirk’s ease with one another that explained why, everywhere they went, strangers assumed they were a couple.\n\n“In a pub, just having a conversation in a queue…they’re like, ‘Oh my God. How long have you two been together? You’re the nicest couple we’ve ever met,’” recalls Dirk. “And we’re like, ‘No, we’re not. We’re old friends, and we just came with my dad and her aunt.’”\n\nThe two laughed off strangers’ assumptions, but both wondered if there was something in them.\n\nAs they readied themselves to say goodbye, both Kerri and Dirk hoped this wouldn’t be goodbye forever.\n\nAnd then, before Kerri left for the airport, Dirk decided to take a chance: he told Kerri he loved her.\n\n“Maybe we can make this work?” he asked her.\n\nFor Kerri, this was the decisive moment. It was scary and unknown, but she felt she should take a leap of faith into a life with Dirk. She knew she loved him too.\n\n“I knew I had to give us a real chance, because something much bigger had brought us back together,” she says today.\n\nThe leap of faith paid off. Today, six years since they reunited in Ireland, Kerri and Dirk are a couple, now in their forties, living life together, as a team.\n\nKerri’s job still ties her to the US, while Dirk’s kids live with him fulltime, so he’s in the UK.\n\nBut the couple make the back and forth work. Kerri splits her time across the Atlantic, and loves spending time with Dirk’s children. She says getting to know them has been “a real gift.”\n\nIn the six years since they reunited, Kerri and Dirk have helped each other rebuild their lives, embrace the present and embark on a new future together.\n\n“Needless to say, both of our families were over the moon,” adds Kerri.\n\nDirk’s father recently passed away, but before he died, he told Kerri she was the best thing that happened to his son.\n\nKerri’s mother, who is in her eighties, is also very supportive. When Kerri told her she’d reunited with Dirk, Kerri’s mother told her their love story was “written in the stars.”\n\n“While she doesn’t love me being so far away most of the year, she knows that I am where I’m meant to be,” says Kerri.\n\nWhile Kerri and Dirk wish that her father and his mother had also lived to see them finally get together, Kerri believes they know. She feels their presence, their influence in her life, all the time.\n\n“We have lots of angels that look over us,” Kerri says, referring to all the loved ones she and Dirk have lost, including her late husband, Dean, who she’ll always hold close to her heart.\n\n“Dean and I, we traveled all around the world, and we did fun stuff, and he lived an amazing life as well. I’m forever grateful for those years,” Kerri says, reflecting that “Dean would be very happy” to see where she is today.\n\nNavigating the loss of her late husband also helped Kerri have the courage to embrace her new chapter with Dirk.\n\nWhile she always felt safe and comfortable with Dirk, she knew any relationship comes with risk, with its challenges and uncertainties.\n\n“But after Dean died, I said, ‘I’m not afraid of anything, because I feel like I’ve been through the worst thing possible,’” recalls Kerri. “If this doesn’t work, then it doesn’t work.”\n\nAnd when Dirk makes her laugh and makes her smile, Kerri embraces that happiness wholeheartedly and gratefully, not taking any of it for granted.\n\n“We always have fun,” Kerri says of her life with Dirk. “You can’t be sad forever. Life goes on, and I think everybody deserves to be happy…and the hard times are always the hardest when you’re in them and you realize how strong you know we all are. We’re all a lot stronger than we think we are.”\n\nTogether, Kerri and Dirk’s attitude to life is to “accept and enjoy the journey,” as Dirk puts it.\n\n“Enjoy the journey,” echoes Kerri. “That’s how we started. We started out on a journey. And we met each other.”\n\n“And now we’re just continuing the journey,” says Dirk. “Let the universe take you along. You know, it will guide you where you’re meant to go.”\n\nKerri adds — jokingly — that the moral of their story is “go on a trip with your parents when you’re a teenager, even if you don’t want to.”\n\nBut more seriously, Kerri suggests it’s “allow yourself to be happy, and to be open to the universe.”\n\n“We were always meant to be together,” she says of Dirk. “We are twin flames that found our way back to each other after all those years.”', 'A significant meeting', 'Published 9:08 AM EDT, Fri April 25, 2025', 'they-had-a-teen-summer-romance-26-years-later-they-reunited-1745808910'),

Nearly eight years later, she’s still there.\n\n“Honestly, it was the best decision I ever made,” says Melissa. “Looking back now, if I hadn’t done it then, I would have never done it.”\n\nReflecting on her big move, Melissa explains that she’d grown tired of the “work hard, play hard mentality” she was accustomed to in New York, and was ready for a change.\n\n“I think by the time I was 28, I started to realize, there has to be more to life than just this,” says Melissa, who was born in the Dominican Republic, but raised in the Big Apple “from infancy.”\n\n“I never really felt like I fit in in New York,” she adds. “I think I was just at a point where I needed something different.”\n\nMelissa soon realized that she’d been living her life based on the things that other people wanted for her and hadn’t really taken the time to decide what she wanted for herself.\n\n“I grew up in a very bad neighborhood, made it through school, got a scholarship for high school, got a scholarship to Syracuse University and graduated with two degrees,” she says.\n\n“Everything that your immigrant family tells you you need to do.”\n\nFeeling as though she needed to step out of her comfort zone, Melissa decided to put herself “in the most uncomfortable situation” she could imagine.\n\nFor her, this was moving to a country she had only visited once and didn’t speak the language.\n\n“I felt like I had been hindered by kind of closing my circle off,” she says. “New York is such a bubble sometimes. You don’t realize it until you’re out of it…”\n\nShe began the application process for a Munich-based job shortly after returning to the United States, and was thrilled to be offered the position.\n\nAccording to Melissa, her workplace helped her through the process of applying for a German working visa — which is granted to non-EU citizens with a job offer from a German company — hiring a lawyer for her, making the transition much easier.\n\n“I took a month off,” Melissa says. “And then it was literally packing up my life, which is like 28 years into three suitcases. I had to give up so many beautiful shoes.”\n\nAfter bidding farewell to her friends and family, Melissa flew to Munich, via Lisbon, Portugal, to begin her new life.\n\n“I landed on a Sunday,” she recalls, describing her disappointment when she found that pretty much everywhere was closed, so “there was nothing to eat” when she arrived at her apartment.\n\nThe following day, Melissa set about obtaining her tax ID information, which needs to be obtained in person in Germany, from the local tax office in order to begin her new role.\n\n“It took another two to three weeks before I was able to even step foot in the office” she says.\n\nDuring her first few months in Munich, Melissa did her best to immerse herself into Bavarian culture, and loved how exciting and new everything felt.\n\n“You’re like, ‘I’m here. I’m making it happen like ‘Emily in Paris.’ I’m gonna do it,’” she says.\n\n“Mind you, this was before ‘Emily in Paris.’ “I was ‘Melissa in Munich.’ So, unprecedented at the time.”\n\nHowever, even seemingly simple tasks like going to the supermarket proved to be incredibly taxing at times.\n\n“I spent two hours there because I had no idea what the hell I was buying,” she says.\n\nAlthough she loved being in Munich during the festive period, and visited many of the local Christmas markets, when the New Year rolled around, it was “super cloudy” and “raining all the time,” and Melissa began to question her decision to uproot her life.\n\n“You’re like, ‘Oh, wow. Did I really sign up for this?’” she recounts, noting that the first year spent living in a new destination is “always the hardest.”\n\n“You could decide after a year that maybe this isn’t for you,” she concedes, admitting that she considered giving up at times.\n\n“But I think I was so hell bent on making it work that I was like, ‘This is the uncomfortable. If you succeed in this, and then in the end, you’re like, ‘I still want to go back,’ New York will always be there.’\n\n“And I kept telling myself that.”\n\nMelissa admits that it took a while for her to adjust to the slower pace of life in Munich, but she ultimately found this to be a huge reset for her.\n\n“It’s taken me such a long time to honestly undo from all the years of living in New York,” she says.\n\nMelissa goes on to explain that Sundays in Germany are known as “Ruhetag,” or a quiet day, and “you’re not supposed to drill or play music.”\n\n“I play music, because I’m Latin,” she adds. “But other than that, I try not to do heavy lifting.”\n\nGermans are renowned for their directness, and Melissa stresses that this is one cultural difference that she’s had no trouble adapting to.\n\n“This is another part of why I felt misplaced in New York,” she admits. “I am super honest, probably sometimes to my own detriment. So coming here, it was a relief, because these people were just as honest as I am…\n\n“That’s why I feel like I connect more with the Germans… It was nice to be in a place where I didn’t have to hold my tongue all the time.”\n\nWhile Melissa acknowledges that Germany has a reputation of being an incredibly hard-working nation, she’s found that there’s “a big emphasis on balance.”\n\n“It’s crazy because when I was telling my friends I was going to Germany, their first impression was, ‘Oh my God. They don’t relax. They are always working,’” she admits.\n\n“I don’t think it’s necessarily completely true. They are hard workers… But I try to really embrace this idea of balance and giving myself space.”\n\nMelissa adds that she was thrilled to learn that Germany has so many public holidays — nine in total — each year.\n\n“So you get a lot of vacation,” she says, adding that she went from “10 vacation days a year to like 30.”\n\nMelissa loves the fact that people in Germany seem to be “really big on nature,” and she often spends the whole day outside during summertime.\n\n“Actually, I don’t even own a TV,” she says. “That’s the crazy part. I just decided, I really need to embrace this, and it’s got to become part of the lifestyle that I live, which I really, really appreciate.”\n\nWhen it comes to the cost of living, Melissa has found Germany to be much more affordable than the US, pointing out that she’s able to “fill her fridge” for around 100 euros ($114.)\n\n“Everything’s super accessible, super affordable, and the quality is just so much better,” she says.\n\n“Even when I go back to New York now I actually refrain from buying meat. I just think that the quality has gone down.”\n\nShe points out that she feels incredibly secure in the “super safe” country — Germany is often ranked among the safest countries in the world — explaining that she’s had to train herself to stop looking over her shoulder before she puts her key into her apartment door.\n\n”I think the worst thing that’s happened to me was that my bike was stolen one year,” she says,\n\nWhile she’d initially only planned to spend a few years in Germany, this quickly “turned into eight.”\n\n“And now I’m a permanent resident,” she adds. “So I don’t see myself leaving.”\n\nMelissa was already bilingual when she moved to the country, speaking both French and Italian, as well as English, and assumed that she’d pick up German easily.\n\nHowever, she “totally underestimated” how hard it would be.\n\n“German is really difficult,” she says, adding that she put a lot of time and effort into mastering the language and is now at a point where she can visit her doctor and speak in German, and text back and forth with her German friends.\n\n“I’m one of those people, when I learn a language, I need to know every single nuance,” she explains.\n\n“And the crazy thing about German is there’s always a reason and a rationale behind everything.”\n\nWhen questioned about the current political tensions in Germany, where far-right parties have been moving from the political edges to the mainstream in recent years, Melissa says that she’s aware of the headlines, but it isn’t something that has an impact on her day to day life.\n\n“I have not felt the type of political ideologies that make me feel unwelcome or unsafe,” she says, adding that she felt more exposed to political divisiveness while she was in the States.\n\nAfter nearly a decade in Germany, Melissa can’t ever see herself returning home and feels as though there’s little left for her back in New York.\n\n“Some of my friends are here in Europe,” she says. “And a lot of my other friends have moved to other cities.\n\n“Everybody has left New York. And for me, I grew up there. It was great back then. I don’t really know how I could live there now.”\n\nMelissa has visited various European destinations during her time in Germany, including Italy, France and Spain, and admits that she’s toyed with the idea of moving to the latter, which is where her maternal grandmother is originally from.\n\nHowever, she says she’s more than happy to stay put for now.\n\n“I’ve always been interested in finding out more about the Spanish side of my family,” she says. “I have not found anybody that is connected to my genetics, unfortunately, here in Europe, at least.\n\n“I think my end goal will be to live in Spain. For now, I’m really quite enjoying living in Germany.”\n\nMelissa says she’d urge anyone considering a move to a new country to be as “open” and “considerate” as possible throughout the process.\n\n“I think being open minded was the biggest thing. You’re uncomfortable all the time,” she says.\n\n“You’re in environments that are completely new to you. Don’t fall back on your tendencies. Embrace the change. Embrace the openness with open arms.\n\n“Everything about a new experience is going to teach you something better, and you’re going to improve yourself.”\n\nOver the years, she’s managed to build up a network of friends in Munich, and was able to lean on her new found community for support when her beloved mother passed away.\n\n“Having that community was such a big thing…” she says. “My friends were really the basis of my support system. And I think that solidified it for me.”\n\nWhile she misses some aspects of her life in New York, particularly the restaurant scene, the fashion and diversity, Melissa stresses that stepping outside of everything she knew and entering a new space totally on her own has been hugely liberating.\n\nShe has absolutely no regrets about her decision to leave the US, and feels as though she’s grown as a person tremendously during her time in Germany.\n\n“I was always around family and friends my whole life,” she explains. “There was always a method and there was always a person to help me out.\n\n“And in this situation, the only person that could help me was myself… I needed to give myself the opportunity to grow.”', 'Big decision', 'Published 7:38 AM EDT, Thu April 24, 2025', 'the-best-decision-i-ever-made-why-this-new-yorker-ditched-the-united-states-for-super-safe-germany-1745808910'),

Not everyone’s happy about it', 'https://edition.cnn.com/2025/04/23/travel/russians-still-traveling-europe-despite-sanctions/index.html', 'Elizabeth McBride', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-1243906552.jpg?q=w_2000,c_fill', 'The Czech Republic is among several countries that have issued bans on almost all tourist visas for Russian citizens.', 'Since the start of 2022, Russian influencer Egor Melo has been traveling around Europe. Last year, he went to Zurich to see Taylor Swift’s Eras Tour, celebrated New Year’s Eve in Paris, and enjoyed the historical sights of Nuremberg, Germany.\n\nAfter Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, direct flights between Russia and the EU were suspended. In September of the same year, the EU suspended its visa facilitation agreement with Russia, making Russian citizens face a lengthier, more expensive visa approval process to enter the EU.\n\nProcessing fees for Schengen visas — which allow non-EU citizens to travel within the 29-country European Schengen area — have increased due to the suspension of visa-free agreements, some EU countries, many of which border Russia are offering fewer consular appointments for Russians, and the EU has advised member states to scrutinize Russian applications thoroughly.\n\nThe new rules don’t prevent Russian tourists from traveling to Europe — nor is there anything illegal about their trips. It’s just making the process more difficult and expensive.\n\nLatvia, Norway, Poland, Finland, Estonia, Lithuania, and the Czech Republic have gone even further — issuing full bans on almost all tourist visas for Russian citizens.\n\nBut on his Instagram, dedicated “to showing that travel in Europe is accessible to everyone,” Melos claims he’s “been in two of these countries in the past year with a tourist visa and had no problems.”\n\nHis advice? Obtain a visa from another Schengen country. “For example, fly to Italy and from there travel to these countries.”\n\nMelos declined a CNN request to talk about his claims.\n\nThe Baltic states’ ban only applies to Russian citizens who cross the external Schengen border — not entry from other Schengen countries.\n\n“Once you are in the Schengen zone, you can travel within the Schengen zone anywhere, because there is, in principle, no internal control (…) This is not unlawful. This is the Schengen system,” Sarah Ganty, co-author of a 2022 Yale Journal of International Law paper that opposed the visa bans, told CNN.\n\nMelo isn’t alone in continuing to travel. The interior minister for Latvia reportedly condemned data presented at an EU meeting, which stated that 565,069 Schengen visas were issued to Russians in 2024: 90% for tourism. It’s a massive drop from the four million issued pre-pandemic in 2019, but an increase of 25% from 2023. The visa refusal rate for Russians diverges strongly among member states — from 1% to 65% in the first half of 2024, according to an EU report.\n\n“The stabilization of Schengen visa issuance” has contributed to the growth in demand for travel to Europe, the vice president of the Russian Union of Travel Industry (ATOR), claimed in an interview with Russian publication Vedomosti.\n\nOne well-known travel blogger from Russia, who asked to not have their name included for fear of future visa applications being denied, agreed with ATOR. They’ve recently visited Norway — a country that stopped issuing visas to Russian tourists in May 2024.\n\n“Right now, obtaining a visa requires many additional documents that weren’t needed before, such as purchased flight tickets, hotel bookings, or even tax certificates,” they said. “Jokes about needing a doctor’s note (to travel) soon are becoming more common.”\n\nBut they still see travel as accessible.\n\n“Let’s be honest — getting an EU residence permit, like a Spanish digital nomad visa, isn’t that difficult right now. Some people are opting for a three-year EU residence permit instead of a visa, which has also become a common practice,” the blogger said. “For example, if you have children living in the Baltics, the easiest way to get there is through Italy, France or Spain. The scheme is simple: you fly to Rome, spend some time there, and then travel through the Estonia-Russia border after first flying to your relatives.”\n\nNo direct flights means that “Turkey, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia and Serbia” had become the main transit countries for those living in Russia’s West, while “if you live in the Russian Far East, for example, in Vladivostok, it might be easier to fly through China,” according to them. But there are ways to avoid the extra costs when returning to Russia.\n\nEven without an EU residence permit, it is possible to enter Russia through Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland, the travel blogger said.\n\n“That’s why, in the summer, there are long queues at the Narva-Ivangorod border, as flying to Tallinn is cheap, and many people with tourist visas prefer to return via the Estonian-Russian border rather than through, say, Istanbul or Antalya.”\n\nRussian travel companies are still offering tours to countries that have supposedly blocked visas for Russian tourists. For example, one company, YouTravel, is currently offering a 15-day road trip through Finland, Sweden, Norway and Latvia in June. All these countries, apart from Sweden, have banned Russian tourists. The agency says it will assist in obtaining a visa free of charge.\n\nSo how easy is it really to obtain a visa? Asked about the process to obtain a visa to Latvia, which has a complete ban on issuing tourist visas to Russians, a sales assistant at St Petersburg-based agency Visateka said they could help obtain entry “through a third country.” They advised that the easiest document-wise for a June travel date would be France.\n\nFor the equivalent of $300, the sales assistant said Visateka could reserve flights and a hotel, and prepare documents to take to the French embassy for a visa appointment. Visateka claims that for France, Italy and Spain, the chances of having a visa approved were around 93%. Their website claims that in the first two weeks of April, they’ve obtained 20 visas for Russian citizens to enter Latvia, 93 to Lithuania and 20 to Poland.\n\n“Last year, we visited Riga to see the Christmas markets,” Daria from St. Petersburg told CNN. She requested her last name be omitted in fear of her next Schengen visa application being denied. With a Spanish visa, she flew to Istanbul, then to Madrid, before boarding a flight to the Latvian capital on the same day.\n\n“No questions were asked at the airport,” she said about the use of her Spanish visa to visit Riga. “It’s common practice.”\n\n“I’m not part of this war, I don’t support Putin. I don’t understand why I should be discriminated against and treated as if I’m a threat.”\n\nThe Vinsky online travel forum is populated with similar stories. One holder of a French visa shared their experience of flying via Vienna, then taking a plane to Riga in the evening: “I was worried about what to say, but in the end (at Vienna airport) they asked exactly zero questions.”\n\nAnother, who had been granted an Italian tourist visa, said they flew to Rome and then on to Riga. One traveler from Moscow asked, “If you enter Italy with an Italian visa and fly from Milan to Amsterdam a few days later, what are the risks?” Another responded, “Once you get a visa, you’ll be able to travel along the route you’ve planned without any stress.”\n\nRegarding the increase in visas issued in 2024, the EU Commission told CNN that it “closely monitors the implementation of the guidelines through the Blueprint Network.” The Blueprint Network is the EU’s framework for monitoring migration. “The Commission is working with Member States to promote consistent implementation of the guidelines.”\n\nLast year, Hungary extended visa exemptions to Russians and Belarusians, and according to the European Travel Commission’s statistics, Russian arrivals to Hungary increased by a third. In April 2024, Romania restarted issuing short-stay visas to Russian tourists on a discretionary basis after experiencing a drop in tourist revenue, another ETC report states. In early December, Italian visa centers in Moscow reduced processing times for visas.\n\nAs the war grinds into its fourth third year, frustration is growing. Rihards Kozlovskis, Latvia’s minister of internal affairs, has called on EU countries to join Latvia in banning Schengen tourist visas for Russian citizens. Speaking at a meeting of the EU Justice and Home Affairs Council in Brussels, he said it is member states’ “moral duty to deny such a service.”\n\n“We are facing both illegal border crossings and acts of sabotage, such as the burning of the Museum of the Occupation, drones crossing the border, propaganda attempts to influence public opinion, etc.,” Kozlovskis said. “Therefore I urge all member states to take this threat seriously.”\n\nThe Russian travel blogger CNN spoke to said he would be “disappointed” if such sanctions were introduced.\n\n“Russia has its own restrictions on travel to so-called ‘unfriendly’ countries. Police officers, judges and government employees are already prohibited from traveling, so those connected to the state are not going anywhere anyway,” he said. “I don’t think ordinary Russian travelers pose any kind of threat to the Latvian minister with their presence.”\n\nA European Commission spokesperson said that the organization had “adopted clear sets of guidance to support Member States to deprioritize visas for Russians and focus on security and border control. Heightened scrutiny should be performed in a way that preserves the right to seek asylum and prevents risks of non-refoulement.”\n\nGanty, the law academic, argued that such bans were never lawful. She described the de facto national-level ban against Russian citizens — introduced by Poland, Finland and the Baltic States — as a breach of EU law.\n\n“These Russians who are applying for Schengen visas have mainly been depicted as tourists having fun in Europe, but there are lots of people who have family members across the border, there are people who are dissenters, there are health reasons why someone might need a short-stay visa,” she said.\n\n“I think we really need to continue the dialogue with Russian citizens, especially those who are trying to flee the regime and oppose the regime. I think it’s really important to be welcoming towards them.”\n\nWhen Mark Temnycky, a Ukrainian-American and fellow at the Atlantic Council’s Eurasia Center, visited Montenegro in 2023 with his cousins, he was surprised at the number of Russians who were also there — and the reaction they got from the Russians while posing with a Ukrainian flag by St John’s Fortress, a historic landmark overlooking the town of Kotor.\n\n“We got some looks and stares from Russian speakers who were making comments (…) we’re just taking photos with the flag,” he said.\n\n“In Greece, as well as in Cyprus, when I was there in August of 2023, it was still very heavily visited by ethnic Russians and Russian speakers who were on holiday there and just again — from a moral perspective — it just did not sit with me that these people are supporting the country’s war and then go on vacation.\n\n“I have many family and friends in Ukraine who haven’t been on vacation in several years because they don’t know where to go, and many of them are not permitted to leave the country and fear for their safety. It’s very strange.”\n\nHe said he wants the EU to go further with bans on tourist visas.\n\n“I would argue that European countries aren’t doing this to punish the Russians, just for the sake of punishing the Russians. It’s to explore other avenues to put additional pressures on Russia. And I think at this point, you gotta get creative, and if this is another way to do that, then I think there’s no harm in trying to see what happens.”', 'Getting a permit ‘isn’t that difficult’', 'Updated 4:51 AM EDT, Thu April 24, 2025', 'russians-are-still-traveling-around-europe-despite-sanctions-not-everyones-happy-about-it-1745808910'),

However, he added that he believes the crowd numbers will be similar to those for Benedict’s funeral: “I don’t expect numbers even close to [the funeral of] Pope John Paul II.” Around four million mourners flocked to Rome for the 2005 death of John Paul II.\n\nThe conclave — the meeting of cardinals to elect a new pope, usually two or three weeks after the previous pontiff’s death — will “be a big draw for people to come to Rome,” said Butorac, adding that unlike in the case of Benedict, time-strapped mourners may have to choose between traveling to Rome for the funeral or the conclave.\n\nPope Francis’ funeral is scheduled for Saturday April 26 at 10 a.m.\n\nBefore the funeral, there will be a period of lying in state. Francis’ coffin was transferred from his papal residence at the Casa Santa Marta to St. Peter’s Basilica early on Wednesday, April 23.\n\nFollowing a ceremony inside the basilica, the public will be able to file past the coffin. The basilica will be open until midnight Wednesday, from 7 a.m. to midnight Thursday, and from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. Friday. At 8 p.m. there will be a ceremony for the closing of the coffin.\n\nThe funeral, at 10 a.m. on Saturday, will take place in St. Peter’s Square outside the basilica, and will be open to the public. Tickets are not required — but expect extremely long lines. There will be a final Commendation and Valediction, before Francis’ coffin is taken inside St. Peter’s Basilica for the remainder of the service.\n\nHis body will then be taken to Rome’s Basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore, just over two miles east of St. Peter’s, for burial. The route has not yet been announced.\n\nThe religious elements of a pope’s funeral are laid out in the “Ordo Exsequiarum Romani Pontificis” (Latin for “Funeral Rites for the Roman Pontiff”). However, popes can still weigh in on plans, as Francis did when he approved an updated edition of the liturgical book in 2024. Francis wrote in his 2025 autobiography, “Hope,” that the proposed funeral was “excessive” and that he arranged to “lighten” it. He also chose his burial place, and will be the first pope in over a century to be laid to rest outside the Vatican. He regularly worshiped at Santa Maria Maggiore, and last made a surprise visit there on April 12.\n\nVatican rules stipulate that the pope must be buried between the fourth and sixth day after his death. The funeral then officially triggers nine days of mourning known as the “Novendiales,” which will see masses for Pope Francis held daily until May 4.\n\nDuring this period, cardinals from across the world will be arriving in Rome, ready for the conclave, the date for which has not yet been announced.\n\n“Every cardinal has a titular church here, and so usually two days before the conclave begins, they will have a Mass at their church,” said Butorac.\n\n“The day before the conclave, there is a Mass in St. Peter’s Basilica. This is also open to the public. All the cardinals will be there. After this, they head into the Sistine Chapel, not to be seen in public again until the election of the pope.”\n\nThe conclave to elect the next pope can start no sooner than 15 days after the previous pope’s death (which would be May 6), though the exact date will be determined by cardinals in the days ahead.\n\nDuring the conclave, while the cardinals are secreted away in the Sistine Chapel, crowds gather in St. Peter’s Square to pray, hoping to be there when they see white smoke emerging from the Sistine Chapel, meaning that a new pope has been chosen.\nShortly afterwards, the newly elected pope will greet the crowds in the square from his balcony.\n\nYou don’t need a ticket to be in the square, but you will need to pass through security to access it, said Butorac.\n\nFor those who wish to witness it, on day one of the conclave, there is just one vote, in the evening. On the following days, there are four votes: two in the morning, two in the late afternoon. Twice a day, until a pope has been elected, the ballots will be burned. Black smoke emerging from the Sistine Chapel means no pope has been chosen. White means there is a new pope.\n\nThe pattern of voting continues each day with a break every five days until a new Bishop of Rome is selected. Once that happens, the ballots are immediately burned to produce the white smoke.\n\n“The times are usually public, so people know when to be in the square,” said Butorac. “There are also no seats — so expect to stand for hours.” The voting can take hours, so be prepared to wait.\n\nRome has two international airports. Fiumicino, around 17 miles (27 kilometers) southwest of the city center, is Italy’s busiest airport and the hub for non-European airlines.\nCiampino, southeast of the city, is much smaller and closer to central Rome. It currently serves budget airlines with intra-European routes as well as two destinations in Morocco.\n\nFrom Fiumicino, the Leonardo Express train departs every 15 minutes for Termini station in the city center. Alternatively, taxis charge a fixed rate of 55 euros ($58) to destinations within the city walls. Buses to Termini take 50 minutes and cost 9.90 euros ($10.40) return.\n\nFrom Ciampino, a taxi costs a fixed 40 euros ($42), or buses to Termini take 40 minutes and cost 9.90 euros.\n\nWhile flying into Rome is obviously direct, it’s worth considering flying into other major Italian airports, too. Rome’s Termini station is a hub on Italy’s high-speed railway line, meaning Milan is just over three hours away, and Naples around an hour.\n\nRome will be incredibly busy, so it makes sense to stay near St. Peter’s — though be aware that hotels are already heavily booked throughout 2025 because of the Jubilee. Vatican City sits on the west side of the Tiber, across the river from the historical center of Rome. The rione (district) of Prati is right above it, and is your best bet, accommodation-wise. Campo Marzio, in the historic center, is just across the water — anywhere near Campo de’ Fiori or Piazza Navona is also an easy walk to the Vatican.\n\nNot finding anything? The nearest metro stop to the Vatican is at Ottaviano. Stay anywhere around Piazza di Spagna (the Spanish Steps) or the cheaper areas around Piazza della Repubblica and Termini train station, and you’ll be just a few minutes away by metro.\n\nWhile many hotels appear to have hiked room rates over the next few days, there are some with availability at more reasonable prices. Checking Booking.com on Tuesday after the funeral and lying in state was announced, there were various two- and three-star hotels around Termini for around 500 euros ($574) for three nights from Wednesday to Saturday. This isn’t the time to go all out with a five star — the luxury Bvlgari hotel, for example, which is within walking distance from the Vatican, was selling rooms for the same dates (three nights) for 8,310 euros ($9,539).\n\nIf you’re looking for just one night and the pickings are looking slim, it could work out as more affordable to stay longer. For example, Hotel Lancelot, a family-owned three-star near the Colosseum, has implemented a three-day minimum stay during the lying-in-state and funeral period; however, it has not raised its reasonable rates. A single room for three nights is 420 euros ($482) as of Tuesday.\n\nVatican City is one of the most popular places to visit on a Rome trip, but this is a time when it shuts down its tourism operations and returns the buildings to what they were built for. The Sistine Chapel, for example, will hold the conclave, while St. Peter’s will be used for the lying in state. The museums will also be closed on Saturday 26 April, and all tours of the Vatican Gardens and the Necropolis of the Via Triumphalis are suspended, according to a statement on the Musei Vaticani website.\n\nInstead, if you have time to sightsee, you’ll need to leave Vatican City — but there are still plenty of sites with papal links in Rome. A 10-minute walk from St. Peter’s Square is the colossal Castel Sant’Angelo, originally built as the mausoleum of the emperor Hadrian, and then used as a papal fortress. It was here that Pope Clement VII holed up during the Sack of Rome in 1527, eventually escaping the city.\n\nIf you’re here to pay respects to Francis, you’ll probably want to spend some time in church. Luckily, Rome’s basilicas are museums in their own right, so you’ll be sightseeing as you go. Prime amongst them are the city’s three other “papal basilicas” — which rank just below St. Peter’s for importance to the Catholic Church. San Giovanni in Laterano, Santa Maria Maggiore and San Paolo Fuori le Mura each have a “porta santa” (holy door), and a papal altar. The latter, at the end of the increasingly trendy Via Ostiense, is said to be the resting place of the apostle St. Paul.\n\nBe aware that as the resting place of the pope, Santa Maria Maggiore will likely be subject to visiting restrictions around the date of the funeral. No information has been announced as of yet.\n\nIf you want to mix in some Michelangelo, there are several options in lieu of St. Peter’s.\nHis formidable Moses statue in San Pietro in Vincoli, a church in Monti, is a match for the Pietà in St. Peter’s — and in fact it was designed for the funerary monument of Pope Julius II, an ill-fated project that Michelangelo only completed after the death of Julius.\n\nThe spectacular church of Santa Maria degli Angeli is a ruined Roman bath that Michelangelo redesigned as a church — while his Risen Christ statue stands in Santa Maria Sopra Minerva, the church behind the Pantheon.\n\nTwo of the most spectacular papal sites are located outside the capital. Castel Gandolfo was the pope’s summer residence from 1596 until Francis wound it down, preferring to live more simply. Since 2016, you can visit the Palazzo Apostolico, or Palazzo Papale (papal palace) — as well as its beautiful gardens with spectacular views over Lake Albano. It’s currently open to the public daily (check the website for opening times) although it will be closed on Saturday 26 April as a sign of mourning.\n\nIn Viterbo, around 100 minutes by train north of Rome, is the Palazzo dei Papi, or Palace of the Popes. From 1257 to 1281, the Curia was moved here from Rome, and a suitably grand papal palace was built for the occasion — which is open to visitors today. The city carried on being a favorite escape for popes even when they were based back in Rome — one 15th century pontiff even added a bathhouse to take full advantage of Viterbo’s famous thermal waters.', 'The schedule', 'Published 9:04 AM EDT, Wed April 23, 2025', 'how-to-visit-rome-for-pope-francis-funeral-1745808910'),

The sun won’t rise for another hour, but Sophie Crowther, having slept through her alarm, is sprinting up winding icy mountain lanes to make breakfast for 25 high-paying guests.\n\nIt’s her first day working in the mountains. Just a few days ago, she received a call informing her she was going to be parachuted in to work as a chef in a luxury chalet. Her welcome party the night before still ringing in her ears, she makes it to the chalet with her guests none the wiser.\n\n“I was literally throwing up as I was making eggs and bacon for everyone,” she told CNN. “Unfortunate.”\n\nThis is the reality of the glamorous, and not-so-glamorous, lives of “chalet girls” — the staff catering to every whim of the rich and famous in Europe’s most luxurious ski chalets.\n\nEach ski season, hundreds of mainly young people flock to the Alps, Dolomites and Pyrenees to work as chefs, cleaners, drivers, nannies and concierges to snow-seeking tourists paying heavily for the privilege.\n\nIf you’re one of the growing number of Americans heading to Europe for a cheaper ski holiday, you will likely have been confronted by them, both on the slopes and in the apres-ski bars long after the skiing is done.\n\nThey’re often derided as posh girls on a luxury gap year with a reputation of skiing all day and partying all night, but the reality for most is less glamorous.\n\n“Chalet girls” are an institution in Europe’s most luxurious ski resorts. A small cohort of the millions employed in Europe’s winter sports industry, but one synonymous with the luxury chalets of Chamonix, St Anton and Courchevel, to name a few.\n\nEmerging from a combination of the increasing affordability of foreign vacations in the 1960s and 70s, and the decline of the British aristocracy’s ability to maintain large properties across Europe, a ski season working as a chalet host became an avenue of adventure for girls recently released from the shackles of the British boarding school system.\n\nWages were low, the hours were long and the drinks in the local bars were cheap. The term “chalet girl” began to enter the British popular consciousness, carrying with it a hedonistic reputation for dominating the bars and nightclubs of the French Alps.\n\nThe job continues to provide an opportunity to spend months skiing in the world’s most exclusive resorts and be paid for the pleasure.\n\n“It’s crazy. I remember Gordon Ramsay was staying in the chalet opposite David Beckham was staying,” India Hogg told CNN about her time working in a luxury chalet in France’s Courchevel 1850.\n\n“It was a mental, different world.”\n\nBut, do current “chalet girls” deserve the reputation laid down by their forebears?\n\nThe 2011 film “Chalet Girl” stands as a monument to how many perceive the profession. Tamsin Egerton portrays Georgie as the archetypal chalet girl: posh, airheaded, flirtatious with guests and mainly interested in drinking into the wee hours.\n\n“That film bears absolutely no relationship whatsoever to the industry today,” VIP Ski’s Andy Sturt told CNN.\n\nFor a start, the role is no longer the preserve of privately educated girls from the south of England.\n\nPast and present chalet hosts CNN spoke to for this piece said that, while the role is still predominantly female, a growing number of chalet hosts are men.\n\nA female host currently working in a luxury chalet at a French resort, who spoke to CNN anonymously because she was not authorized by her employer to talk to the media, said her team was “majoritarily girls, but not by a landslide.”\n\nSeveral luxury chalet providers report having an even gender split among their staff. VIP Ski’s Sturt told CNN the historical characterization of the chalet girl has been “gently eroded away over the past 20-odd years.”\n\nThe industry, according to those who work in it, has become increasingly professional since it developed its firmly held reputation and gaining a place as a chalet host is now fiercely competitive.\n\nLuxury ski chalet company Consensio Chalets receives around 15 applications for every available position, the company’s co-founder and managing director Ceri Tinley told CNN. This gives those applying to the prestigious Oxford University in the UK a higher rate of success than those applying to work as chalet hosts.\n\n“We’ve got for this forthcoming winter about 240 positions overseas. And last year, we had 2,000 applications,” Sturt told CNN.\n\n“This year, we’ve already had 500 applications, and we haven’t even finished the winter. So what’s happened is the demand for the few jobs that are available is huge, and it’s very, very hard now to get the job in catered chalet holidays in the Alps.”\n\nTravel and work restrictions introduced in recent years — particularly as a result of the UK’s exit from the European Union — have meant that many companies are looking to hire those with dual-nationality passports and a number of companies folded altogether.\n\n“Brexit has shifted the landscape,” Tinley told CNN.\n\n“While it’s still possible to hire UK nationals, the need for work permits and visas means we now primarily recruit those with EU passports or a French Carte de Séjour (residence permit).”\n\nDespite their quintessentially British reputation, chalet workers’ British contingent has been “getting smaller and smaller and smaller because it’s harder and harder to do seasons” since Brexit, the chalet worker in France told CNN. “And the tour operators that were here before that mostly did hire British now aren’t here anymore. So I think, yes, it is really dwindling.“\n\n“The size of the industry is maybe 25% of what it was 10 years ago,” Sturt told CNN.\n\nThe increasing professionalism and competition for roles have meant that the hard-partying reputation of chalet staff is less deserved than in seasons gone by.\n\n“I’ve had a week where I’d get about three hours sleep,” the chalet worker in France told CNN, but added “you can’t look terrible, smelling of alcohol in front of these amazing, fantastic guests. You have to have it together, so there is a limit to what you can do.”\n\nHowever, chalet staff interviewed for this piece stressed that whilst the hedonistic sides of the job had decreased, they had not gone away altogether.\n\n“I’d say, definitely we let off some steam,” Crowther, the former luxury French chalet chef, told CNN. “You’ve got to let go, because you’re just, you’re looking after people all day, every day.”\n\nSince their earliest days, “chalet girls” have been viewed as exclusively descending from the upper classes.\n\n“If you go back to the birth of chalet holidays, they were the children of aristocracy,” Sturt told CNN. “They were looking after mummy and daddy’s house or mum and daddy’s friend’s house.”\n\nHow much this remains the case is hard to tell.\n\n“This stereotype doesn’t align with our recruitment experience,” Tinley told CNN.\n\nSkiing is an expensive sport, and factors like climate change making lower altitude resorts unviable are only adding to the price tag. With pay limited, a major appeal of the job is its access to the slopes, so it naturally attracts experienced skiers.\n\n“A lot of people are from very privileged backgrounds, especially if you’re a Brit doing it,” the chalet worker in France said of the background of her coworkers, adding that British guests “probably are expecting someone quite posh” to be working as chalet staff.\n\n“Skiing is becoming extremely expensive,” Sturt told CNN, adding “You’re not going to come into a ski season without some understanding or involvement in the ski sector, and necessarily that means that your family has an element of wealth.”\n\nThere is no disputing the opulence of the chalets in which these people work. Saunas, wine cellars, priceless artworks and even raclette rooms dedicated to serving up melted cheese are not uncommon.\n\n“Our clients expect to enjoy luxurious accommodation combined with exceptional service,” Tinley of Consensio Chalets told CNN, adding that guests look for “properties equipped with facilities like hot tubs, swimming pools and cinemas, complemented by attentive staff who anticipate their needs.”\n\nWhile their guests are living in the lap of luxury, the same can’t be said for the chalet hosts.\n\n“You are in the luxury sector, but you are not the guest,” a current chalet host told CNN.\n\nThe morning commute is often a 20-30 minute early morning hike up a mountain in the snow. During her time working as a chef in a luxury chalet in French resort Les Gets, Crowther was staying in accommodation underneath a bar. “We literally couldn’t sleep until like 4 a.m. some days,” she told CNN. “We’d have to have earplugs in. And the bond of not being able to sleep just really brought us together.”\n\nDays generally start before 7 a.m. and frequently end after midnight. In that time, staff prepare the guests’ meals, ski gear and drinks, clean, make beds and more, trying to fit in some time on the slopes when they can.\n\nGuests paying upwards of $3,000 per person expect their every conceivable need to be taken care of.\n\n“You can’t say no, it’s that sort of high-level service,” Hogg said of her time working as a host in a luxury chalet.\n\nThose who attempt to make use of the chalet’s facilities while their guests are on the slopes are liable to find themselves without a job or accommodation.\n\nWhen it comes to hiring chalet staff, “it’s all about personality,” Sturt told CNN.\n\n“They need to have personality and depth of character and experience to be able to host the dinner party every night. That’s the fundamental essence of it. So they need to be able to do all the details, all the domestic chores, but really it’s all about personality.”\n\nPay is generally not particularly high, with some reporting their monthly pay to be around £1,000 ($1,325) — potentially less than UK minimum wage considering the hours. This is generally topped up by tips which can be more than a monthly salary. Accommodation and ski gear and passes are also usually included in the package.\n\nThe long hours and demanding guests can put a strain on chalet staff, many of whom will be away from home for the first time in their lives.\n\n“I definitely had highs and very low lows,” Hogg told CNN. “I remember walking into a bedroom, and it was an absolute (mess). And I was like, I can’t do this.\n\n“But I’ve got to remind myself I’m in the mountains, and I think it’s that high and low that really gets me through it.”', 'Who are the “chalet girls?”', 'Updated 4:50 AM EDT, Wed April 23, 2025', 'the-truth-about-the-chalet-girls-who-look-after-the-needs-of-europes-wealthy-skiers-1745808910');

The pillars are the result of lava cooling and contracting over millions of years.\n\nSister formations can be found at Fingal’s Cave in Staffa, Scotland, all part of the same lava flow.\n\nThe large, spherical Moeraki Boulders could easily be mistaken for man-made creations that have washed up on Koekohe Beach on the North Otago coast.\n\nLocal Maori legend claims they are the remnants of fishing baskets and fruits that came ashore when their Araiteuru Canoe was wrecked bringing their ancestors to New Zealand’s South Island.\n\nIn truth, these two-meter-high stones were created by mudstone hardening over five million years, before appearing as surrounding rocks were eroded.\n\nAt 300 meters wide (984 feet) and around 125 meters deep (410 feet), the Great Blue Hole is the biggest sinkhole in the world.\n\nPart of the Belize Barrier Reef System, the hole was formed as sea levels rose thousands of years ago, flooding its deep caves.\n\nMade famous by renowned marine explorer Jacques Cousteau, recent submarine trips have created new 3D sonar maps, showing never-before-seen mineral formations close to the hole’s bottom.\n\nIn the brief period between Colombia’s wet and dry seasons, the waters of Caño Cristales become a riot of red, yellow and green.\n\nThis vibrant occurrence is due to Macarenia clavigera, a plant found on the riverbed.\n\nIt only turns red between September and November, which is after the fast-flowing water of the wet season abates, but before the dry season evaporates too much water for it to keep its colorful look.\n\nSwimmers are allowed in certain sections, but can’t wear sunscreen in order to protect the fragile ecosystem.\n\nDead Vlei, literally dead marsh, sits among the tallest sand dunes in the world, with some as high as 400 meters.\n\nOnce abundant, the now almost barren area is home to a vast stand of dead Camel Thorn trees, dried out because of an intense change in climate 900 years ago.\n\nThe dry weather means they cannot decompose, creating a truly eerie landscape.\n\nThe rolling Chocolate Hills of Bohol in the Philippines could easily be mistaken for a child’s landscape drawing.\n\nBut these 1,268 hills are very much a natural phenomenon: conical limestone peaks formed through the actions of water and erosion over thousands of years.\n\nTheir name derives from their grass covering, which turns brown during the dry season, with December to March the best time to visit. Legend has it the hills are the dried tears of a heartbroken giant. While the truth is more prosaic, the views are still spectacular.\n\nThe most active volcano on the island of Hawaii, Kilauea is in a state of near constant eruption, molten lava oozing down roads and destroying homes and holiday resorts.\n\nAfter a three-month hiatus in activity, it sprang back into life in late 2024, drawing tourist crowds to see dramatic spouts of bright orange lava reach over 90 meters (300 feet).\n\nBelieved to be between 210,000 and 280,000 years old , it surfaced above sea level on the southern eastern shore of the island around 100,000 years ago.\n\nJust a few meters from the sand and surf on the coast of Middle Island, in Australia’s Recherche Archipelago, Lake Hillier’s brash pink water is in stark contrast to the bright blue of the nearby ocean.\n\nIts color is thought to be derived from algae called Dunaliella salina, which produces a pigment that turns the salty water a seemingly unnatural hue.\n\nHalophilic bacteria in the salt crusts that surround its banks are also considered to be behind the phenomenon.\n\nProtruding high from the prairie into the Wyoming sky, Devils Tower (the apostrophe omitted ever since it was given the name in the 19th century) is sacred to several Native American tribes.\n\nA butte rising some 385 meters above the Belle Fourche River, it was formed by surrounding sedimentary rocks eroding, leaving the igneous rocks to stand sentinel over the area.\n\nThe Lakota believe Devils Tower rose to protect two girls from a chasing bear, the marks surrounding the tower left by its claws.\n\nSci-fi aficionados will recognize it as the alien rendezvous point from Steven Spielberg’s 1977 movie “Close Encounters of the Third Kind.”\n\nWith temperatures averaging a blistering 94 degrees Fahrenheit, Dallol is one of the most inhospitable places on Earth.\n\nClose to the border with Eritrea, its ethereal, Martian landscape sits within the Danakil Depression.\n\nBesides its ungodly heat, Dallol is best known for its colorful hydrothermal fields, with aquamarine green pools and yellow rocks appearing like a surrealist painting against the florid red rock formations.\n\nThe bright colors are due to inorganic iron oxidation.\n\nKnown also as the Richat Structure, the Eye of the Sahara looks pretty much like any other part of this continent-straddling desert from the ground. But from up in space, this 40-kilometer (24-mile) wide geological marvel is something else.\n\nBelieved to be an eroded dome, rather than an impact crater, it resembles a fossilized ammonite when seen from Earth’s orbit.\n\nHigh in Japan’s northern Tohoku region, Mount Zao is home to this vast swathe of icy sculptures. As winter comes on hard and harsh, Siberian winds blow across the Zao range and snow falls and freezes on the mountain’s trees.\n\nThe trees then freeze into interesting forms, resembling creatures straight out of a manga comic.\n\nRegular light shows help add to their allure after dark, although a cable car across their peaks in daylight is just as fascinating.\n\nThe clue’s in the name of this vast area in northern Argentina: lunar landscapes of wind blasted rock, where the night skies are illuminated by billions of stars and the moon glows.\n\nAlso known as the Ischigualasto Provincial Park, its most famous sights include The Sphinx, which resembles its Ancient Egyptian namesake.\n\nThere’s also The Mushroom, a tower that blooms out into a wide formation at its summit and the Bowling Field, where spherical rocks dot the landscape.\n\nJust south of the Utah state line, Vermilion Cliffs is one of the most visually arresting places in the United States.\n\nThe area’s swirling sandstone canyons and arches are ripe for exploration, with few visitors likely to be encountered.\n\nThe vast cliffs themselves, which run for 48 kilometers and range between 2,000 and 3,000 feet, can be seen in all their glory from Highway 89A.\n\nIceland’s geothermic wonders make it a paradise for seekers of weird and wonderful landscapes, especially following a bout of increased activity in late 2024.\n\nMost famous for its Geysir and Strokkur erupting hot springs, this vast area, 60 kilometers east of Reykjavik, is worth taking time to explore, especially as there’s a handy campsite close by.\n\nMentions of the bubbling, geothermal fields here date back to 1294, when they were activated by an earthquake.\n\nNorway’s Trollkirka Caves, literally Troll Church Caves, aren’t places of worship in the traditional sense. Instead, they’re marble and limestone marvels that intrepid visitors can enter after a strenuous hike.\n\nThe key attraction here is the 70-meter main cave, which boasts a waterfall. Smaller grottoes play home to sparkling pools, the water bright and clear against the white rock, which appears to have folded in on itself over millions of years.\n\nFar less popular than nearby Grand Canyon National Park, Bryce Canyon is arguably every bit as extraordinary.\n\nIt appears red, white and yellow against the bright blue sky thanks to the “hoodoos” that stand to attention for miles in every direction.\n\nThese columns, made of soft rock at the bottom and harder rock at the top, are the result of millennia of weathering and erosion. They sit within a series of huge natural amphitheaters that look spectacular at sunset.\n\nThe lowest point on Earth, the Dead Sea is more than nine times saltier than the sea.\n\nThought to be part of a rift zone that extends north into Turkey, it’s believed to have once been part of a lagoon connected to the Mediterranean.\n\nSalt deposits on its bottom ensure that bathers remain buoyant, while the water’s rejuvenating properties have made it a go to for health tourists for centuries.\n\nIn the heart of British Columbia, Spotted Lake looks like your average body of freshwater during winter. But as temperatures rise and the water evaporates, it becomes something wholly different.\n\nHuge blue, yellow and green spots appear, the result of deposits of magnesium sulphates, sodium sulphates and calcium.\n\nThe Okanagan First Nations people believed the spots to have different curative properties and have owned the surrounding land since 2001.\n\nFlowing from Antarctica’s Taylor Glacier, Blood Falls’ ghoulish color is rooted in deep time.\n\nIn 2017, scientists discovered the scarlet hue is due to oxidized iron in brine saltwater, which has taken one and a half million years to get to the falls, rather than discoloration by algae as previously thought.\n\nWhen the water makes contact with oxygen, it oxidizes and turns red.\n\nA brine lake underneath the glacier, exposed to iron rich rocks, is believed to be the water’s source.\n\nThe “Rainbow Mountains” of the Zhangye Danxia Landform Geological Park are striking examples of what millions of years of geological activity can do to a landscape.\n\nMade up of layers of sandstone, mudstone and multicolored sedimentary rocks laid down over millions of years, their sharp tilt is due to the movement of the tectonic plates which also formed the Himalaya.\n\nRiver erosion helped form the deep gorges and high peaks, with purple, green, yellow and red strata creating a brash and bright vista.\n\nKnown by locals as the Door to Hell, the Darvaza Gas Crater is a natural phenomenon brought about by man less than half a century ago.\n\nWhile searching for oil, Soviet engineers discovered a natural gas pocket that soon collapsed, consuming their equipment.\n\nPanicked by the release of methane potentially killing wildlife in the surrounding Karakum Desert, scientists set the gas crater alight in the hope it would soon burn out.\n\nToday, it still burns brightly, to a depth of 30 meters, although some observers say its flames are diminishing. It’s still a major draw for tourists heading to this little-visited country in Central Asia.\n\nThis story was originally published in June 2019.

And its runway is melting', 'https://edition.cnn.com/travel/svalbard-airport-norway-northermost-melting/index.html', '', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/shutterstock-editorial-1310548a.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_833,w_1480,c_fill', 'Svalbard Airport is the world\'s most northerly landing strip for scheduled commercial flights.', 'The frozen expanses of the Arctic are fast becoming some of the world’s hotspots.\n\nPresident Donald Trump’s bid for Greenland, and growing Russian and Chinese interest in opening the sea lanes along Siberia’s northern coast, have put these remote regions in the spotlight.\n\nBut the Arctic’s newfound popularity is not all about geopolitics. Destinations along the Arctic Circle, from Alaska to Lapland, are reporting record visitor numbers as adventurous travelers seek the thrill of exploring the planet’s ultimate frontiers.\n\nA Swedish startup called OceanSky Cruises is even planning to run luxury airship journeys to the North Pole, although there’s no launch date in sight.\n\nBut while the apex of our planet may remain beyond the reach of the average traveler for quite some time, some airlines can fly incredibly close to it.\n\nOne of the most extreme pieces of land on this planet, as far as latitude is concerned, is actually quite easy to get to.\n\nSvalbard Airport, on Norway’s Svalbard archipelago, is the world’s northernmost airport with scheduled commercial flights.\n\nTwo airlines, SAS and Norwegian, fly year-round between the airport in Longyearbyen, the main settlement on the islands, and the Norwegian mainland, more than 800 kilometers (500 miles) to the south.\n\nThe airport regularly welcomes charter flights and private jets too, such is the allure of its unique geographical location.\n\nThe Arctic is one of the world’s most environmentally fragile regions and the team at Svalbard Airport has already had a first taste of the effects of climate change.\n\nWhen Longyearbyen’s 2,300-meter-long runway was built in the early 1970s, no one expected the permafrost layer it was constructed on to start melting. But that is exactly what’s happening now.\n\nPermafrost is defined as ground that’s remained frozen for at least two years. The heating and thawing of permafrost has become a significant issue for Svalbard, with the resulting instability and subsidence affecting buildings and infrastructure and increasing the risk of landslides and avalanches.\n\n“During the summer months we must check the runway meticulously every day, because the soil might subside at any point. This is a challenge that we only expect to get worse with time,” Ragnhild Kommisrud, the airport’s manager, tells CNN by phone.\n\nIt’s hard to overestimate the importance of that runway for Svalbard’s 2,500 or so inhabitants. Were it to close down, most of their essential supplies would have to arrive by ship, a journey that can take up to two days each way.\n\n“We always keep extra staff and material here at the airport, because if something breaks down, we must be able to repair it ourselves, without outside help,” says Kommisrud. For instance, after the local power plant malfunctioned, she says emergency generators had to be sent from the mainland on a C-17 Globemaster military cargo aircraft.\n\nPower generation has long been a sensitive issue on Svalbard.\n\nOn the one hand, the local community has a vested interest in helping prevent global warming and preserving the archipelago’s pristine nature. On the other hand, until very recently, much of the local economy was running almost entirely on coal.\n\nDespite its remoteness, Svalbard is endowed with rich coal deposits right next to deep ice-free fjords, making it a suitable place for mining.\n\nUnder the Svalbard Treaty of 1920 – signed by countries including the US, Japan and many European Union nations — Norway has sovereignty over the islands but other signatory countries have the right to develop economic activities on the archipelago as well.\n\nAs a result, Norway, Sweden and the Soviet Union (and later, Russia) established mining operations in the area in the first half of the 20th century.\n\nIn times of heightened environmental sensitivities — particularly in a country like Norway, whose mainland is powered almost entirely by renewable energy sources — this dependency on coal has been a sore spot in recent times.\n\nOver the last decade the Norwegian-operated mines have been winding down their production. Sveagruva, one of the largest and most productive mines on Svalbard, was shut in 2020 and the area was rewilded. A Russian-operated coal mine at Barentsburg, the island’s second-largest settlement, remains open but is reportedly reducing production.\n\nSvalbard has also been a major coal consumer, burning it to produce heating and electricity for the local community. Moving onto alternative power sources was not just a matter of becoming greener; the future of the community depended on it.\n\nIn 2023, Longyearbyen’s coal-fired power station was finally shut down. Its replacement was a new diesel-powered plant, an imperfect solution on account of its still high carbon footprint, but one that, nevertheless, managed to cut carbon emissions nearly in half.\n\nHowever, this was still not good enough for Avinor, Norway’s government-owned airport operator, which manages Longyearbyen and more than 40 other airports throughout the Scandinavian country.\n\nAvinor is expected to play a central role in the ambitious decarbonization strategy Norway has laid out for its aviation sector. It has committed to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 42% by 2030 in relation to 2022 levels and by 90% by 2050.\n\nSomething had to be done to bring down emissions at Avinor’s northernmost airport, which, despite its limited activity, accounted for a big chunk of the company’s carbon footprint. The solution is coming in the form of yet another new power plant, this one exclusive to the airport and powered by biogas.\n\nIf all goes according to plan, this new plant is expected to enter service towards the end of 2025 or early 2026, subject to the completion of the ongoing governmental approval process.\n\nHege Ringnes, senior climate advisor at Avinor, tells CNN that biogas produced on the mainland using renewable energy has a relatively low carbon footprint, even when shipping is taken into account.\n\nThe airport plant will then be connected to Longyearbyen’s electricity grid and act as an additional resource in the hypothetical case that the town’s diesel plant needs a backup. So hopefully next time it won’t be necessary for the military to send a C-17 loaded with generators.\n\nIntriguingly, though Svalbard spends four months a year in total darkness, it has had a solar power plant since 2015.\n\n“True, it is not operative for part of the year, but in summer, the tables turn and we get almost 24 hours of uninterrupted daylight,” explains Kommisrud. In fact, she adds, solar power harvesting works better under cooler temperatures so the arctic conditions make this plant particularly productive when the sun shines.\n\nWith coal mostly gone, Svalbard has turned to tourism as its major economic activity.\n\n“Svalbard used to be an extreme tourism destination, catering to the most adventurous travelers. It is still pretty niche, but we are becoming more mainstream,” says Ronny Brunvoll, CEO of Visit Svalbard, an association representing more than 70 private tourism-related businesses.\n\nSummer has traditionally been peak season, when several cruise companies run expeditions to the region. However, the season is being extended as more people are coming to Svalbard in winter, to enjoy the Northern Lights, as well as in early spring, when days get longer but it’s still possible to enjoy outdoor activities such as dog-sledding and snowmobile tours.\n\nTouring Svalbard comes with some important caveats, though. Brunvoll has some words of caution about the realities on the ground and why visitors are not advised to leave town without a guide.\n\n“There’s a very real chance to come across a polar bear. Then, there’s the weather, which can change very abruptly. It can be brutal. And if something happens, don’t expect to have mobile signal in most places. You must be prepared and know what you are doing.”\n\nDespite these limitations, the dangers of overtourism are very present in everyone’s minds. The number of lodgings on Svalbard has been capped at 500 rooms and is expected to remain this way for the foreseeable future.\n\nTourism may well be Svalbard’s new coal, but both the tourism industry and the authorities appear to be well aware of their duty to protect the untamed wilderness that makes these islands such a fascinating place.', 'A vital link to a fragile place', 'Published 9:49 AM EDT, Mon April 21, 2025', 'its-the-worlds-northernmost-airport-and-its-runway-is-melting-1745808910'),

Suddenly it is broken by a ladder falling from the sky.\n\nMilan Pandey is sitting back down at Everest Base Camp, looking out over views that few have ever seen — and he got there without having to pull on a crampon or wield an ice ax. He is a drone pilot, and his work may change things on the world’s highest mountain forever.\n\nThe ladders, ropes and oxygen cylinders that Pandey can transport via drone to aid the Sherpas or “icefall doctors” at Khumbu Icefall, a glacier located between Base Camp and Camp One, could likely save lives on the mountain.\n\nSpecialist Sherpas who hail from the nearby hills and mountains have been navigating and setting the trail for climbers on Everest for seven decades. Dozens have lost their lives in the process. Pandey, of Airlift Technology, a local drone-mapping start-up, believes that with his technical expertise in using drones combined with the Sherpas’ decades of mountaineering knowledge, they can make it safer to be on the roof of the world.\n\nBase Camp is located at a height of about 5,364 meters (17,598 ft) above sea level and Camp One at 6,065 meters (19,900 feet).\n\nThe aerial distance between the two points is roughly 1.8 miles. It takes Sherpas six to seven hours to make this journey, but it takes a drone about six to seven minutes.\n\nMingma G Sherpa of Imagine Nepal, an expedition company that’s been guiding climbers for nearly a decade, recognized the need for this kind of assistance when he lost three of his friends and mountain guides in an avalanche in 2023. Their bodies could not be recovered.\n\n“They had to keep going up and down the mountain twenty times to first figure out the route and then come back for the equipment. I had heard they use drones in China to help with this on another mountain, so I thought ‘why not here?’” he said.\n\nAround the same time, Raj Bikram, CEO of Airlift Nepal, was in touch with the Khumbu municipality for 3D-mapping Mount Everest using drones when the region’s mayor asked how much weight the drones could carry. In April 2024, with the help of two drones donated by China’s DJI, and working with the Sagarmatha (Nepal’s name for Everest) Pollution Control Committee, Airlift began experimenting.\n\n“In the beginning, because it was also our first time at the Everest Base Camp, we were not sure how the drone would perform at that altitude and at that temperature,” Bikram said. Visibility and wind speeds are among the main challenges. It took a month for them to learn the terrain.\n\nAirlift Nepal’s first clean-up drive used a drone to bring down about 1100 pounds of trash from Camp One to Base Camp.\n\nThat took more than 40 flights: The drone can carry about 66 pounds of weight, but they only transport about 44 pounds at a time to be safe.\n\nFor the 2025 Everest climbing season, Pandey says that Airlift Technology will help Sherpas transport equipment before the season starts, then pick up trash once it begins.\n\nThe Sherpas tell Pandey which direction they need to go, then Pandey flies a small drone first to navigate the trail. Then, the Sherpas do what they’ve always done — climb to the precarious icefalls, or the parts of a glacier that are the hardest to navigate.\n\n“Once they find out ‘here we need a ladder,’ ‘here we need a rope,’ they will send us the coordinates via walkie-talkie and then we fly the equipment there,” Pandey explained. The drones are also able to fly in life-saving equipment like oxygen cylinders and medicines.\n\nAirlift currently has two DJI drones, only one of which is being operated on Everest this year. The second one is a backup, and if there’s need for more drone flights, they’ll consider deploying both.\n\nOne challenge is money. Each drone costs $70,000, and that’s before they even begin operating.\n\n“Everything is expensive at Base Camp,” Bikram said.\n\n“Because there’s no electricity we need a lot of fuel to charge batteries. The cost of actually getting to the camp, the manpower cost, accommodation, food, there’s a lot.”\n\nFor Bikram, an aeronautical engineer, drones have always been a passion. He made a “DIY Drone” in Nepal over a decade ago at a time when they were almost nonexistent in the country. This proved vital in assisting aid efforts during the 2015 Nepal earthquake.\n\n“It’s not just that we are providing equipment. Search and rescue is one of our main priorities. When people veer off the trail we can help geolocate them,” Pandey added.\n\nSome in the Sherpa community are turning away from working in the perilous high mountains and instead are moving abroad for better jobs and pay.\n\n“We hope that our drones will actually make this a safer profession and bring more people back to this climbing tradition. It’s what our country is known for, and without the expertise of the Sherpas we would never be able to navigate this terrain,” Pandey said.\n\n28-year-old Dawa Janzu Sherpa has been a “frontman” on Everest with the icefall doctors for eight years. The team of Sherpas is led by an elder who has developed his expertise in navigation and decides the trail, but it is the frontman with his might and youth who goes to the icefall first.\n\n“This season there is a lot of dry ice which makes it very hard to fix trails, and there are a lot of ice towers in between,” he said. While drones can now be used to determine a tentative path before they set out, inclement weather means that things are constantly changing.\n\nJanzu Sherpa says this is a risky job, and with employment hard to come by, for him, this work has been more about the paycheck than the passion. Drones have been reducing time and risk level by half.\n\n“Our work is time sensitive. If we don’t fix the trails quickly upcoming expeditions will be slowed down, so having the drones bring the equipment up means that we don’t have to go back down just to bring the ladder up with us.”\n\n“With the bad weather we’ve seen so far this year we would not have fixed the trail in time if not for that help,” he added.\n\nJanzu Sherpa is the sole breadwinner for his wife and two daughters. “This is an adventurous job and there is a lot of risk, so if there’s a way to make it safer I welcome it.”\n\nThe first group of climbers have reached Base Camp for the 2025 climbing season. It’s a narrow season, so almost everyone will attempt their ascents in April and May.\n\nDrone use “is part of the evolution of climbing,” says Caroline Ogle of New Zealand-based Adventure Consultants, who has spent five seasons at Base Camp managing expeditions from what she refers to as “the amphitheater of Everest.”\n\n“If you compare back to the early years … when there were no satellite phones or the kind of weather forecasting we have available now, all those types of technology have evolved to make climbing safer. I feel the use of drones is part of that natural evolution, particularly in the context of making things safer for the high altitude workers (Sherpas),” Ogle said.\n\nLisa Thompson, who has climbed the seven summits — the highest peak on all seven of the traditional continents — and now trains climbers through US based Alpine Athletics, agrees with Ogle and sees drones as a “welcome and responsible evolution.”\n\n“I don’t believe this innovation takes away from the craft or tradition of climbing. The mountain is still the mountain. The challenge is still real.”', 'Scaling up', 'Updated 9:53 PM EDT, Mon April 21, 2025', 'drones-can-deliver-supplies-on-mount-everest-this-year-and-it-may-change-climbing-forever-1745808910'),

These airlines are keeping them alive', 'https://edition.cnn.com/travel/airbus-a380-boeing-747-still-flying/index.html', 'Chris Dong', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-1986207676.jpg?q=w_2000,c_fill', 'An Airbus A380 superjumbo — the world\'s largest passenger plane — dwarfs a smaller jet on the ground at New York\'s John F. Kennedy International Airport.', 'They’re massive pieces of engineering that seem to defy physics as they hang in the air during takeoff and landing, but double-decker passenger airplanes — the Boeing 747 and Airbus A380 — are still some of the most popular aircraft around.\n\nPerhaps it’s their whisper-quiet cabins and spacious designs. Or the availability of opulent amenities, like shower suites and onboard bars. For aviation enthusiasts, there’s the added novelty of flying on a plane’s upper deck or nose.\n\nHowever, it’s a matter of when — not if — these planes will be retired once and for all. Over a half-century ago, the 747, the original jumbo jet, ushered in a glamorous jet age, helping bring affordable air travel to the world. But in today’s era, the double-deckers are too big and too expensive for most airlines.\n\nThankfully, travelers can experience these aircraft for at least another decade. Today, 11 airlines around the world fly two-level passenger planes. To stay competitive, several carriers are even investing in them with updated seats and refreshed onboard amenities.\n\nDouble-decker planes aren’t produced anymore, with Boeing ending 747 production in 2022 and Airbus calling it quits on the A380 — the world’s biggest passenger plane — in 2021. Therefore, their lifespan is reliant on what is already in airlines’ fleets.\n\nThe pandemic accelerated the double-decker’s demise, with carriers like Air France permanently grounding its 10 superjumbo A380s. “The problem with the A380 is not necessarily its size, but its lack of efficiency,” says Brian Sumers, an aviation expert and founder of The Airline Observer.\n\n“Boeing understood sooner than Airbus that the future would be about fuel-efficient single-deck jets with two engines. Now, of course, they both know it.”\n\nHowever, continued delays and global supply constraints mean the two companies are unable to deliver new aircraft fast enough to meet demand. This, along with continued demand for premium travel, means the A380 and 747 are soldiering on.\n\nQantas and Etihad, for instance, earmarked the A380 for retirement, only to bring their planes back from the brink of extinction over the last few years.\n\nGlobal Airlines, a British startup, is a peculiarity, having acquired a double-decker aircraft on the second-hand market, with three additional ones planned. The carrier aims to offer transatlantic flights starting this year with a single 16-year-old A380, but its economic proposition is questionable.\n\n“The airline business is tough under any circumstances. It becomes nearly impossible if you’re running a tiny fleet of inefficient aircraft,” says Sumers.\n\nFinally, there’s one more twist: one could argue that the final Boeing 747 has yet to enter service. Two new Boeing 747-8s are currently being modified, not without controversy, to become the United States Air Force One presidential aircraft. They’re expected to start flying in 2029.\n\nHere’s a closer look at the airlines that fly a double-decker passenger jet — including the ones that offer the best onboard experiences (yes, we’re talking bars, lounges, suites and more).\n\nAir China is only one of three carriers that still operate the Boeing 747 (Lufthansa and Korean Air are the others). The airline has a total of nine Boeing 747s in its fleet — two 747-400s and seven 747-8s.\n\nThere are no imminent plans for its Queens of the Skies to be retired.\n\nIn 2020, Japan’s largest carrier, ANA, became the last new customer for the Airbus A380. The airline has three A380 aircraft, which exclusively fly between Tokyo and Honolulu.\n\nPassengers can expect modern first and business-class cabins alongside a unique Hawaiian-themed livery called “Flying Honu.” There’s plenty of time to fly on these planes — the oldest ANA A380 has only been flying for six years.\n\nKorean carrier Asiana has a fleet of six A380s, and it’s not yet clear when they’ll be retired. On the upper deck of the A380 is a lounge area with banquette-style seating, which business class passengers can use.\n\nThe carrier is set to merge with Korean Air over the next couple of years.\n\nIn late 2021, the airline brought back the A380, and all signs point toward the superjumbo staying in the British Airways fleet for years to come.\n\nLater in 2025, the carrier plans to begin refurbishing its 12 A380s with an all-new first-class suite, bringing new life to the jet.\n\nThe Dubai-based carrier operates the most A380s of any airline, with 116 of the double-deckers in its fleet. They’ve got more than a decade left of flying.\n\n“Emirates is really the only airline to have cracked the code with the A380,” says Sumers. “They’ve done a nice job telling people about the passenger comfort benefits of the giant plane.”\n\nThe most lauded aspect of the Emirates A380? Ultra-luxurious private suites and a shower spa in first class, and an onboard bar and lounge in business class. Beyond first and business, the airline is in the process of equipping 67 of its A380 aircraft with a premium economy cabin as part of a massive billion-dollar retrofit. It’s the first of the major Middle Eastern carriers to offer this class of service.\n\nIn 2023, Etihad brought back its 486-seat A380 from the brink of retirement. It currently has six A380s, with a seventh reentering service later this year. The carrier is famous for its swanky, three-room suite in the sky called The Residence. This 125-square-foot space is the closest thing to flying on a private jet and comes with its own living room, bedroom and private bathroom.\n\nEtihad also has nine first-class seats, each with a separate bed and recliner, along with an onboard bar and shower spa. Current A380 routes include New York, London, Paris and Singapore (with Toronto replacing New York in August 2025).\n\nThe Seoul-based carrier operates both the 747 and A380 — but travelers should opt for the former if given the chance. That’s because the cabins on the 747 are more modern, and every business class seat has direct aisle access (unlike aboard the A380).\n\n“Some of our customers intentionally choose us to fly on a double-decker aircraft,” says David Pacey, executive vice president of inflight services and lounges at Korean. While both the 747 and A380 were set to be retired by 2025, delays in new aircraft delivery mean they’ll continue to fly for at least several more years.\n\nIn March, the airline unveiled an all-new onboard experience, including updated premium cabin menus and blankets and loungewear by Frette. Korean also has some of the best economy legroom of any airline, with an average seat “pitch” (distance between seats) of 33-34 inches.\n\nGerman flag carrier Lufthansa is the largest operator of the 747, and there’s plenty of life left in these planes. In the coming months, the 747-8 variant will start to be refurbished with new first-class suites, Allegris business and a modern premium economy. (The new business product will be installed initially, then first class later.)\n\nMeanwhile, eight of Lufthansa’s A380s have returned to service, with two more planned. These jets were brought back due to ongoing delays with the delivery of the Boeing 777-9. Starting next year, the A380 will also get a new business class, a massive upgrade from the dated 2-2-2 layout that’s currently flying.\n\nOver the last several years, Australian flag carrier Qantas has undergone a massive refurbishment of its A380 aircraft. That includes more premium seats — 70 updated business suites, an extended premium economy section with 60 seats, as well as a refreshed first class and an inflight lounge.\n\n“The Airbus A380 has been a consistent favorite for our Qantas customers ever since the aircraft took to the skies in 2008,” says Cam Wallace, the airline’s CEO. Wallace says to expect the double-decker to remain flying until 2032, when it’ll be replaced by the Airbus A350.\n\nQantas currently has eight A380s in operation, with two additional aircraft slated to rejoin the fleet in 2025. One of those planes will fly the Dallas to Sydney route beginning in August.\n\nThe Doha-based carrier has a fleet of eight A380s, and they’ll be flying for years to come.\n\nWhile the A380 doesn’t have Qatar’s newest business-class product called the Qsuite, it does have an onboard bar and lounge as well as an eight-seat first-class cabin.\n\nSingapore flies 12 A380s, and they’re known for their opulent first-class product.\n\nThese hotel room-like suites offer more than 50 square feet of space, a reclining armchair, a separate bed (two suites can be combined to create a double bed) and sliding doors.\n\nThe airline has no imminent plans to retire the A380.', 'What the future holds', 'Updated 6:08 AM EDT, Fri April 18, 2025', 'doubledecker-passenger-planes-are-a-dying-breed-these-airlines-are-keeping-them-alive-1745808910');

Now Gen Z wants a different kind of fun', 'https://edition.cnn.com/travel/berlin-party-capital-europe-gen-z/index.html', 'Bryn Stole', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-1722203459.jpg?q=w_2000,c_fill', 'Berlin has long been considered Europe\'s nightlife capital. But the scene is shifting rapidly.', 'It’s 2 a.m. and hundreds of people are lined up outside Berlin’s legendary techno club Berghain. Forget the Philharmonic or the Neue Nationalgalerie — this is Berlin’s most famous cultural institution, and throngs of black-clad dance freaks are hoping to make it past the club’s notoriously selective bouncers.\n\nBut all’s not well in Berlin’s club scene. Wilde Renate, a funhouse of stacked dancefloors inside a shabby old apartment building just over a mile from Berghain, plans to shutter by the end of the year. Just across the river, the waterside dancefloors at Watergate have sat silent since a final farewell party over New Year’s, ending the club’s 22-year run as one of Europe’s most storied electronic music destinations.\n\nBerlin’s hedonistic, techno-tortured nightlife is deeply interwoven in the city’s cultural identity, and the string of venue closures prompted plenty of hand-wringing about the future amid rising rents, gentrification and shifting party dynamics. Naturally, there’s a German word for the phenomenon: Clubsterben, or club death.\n\n“The days when Berlin was flooded with club-loving visitors are over,” Watergate’s management wrote in an Instagram post last year announcing the decision to close, adding that a “change in the nightlife dynamics of the next club generation and a shift in the relevance of club culture in general” helped prompt the decision to shutter.\n\nAn entire younger generation that came of age during the coronavirus lockdowns, when most of Berlin’s clubs were shuttered, was never initiated into Berlin’s famed club culture, one of the club’s owners, Uli Wombacher, told the local Berliner Zeitung newspaper not long after the announcement. “The generational leaps in this business are quick. Two and a half years of closed clubs makes a difference.”\n\nThings have undoubtedly gotten tougher, as the wild and freewheeling Berlin underground that emerged after the fall of the Berlin Wall in the 1990s — when the collapse of communism and a prolonged economic slump meant sprawling abandoned industrial spaces and riverside warehouses made perfect spots for DIY raves — has given way to gentrification and an influx of big business.\n\nRents are up sharply, costs for energy, staffing and DJs have risen and the jetloads of young tourists who once packed Berlin’s clubs every weekend have fallen off, but if you know where to look, there are still few places on Earth that boast the kind of nightlife that continues to pulse through the German capital. Now, it’s a much more diverse cast of party organizers looking to remake (or perhaps just sustain) a club scene that first vaulted to global fame three decades ago — and to do it, they have to appeal to the younger generations.\n\nBut mainstream club culture in Berlin has also hit middle-aged respectability: The parents of Gen Z scenesters once danced at clubs like Berghain and Tresor in their own youth, and staid German politicians applauded last year as the country’s UNESCO commission added Berlin’s techno culture to its list of intangible cultural heritage — a designation also bestowed on things like Turkish bagpiping, European falconry or Inuit drum dancing.\n\nSo maybe it shouldn’t be much of a surprise that some of the kids want to shape a party scene of their own. Berlin clubs remain a welcoming destination for partiers and electronic music aficionados even well into middle age and beyond — but while younger clubbers still make up a good chunk of the crowd, their generation isn’t turning out in quite the same numbers.\n\nPart of that might reflect higher costs and healthier lifestyles. For instance, several recent studies have shown Gen Zers around the world are drinking less alcohol.\n\nBut younger revelers are also seeking out a looser, more relaxed and freewheeling scene driven by upbeat, bouncier playlists packed with trance and throwback pop. Over the past decade, Berlin has also become far more diverse, and an entire wave of newer collectives are throwing parties built around a broader array of music — from Afrobeat to Arab electronic — in addition to stalwart Berlin club staples like house, techno and hip hop.\n\n“Berlin’s clubbing scene started as counterculture, but now it’s so mainstream and less exciting,” said Jose, a 26-year-old student who grew up in Berlin, who did not want to reveal his full name for privacy reasons. “It’s also very expensive. Maybe that opened the space for other things to emerge. People are going to cultural events, to illegal raves, to more underground or lower-key events.”\n\nSome of Berlin’s most famous old-line clubs have long cultivated exclusive reputations, with hours-long waits outside and tough door policies that have prompted scores of online guides for how to worm your way inside (some suggest donning Berlin’s unofficial all-black club uniform).\n\nPerhaps none are as steeped in legend as Berghain, a towering techno temple in a former East Berlin power plant frequently mentioned as the best club in the world. There, the discerning (or capricious) judgment of the door staff has made the club’s heavily tattooed chief bouncer, Sven Marquardt, a minor celebrity in his own right.\n\nThe reverence for places like Berghain reflects just how seriously Berliners take their techno parties — but also grates on at least some partygoers who’ve been seeking out a more carefree atmosphere to just cut loose and relax, instead of stressing about making the cut.\n\n“We’re not looking for this super strict and serious type of going out, which is kind of what I feel like Berlin was to me a while ago,” said Daria, 24, who did not want to reveal her full name for privacy reasons. “When people go out to dance to techno, you’d have to be this specific type of person who takes everything very seriously, who has to stay up super late. It’s something that we’re not looking for anymore.\n\n“For me, clubbing is about spending time with people you like, being able to express yourself freely, being very careless,” she added. “And from what I’ve heard and seen, you can’t really be careless if you don’t know if you’re gonna get in, if you have to behave or look a certain way.”\n\nThe pandemic saw a surge of illegal open-air raves in parks and other open spaces around Berlin, usually in defiance of pandemic rules, and that scene helped fuel a resurgence in the underground party scene. The kinds of empty spaces that fueled the club scene’s rise in the 1990s are mostly long gone from central Berlin, but there are now plenty of raves — some legally permitted, many not — hosted in fields along highways and in abandoned industrial spaces on the far outskirts of the city.\n\nAll that’s really needed for a good party, at its core, is a bit of electricity, a halfway decent sound system, a keen crowd — and perhaps a few crates of cheap pilsner.\n\nSome of the more established clubs have also been changing sharply. Suicide Circus, for example, has been around in Berlin in one form or another for more than three decades and has been in a location in a former factory complex near the railway tracks in the heart of former East Berlin since 2009. But in early 2024, the club rechristened itself Lokschuppen (meaning “locomotive shed”) and turned over some of the parties to new event collectives, who brought with them a younger crowd.\n\n“I remember times when people went there just for the club,” one of the club’s managers, Jermaine Fuchs, told the Tagesspiegel newspaper. “Today, guests tend to travel after DJs or collectives.”\n\nEmiko Gejic, spokesperson for the Berlin Club Commission, a group that advocates for Berlin’s club scene, said a whole wave of younger music and events collectives have been bringing “a different style” to Berlin’s club scene and broadening the kinds of offerings in clubs.\n\n“They often host more of a community space. There’s a lot of young collectives — POC collectives, queer-based collectives, FLINTA (female, lesbian, intersex, non-binary, transgender and agender) collectives — that are much more about identity and creating safer spaces,” she said.\n\n“They often host events that have a much more diverse programming with film screenings, with panel talks, with concerts, with live performances. It becomes definitely much more artsy in some way, rather than, let’s say, just a rave where people just go to dance in a dark room with loud techno music.”\n\nAziz Sarr, 44, grew up around the nightlife scene in Berlin. His father, a DJ originally from Senegal, regularly performed at Dschungel, a renowned hotspot in 1980s West Berlin. He started organizing and DJing his own parties more than a decade ago with a pair of collectives, Freak d’Afrique and RISE, both focused on some of the hottest music coming out of Africa. Along with Ukai Ndame, he opened MAAYA last year in a space next door to Lokschuppen.\n\n“Berlin has become much more diverse, you can see that,” he said. “And all these communities, they want to party, and so of course they shape the nightlife.\n\n“Berlin is definitely one of those cities where you can go out to any kind of music,” said Sarr. “You can go out to an Afropop party, a techno party, a Brazilian party, an Arab electro party, an Arab queer party. I think there’s a party for any scene in Berlin — I think that’s really beautiful and it’s getting more and more diverse.”\n\nZuher Jazmati started throwing what he calls Arabic queer events with the collective ADIRA in February 2023. He learned to love Berlin’s raucous nightlife scene growing up in the city in the 2000s, and while he complains that a more commercial, mainstream type of clubbing has crowded out some of the counterculture, there’s also been growing space for events beyond thumping raves. ADIRA throws pop parties that pack clubs, but also community events, art shows and book launches.\n\n“A party like ours would not have happened in any of the clubs that you had in Berlin,” he said. “I mean, an Arabic queer pop music party? Where?”\n\nRising costs have undeniably made it harder for the party scene to thrive, and a higher cost of living in Berlin — which once stood out among major European cities for its relatively cheap rents, which attracted artists and leisure-seeking party types — has put the damper on the party scene. Entry fees that used to hover around 10 to 15 euros ($11 to $17) not long ago have shot upward to 20 or even 30 euros. “A ton of my friends would be down to go out, but they’re just not really able to spend 40 euros,” said Daria.\n\n“It’s becoming a luxurious thing to go out to buy drinks, to consume drugs. That all costs a lot of money,” added Jazmati, 35.\n\n“Maybe some nepo babies, or some upper-class kids, but it’s not something that’s so easy to do as a working-class kid.”\n\nHe’s also noticed that the younger crowd doesn’t go out as much, partly after missing out on the ability to let loose at parties during the pandemic in their formative years. But the expense of nights out at established clubs has also driven a younger revival of some underground parties, and Jazmati said he’s hopeful that Berlin will find places — perhaps on the outskirts, in unfashionable neighborhoods or different kinds of spaces — to keep the subculture alive.\n\n“Berlin’s nightlife scene was a subculture that was accessible, that was always for the weirdos, for the ones who never fit into society, who really wanted to have room to escape a little bit,” he said. “This is what makes Berlin fascinating and interesting.”\n\n“For a long time in Berlin culture, clubbing was always extremely accessible for young people, for people’s low income, and that has changed a lot,” Gejic said.\n\nBut if there’s also been one constant about Berlin’s nightlife scene over the decades, it’s an older generation telling new arrivals that they’d missed out on all the best parties. “When I got here people already said it’s dead,” DJ, producer and Berlin club veteran Sven von Thülen recently told the city’s English-language magazine, The Berliner, about the club scene in 1996.\n\n“I think the best times are over but I’m not sure where it’s still better, I’ll say it that way,” said Daria. “I mean just quantity-wise, and of the diversity of parties and clubs and people, I think Berlin is still top-notch.”', 'Middle-aged respectability', 'Updated 5:03 AM EDT, Mon April 21, 2025', 'it-was-the-hedonistic-party-capital-of-europe-now-gen-z-wants-a-different-kind-of-fun-1745808910'),

Families heading outdoors during spring break are arriving by the carload to enjoy hiking, admire wildlife, learn about history and nature and enjoy all that the National Park system offers. When they arrive with their tents, hiking poles and sunscreen, they might also need to pack their patience and come extra-prepared.\n\nThe Trump administration’s January hiring freeze, February mass firings of 1,000 national park personnel and buy-out and early retirement package offers for National Park Service staffers have caused uncertainty for park workers and visitors alike. Though the hiring freeze was lifted, and a federal judge ruled the workers were unlawfully terminated and ordered they be offered their jobs back, the chaos has caused a ripple effect that means staffing issues continue and may affect park services across the country.\n\nCurrent and former park rangers are concerned that, in addition to congestion in the parks, uneven staffing could mean rushing through important visitor education related to safety, dangerous waits for emergency support when a visitor is injured and inadequate training in essential functions such as firefighting.\n\n“National parks in the Southwest are already busy,” says Cassidy Jones, senior visitation program manager for the National Parks Conservation Association, a century-old nonprofit formed to watch over the parks. “Seasonal hiring was extremely delayed and, therefore, many seasonal employees aren’t even on the job yet. That means you have reduced staff all over these parks that are already busy.”\n\nAfter the government lifted the prohibition on hiring seasonal employees, US officials authorized hiring a higher number of seasonal employees than last year.\n\n“The thing that I don’t think anyone knows yet is how that will play out,” says Dan Wenk, who worked for the National Park Service for decades before retiring in 2018.\n\n“A lot of offers had already been extended and then had to be revoked. Many of those people were very high-quality employees who had been returning year after year and were very good at their jobs,” said Wenk. “The question is, are they going to be available now? Did they take other opportunities when they thought they weren’t going to have a job?”\n\nRick Mossman, president of the board of the Association of National Park Rangers (ANPR), estimates that about a quarter of NPS personnel has been lost to recent buyout and early retirement offers.\n\nIn a statement, the National Park Service said it is committed to providing “seamless” access to national park sites.\n\n“NPS is working closely with the Office of Personnel Management to ensure we are prioritizing fiscal responsibility for the American people. As always, NPS will continue to provide critical services and deliver excellent customer service,” the park service said.\n\nWenk explains the risks that understaffing presents to both people and parks. “Every forest fire, every summer, takes people away from their duty station … but that’s going to affect the level of service and protection that you have.”\n\nSome rangers are trained in fire management, working in conjunction with the US Forest Service and local governments to manage and extinguish fires when necessary.\n\n“If you don’t have those long-term seasonals who are trained in firefighting, or those probationary employees who chose not to come back, or permanent employees who may have taken one of the buyouts, well, I think this is going to be kind of a hold-your-breath year,” Wenk said.\n\nWenk began working with the National Park Service in 1973, serving in various roles, including as the deputy director for operations of the National Park Service and superintendent at both Mount Rushmore National Memorial and Yellowstone National Park.\n\nAccording to Wenk and NPS figures posted on the Yellowstone site, the park has slightly fewer rangers than in 2018 when Wenk retired, yet attendance has increased by over 600,000 people since then.\n\nRangers protect both the resources and visitors. Even at full staffing, Wenk felt Yellowstone in 2018 was understaffed “to make sure people were staying on boardwalks in thermal areas and keeping the proper distance away from animals. Any reduction in [ranger staff] is going to mean that there are fewer rangers out there to make sure people are staying safe, whether in relation to resources or animals. Pick your peril.”\n\nMossman has a more dire warning.\n\n“If they try to keep the parks fully opened with little staff this summer, visitors will die due to no or slow response to medical emergencies and incidents,” he said.\n\nBasic visitor services are also likely to be impacted.\n\nThis year, fewer gates might be open, which means longer lines to enter, so visitors should plan to arrive early and be prepared to wait. To speed up those lines, some parks only accept credit cards for entrance fees.\n\nRangers staffing the gates don’t simply take the admission fees and send visitors on their way. They orient visitors to the park and share information about weather conditions, trail closures and park shuttles, among other things.\n\n“With current staffing, we will have days where we will process 300 vehicles in an hour, meaning our average time per group is less than a minute to greet, check or sell passes and orient,” according to one ranger in a high-traffic East Coast park, who requested anonymity out of concern for political targeting. Once inside the park, many visitors’ first stop is the visitor center.\n\n“There’s fewer folks to staff visitor centers so we see reduced hours at visitor centers and maybe full days that a visitor center is not open,” says Jones, of the National Parks Conservation Association.\n\nYet on April 3, Interior Secretary Doug Burgum issued an order for parks to “remain open and accessible,” saying officials will ensure proper staffing to do so. How that staffing will be achieved is unclear.\n\n“The secretary did tell the NPS to make sure everything will be open,” said ANPR’s Mossman. “This is impossible.” He said that 2024 staffing is lower than it was in 1980, when there were at least 100 fewer NPS sites and about a third of the number of total visitors.\n\nTo make sure visitors are well-prepared, Rachel Pawlitz, public affairs chief for the National Park Service, recommends that they “research the park they’re looking to visit, understand what passes or reservations are needed, create a backup plan in case things don’t go as planned.”\n\nPawlitz recommends downloading the NPS App to easily access park information and maps while in the park, and checking park websites in advance for the latest information related to changes in services, hours of operation, inclement weather or safety notices.\n\nLong-time seasonal and non-seasonal employees train newer staff, several sources said. Assuming some found other roles after they were fired, and others accepted early retirement, there will not only be shorter training periods, but that training will most likely be provided by those with less experience.\n\nIn addition to their duties in education and information, law enforcement and fire management, some rangers work as park scientists.\n\n“I know of archaeologists and wildlife biologists who were fired in the probationary cuts on Valentine’s Day,” Jones explains. “These are skilled, very qualified people who are behind the scenes all the time to make sure these park resources stay protected in perpetuity. So, there’s a lot of long-standing projects — research, monitoring endangered species and understanding if invasive grasses are making their way into the park — that are just completely on pause.”\n\nDuring the 2019 government shutdown, parks were ordered to remain open. Without the staff to patrol them, many had issues with overflowing sewage from pit toilets, full trash bins and vandalism. Food waste was found around parks, which encourages wildlife to look to human sources for food.\n\nIf a bear enters a campground or approaches humans more than once looking for food, they’re known as a second offender, now trained that humans supply the food. In these cases, the bear faces euthanasia.\n\nWenk recommends visitors bring a bag or two with them to carry out not only their own trash, but any trash they may see lying around.\n\n“One of the biggest things I worry about, because there’s damage every year to resources with the national parks,” explains Wenk, “is not having the resource protection capability. Parks are about perpetuity, and taking care of them into perpetuity. And we just have to make sure that we’re doing that to the highest level.”\n\nHe explains that long entrance lines or some canceled ranger programs are short-term issues.\n\n“Making sure you protect the park is the long-term issue that every person who works for the Park Service is entrusted [with],” he said.\n\nThe NPS manages 433 individual units, which include 63 National Parks and 87 National Monuments among other categories such as seashores, lakeshores, historic sites and more.\n\nThis year, Wenk recommends, “Maybe look for those areas that are not the Yosemites, the Glaciers, the Yellowstones, the iconic national parks, but look for some of those lesser-appreciated and used ones. They’re great parks. They’re parks that tell America’s story, whether it’s our natural history or our cultural history.\n\n“If this is your one chance to go to that iconic park you’ve wanted to all your life, be sure you’re as well informed before you get to that gate as you can be.”', '“A hold-your-breath year”', 'Updated 8:00 AM EDT, Wed April 16, 2025', 'national-parks-brace-for-a-holdyourbreath-year-as-the-season-heats-up-1745808911'),

It’s got murder. Sexy scandals. Gorgeous beaches. And, perhaps most importantly, wealthy travelers behaving terribly.\n\nSeasons one and two of the satirical dark comedy-drama, written and directed by Mike White, were set in luxury hotels in two stunning places — Hawaii and Sicily, respectively.\n\nIn both seasons, guests and employees experience a transformative week as the truths behind the characters’ seemingly idyllic lives are exposed.\n\nThe third season of the Emmy-winning HBO show, now streaming on Max, takes viewers to another one of the world’s most popular destinations — Thailand.\n\nThe cast includes Carrie Coon, Michelle Monaghan, Jason Isaacs, Leslie Bibb, Walton Goggins, Parker Posey, Patrick Schwarzenegger and Thailand’s very own K-pop superstar, Lalisa ‘Lisa’ Manobal. Season one fan favorite Natasha Rothwell also returns to reprise her role as spa employee Belinda.\n\nBut the stunning landscapes of Koh Samui, where most of the action takes place, and other popular destinations like Bangkok and Phuket also play starring roles.\n\nThankfully, HBO has released a list highlighting many of the locations that were used to create the irresistible backdrop of season three, allowing travelers to create their own White Lotus-inspired journey.\n\nAs Lalisa’s character “Mook” says, “I hope you enjoy Thailand.” Minor spoilers ahead!\n\nKoh Samui, located in the Gulf of Thailand, is the country’s second-biggest island after Phuket. Its white sandy shores are dotted with luxury hotels, a handful of which make an appearance in the show.\n\nKeeping with tradition, the Four Seasons Resort Koh Samui is the real star of season three, standing in for the title character — the White Lotus Resort & Spa. (Both seasons one and two were filmed in Four Seasons properties.)\n\nMany scenes take place in the resort’s luxurious pool villas, as well as at the main swimming pool, common areas, paths and fitness areas. And that includes the gorgeous Ratliff family villa, where matriarch Victoria (Parker Posey) recites some of her most iconic lines. (No word on whether the villa comes with its own blender or if it needs to be requested.)\n\nAll of the breakfast and lunch restaurant scenes were shot in the Four Seasons resort as well.\n\nThe “White Lotus” bar, however, can actually be found at another luxury property — it’s Anantara Lawana Koh Samui Resort’s Singing Bird Lounge. (The dinner restaurant is actually in Phuket, more on that below.)\n\nAs for the hotel’s security station and driveway, where many scenes featuring security guard Gaitok (Tayme Thapthimthong) took place? You’ll have to head for the Thai hotel brand’s second resort on the island, Anantara Bophut Koh Samui. The jewelry store scenes were shot there too.\n\nAnd of course we can’t forget the Buddhist monastery that brought the Ratliff family to Koh Samui in the first place. Those scenes were shot at Wat Phu Khao Thong, near Maenam Beach.\n\nMeanwhile, in a humorous scene in episode four, the three ladies traveling together get to experience their first Songkran festival.

During one of the most talked about TV monologues of the year, Frank makes some wild confessions about how he’s been spending his time in Thailand.\n\nThat scene was shot inside the Bamboo Bar inside Bangkok’s historic Mandarin Oriental Hotel.\n\nThe pair eventually heads to confront American expat Jim Hollinger (Scott Glenn), whom Rick believes wronged his family, at the grand riverside home he shares with his wife, White Lotus owner Sritala. Travelers can actually stay in that property too — it’s the Siri Sala Private Thai Villa, located on the Bangkok Noi Canal. Guests need to book the entire home, which has six bedrooms.\n\nNext, Rick and Frank hit the town. Those night club scenes were shot inside Bangkok’s Sing Sing Theater on Sukhumvit Road.\n\nThe pair then make their way back to the Mandarin Oriental and head through the iconic lobby to head up to the real-life 376-square-meter, two-bedroom Oriental Suite where they keep the party going.\n\nEver since it was confirmed in early 2024 that the third season would be set in Thailand, much has been said about the inevitable impact the show will have on tourism growth.\n\n“We are honored to have amazing Thailand featured as the filming location for the highly anticipated upcoming season of ‘The White Lotus,’” said Tourism Authority of Thailand Governor Thapanee Kiatphaibool in a press release following the announcement.\n\n“The kingdom’s exotic natural beauty, rich historical sites and diverse landscapes are the perfect settings to share our fascinating culture, fantastic cuisine, top-notch wellness and luxury offerings, and most importantly our people and Thai hospitality.”\n\nMultiple tour companies and resorts have put together “White Lotus” themed Thailand packages, including those featured on the show.\n\nMeanwhile, the Tourism Authority of Thailand reports the country welcomed more than 35 million international travelers in 2024, generating over 1.8 trillion baht ($53.5 billion) in tourism revenue. This year, it aims to attract 39-40 million international visitors and generate 3 trillion baht in tourism revenue, which would mark a return to pre-pandemic arrival numbers.\n\n“The White Lotus” Season 3 is available to stream on Max.

A few original structures remain.', 'This week in travel news: the original “motor hotel” sits abandoned, the world’s busiest airports are ranked, and how to move abroad without messing it up.\n\nHotels and guesthouses have existed for centuries. But the motel was born in 1925 when an architect named Arthur Heineman came up with the idea for a “motor hotel,” shortened to “motel.”\n\nThe concept was simple but effective: Now that more and more people had cars and were going on road trips, they needed places where they could stop and stay the night along the way. Thus Heineman paired low-cost rooms with small garages where guests could safely park their cars — all for $1.25 a night.\n\nThe Milestone Mo-Tel was located in San Luis Obispo, California, which CNN Travel named one of the best towns to visit in America last year. It’s located midway between Los Angeles and San Francisco, and rooms at the motel had modern-for-the-time conveniences like hot showers and indoor carpeting. The design was inspired by the nearby Spanish mission.\n\nThe original Milestone Mo-Tel, later called the Motel Inn, closed in 1991 and has been abandoned, but Heineman’s idea still lives on 100 years later.\n\nAhead of the big summer travel season, Airports Council International (ACI) World released its annual roundup of the world’s busiest airports based on the number of people served.\n\nAtlanta’s Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport has been in the No. 1 spot for 26 of the last 27 years, with 2020 (when the pandemic threw the travel industry for a loop) being the only exception.\n\nDallas, Denver, Dubai and Delhi also landed in the top 10. Check out the full list for more.\n\nBut flying is about more than just lists and rankings. Australian airline Qantas is bringing back a version of its famous “Kangaroo route,” which traveled from Sydney to London with some fun layovers along the way.\n\nThe new itinerary lasts 14 days, with stops in Darwin, Singapore, Kolkata, Colombo, Cairo, Toulouse and Rome. It includes all meals, hotels, transfers and tours, which include perks like a private walkthrough at the Vatican Museums. The cost? A cool 49,950 Australian dollars (about $32,000) per person.\n\nSouvenirs can remind us of previous trips and help re-create the inspiring feeling of seeing the Great Wall of China or the Eiffel Tower for the first time. Besides being cute, some souvenirs have deep meaning.\n\nIn Japan, one of the most popular gifts is a Daruma. These round red dolls are ubiquitous at temples around the country, but they actually serve a very special purpose: People who buy Darumas are supposed to set a goal for themselves, paint one of the doll’s eyes, and then only fill in the second when the goal is achieved.\n\nOver in the United States, an unexpected place has become a souvenir hot spot: the Trader Joe’s grocery store chain.\n\nAlthough shoppers can get the usual fresh produce, the brand known as TJ’s has become “the Disneyland of American grocery stores,” with travelers from around the world heading here for branded tote bags and Instagrammable treats.\n\nOne of the most popular products is the “everything but the bagel” seasoning blend, but be careful — South Korea has banned the item because of the presence of poppy seeds.\n\nOverdid it while shopping on vacation and worried you won’t be able to fit all your purchases in your suitcase? Our friends at CNN Underscored, a product reviews and recommendations guide owned by CNN, have rounded up the best luggage organizers.\n\nWhen California resident Keith Richardson started thinking about where he wanted to move, he had some interesting requirements — his new home had to be near the sea and not near a Starbucks or McDonald’s.\n\nRichardson found his dream house in the small town of Nardò, Italy, where he plans to spend as much time as possible post-retirement.\n\nHe’s one of many Americans who are considering relocating to Europe for a different kind of life. If the whole process seems overwhelming, these relocation experts have some advice for you.\n\nUNESCO’s latest Global Geopark is in … North Korea.\n\nMount Paektu is where Kim Jong Il said he was born.\n\nThe White Lotus season 3 is over.\n\nBut you can still visit all the filming locations in Thailand.\n\nTwo strangers met at the Eiffel Tower and fell in love.\n\nNo, not a romcom — this is real life.\n\nTuvalu is one of the world’s least-visited countries.\n\nAnd as of last week it has its first ATMs.', 'Birth of the motel', 'Published 11:00 AM EDT, Sat April 19, 2025', 'the-worlds-first-motel-opened-100-years-ago-but-now-only-ruins-remain-1745808911'),
(340, 'He moved from California to rural Italy because he ‘didn’t want to be anywhere near a McDonald’s or Starbucks’', 'https://edition.cnn.com/travel/relocation-california-rural-italy-nardo/index.html', 'Silvia Marchetti', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/img-9300-20250411183059836.jpg?q=w_2000,c_fill', 'American Keith Richardson paid $111,000 for a house in the pretty southern Italian town of Nardò.', 'A bargain-price home in a beautiful town — with a cleaner and a handyman thrown in for good measure — would be enough of a deal for many people to make the leap to Italy, but American Keith Richardson had one other key requirement.\n\nThe property where he intended to start his new life must not be anywhere near a McDonald’s or Starbucks, for him two symbols of the commercialized world he was trying to escape in the US.\n\nOnce he’d decided on Puglia, the mainly rural region that stretches down into the heel of Italy’s boot, after viewing online properties, an expat friend introduced him to an American real estate consultant living in the area, who directed him toward Nardò, a quiet town just inland from the coast.\n\n“I gave her a list of homes I like,” Richardson, who used to work in the US education system, told CNN. “She suggested including Nardò because I told her that I didn’t want to be anywhere near a McDonald’s or Starbucks.”\n\nAnd, after some shrewd low-ball bidding, he secured the property he hopes to spend the rest of his retirement in for barely one-tenth of the cost of a similarly situated property back home in Southern California.\n\n“The house was listed for 138,000 euros ($153,000) but I negotiated and paid €100,000 ($111,000). I put in another 3,800 euros to restyle it to my liking and give it a fresh look,” he tells CNN.\n\n“It was a very pleasant surprise. I was willing to pay more, but started at 100,000 euros to see if the sellers would counter offer.”\n\nThey did not.\n\nThe 667-square-foot house (62 square meters) he bought is a two-bed, two-bath home on the ground floor of what was originally storage or dwellings for the servants working in Palazzo Tafuri, one of Nardò’s landmarks.\n\nThe dwelling is made with Puglia’s typical pinkish-golden stone blocks. It came with a fireplace, three stellar ceilings, limestone walls, and had been completely renovated by the original owners.\n\nRichardson’s only major addition was a permanent roof over the patio, and strong, long-lasting bamboo privacy screens. A very small price to pay, he says, considering the value for money the house represents.\n\n“Homes in Southern California within three miles from the coast, in such a desired area, would cost anywhere from $700,000 to $1.4 million,” he says.\n\nNardò is off the beaten track, far from the crowds and unknown even to many Italians. Located at the heart of Puglia’s pristine Salento area, it’s close to “Italy’s Maldives,” some of the country’s best tropical-style beaches. Richardson says it’s the perfect spot to soak up seaside vibes while enjoying a less hectic, carefree life.\n\n“Puglia is definitely the place to live and invest in, if you’re searching for that dolce vita coastal lifestyle,” he says.\n\n“I’ve fallen in love with the Italian lifestyle and domani (tomorrow) attitude. No need to worry because there is always domani. No worries, it will be taken care of domani, so for now, let’s just have a coffee and watch the people promenade by.”\n\nOther plus points were the affordability and lower cost of living compared to the US, the fresh chemical-free produce on sale in local shops, and the gorgeous coastlines and olive groves.\n\n“It’s reminiscent of Southern California in the 1960s,” Richardson adds. “I remember as a child passing through orange groves to get to Disneyland, Riverside, Santa Barbara.”\n\nHe says his love for Italy originally stemmed from his passion for learning languages — he taught Spanish for several years at university before working in administration.\n\nRichardson retired as director of research and curriculum for a high school district in the Los Angeles suburbs in 2015 and then later began to travel to Italy twice a year, exploring by rental car with friends and falling in love with the country’s lifestyle and what he calls the “candidness” of locals.\n\nBy 2023, he was home-hunting and narrowed his search down to Puglia, eventually choosing Nardò for its non-touristy appeal — and its absence of US fast food chains.\n\nHe says he wanted a place where everything was authentic and “local,” with nothing linked to mass tourism or major brands. Puglia was the obvious answer: “Beautiful beaches and coastlines, picturesque cities and towns, great weather (even in winter), and not full of the tourists that are found throughout Tuscany, Venice, Milan and Rome. In fact, most tourists tended to be Italians or other Europeans. The Dolce Vita was genuine.”\n\nAfter almost a year of looking around, in March 2024 he flew over from Orange County and in just a few days bought the house of his dreams in Nardò’s historical center, surrounded by majestic churches and lavishly decorated palazzos.\n\nPart of the property’s attraction was its proximity to the main Piazza Salandra, lined with café terraces. Another plus was that it was located on the ground floor with a patio, without any stairs — older properties in Italy’s historic centers are often spread over multiple floors, with steep, narrow staircases that are difficult to navigate with shopping or other items.\n\nRichardson currently comes and goes between South California and Nardò, but plans, once he gets his visa, to spend more time in Italy, though not on a permanent basis at first. “My parents are currently still living and I do so much want to spend several months out of the year near them” in the US, he adds.\n\nHe plans to apply for an elective residence visa in May 2025, which is based on a minimum pension income requirement. At this point, he will have to “surrender” his passport to the Italian Consulate in Los Angeles for three months for processing and approval of the visa.\n\nIn Nardò, he loves the small-town vibe and enjoys experiencing cultural clashes as he adapts to local ways of life. He now spends his days in Italy visiting nearby villages, sipping coffee in the morning at the many bars, and savoring local dishes at trattorias in Nardò, where foreign tourists are a rare sight.\n\nAdjusting to the Italian way hasn’t been all smooth sailing though. Particularly when it comes to frank conversational exchanges.\n\n“Several individuals have actually told me that they’re not being rude, but trying to save me time and money” in getting things sorted out.\n\nHe says it also took him a while to adapt to local closing times — with stores closing in the middle of the day.\n\n“I still haven’t gotten used to shops closing and opening when the proprietor feels ‘ready.’ I now just shrug it off, go for a coffee and relax. It’s part of the dolce vita.”\n\nRichardson’s path to a new life in southern Italy also seems to have avoided many of the bureaucratic pitfalls that some people complain of when moving to the country.\n\nThe process of buying a house was “a breeze,” he says.\n\n“Horror stories only exist because most people don’t do their homework. Before purchasing, the consultant and friends told me about the need of a codice fiscale (tax identification number). When I arrived in Italy I was told where to go to obtain an Italian number, which is mandatory as well.”\n\nHe says the real estate agency in Nardò assisted him in obtaining a bank account, which proved more difficult and time consuming than buying the house.\n\n“Banks need either your SSN (national health insurance number) or federal tax code number or both. The process took some three hours, but even now I am greeted with smiles from the representative that set up my account.”\n\nThe agency also found him a housekeeper who comes regularly to clean his place and keeps in touch with him. Her boyfriend, who works in construction, has become his go-to handyman, fixing any problems that come up at the house while Richardson’s away.\n\nOne big issue for Richardson has been the fact he’s not allowed to buy a car in Italy before acquiring a residence card.\n\n“I really can’t grasp that part of Italian law,” he says. In the meantime, he’s buying an e-bike and using rental cars.\n\nOnce he will relocate full-time to Puglia, Richardson says he’ll lease his home in Southern California to his twin brother, so as to always have somewhere to stay when he visits the United States.\n\nHe says he’s looking forward to enjoying Puglia’s mild winters, vast olive groves, quaint towns and villages, architectural beauty and amazing cuisine.\n\n“If you haven’t tried a bombette, you haven’t lived!”, he says. These are one of Puglia’s iconic recipes and street foods: savory fresh pork meatballs stuffed with cheese and pepper.\n\nAbove all, he says he has been won over by the open friendliness of the people, who are “genuine and sincere” and look out for one another.\n\n“I love the fact that on my small L-shaped lane there is a typical ‘Italian alarm and neighborhood watch’. It is a little old man that lives at the bend on the lane. He is out every morning investigating and greeting all throughout the day. He talks to and watches the gas delivery man and construction workers.”', '‘Italy’s Maldives’', 'Published 7:17 AM EDT, Wed April 16, 2025', 'he-moved-from-california-to-rural-italy-because-he-didnt-want-to-be-anywhere-near-a-mcdonalds-or-starbucks-1745808911'),

The tourism boom — which hit a record-breaking 10.5 million in the first three months of 2025 — has given the world’s fourth-biggest economy a needed kick but also created headaches for locals.\n\n“We hope to encourage more tourists, particularly those who typically visit high-traffic destinations like Tokyo and Kyoto, to travel to Oita instead,” a spokesman from Oita Prefectural Government’s tourism bureau told CNN on Thursday.\n\nOita is about one hour away from Osaka by plane and four hours by train.\n\nJoining Hello Kitty at the Oita airport are friends like My Melody, Little Twin Stars and Pochacco. All are characters from Sanrio, the merchandising company behind her universe of cuteness.\n\nWhy Oita, though? Sanrio runs a theme park called Harmonyland in the prefecture. The company will be selling exclusive Hello Kitty key chains and T-shirts at the domestic terminal.\n\n“In addition to attracting visitors not only from major metropolitan areas such as the Tokyo and Kansai regions but also by highlighting the unique appeal of Oita Prefecture and Kyushu such as hot springs, nature, and cuisine, we aim to leverage the global popularity of Japan’s Sanrio characters and their theme park,” Sanrio said in a statement.\n\n“We are filled with the hope that this airport will become a bridge connecting countless smiles,” Sanrio Entertainment President Aya Komaki said during a recent launch, before touting Hello Kitty’s slogan written on a flag she holds in posters at the airport: “Hello from Oita to the world.”\n\nOita prefecture sits about 40 miles southeast of Fukuoka, Kyushu’s biggest city, and is home to some of Japan’s most sought-after onsen towns, like Beppu and Yufuin.\n\nIt’s more popular among local tourists than international visitors, though. Almost 80% of 530,033 visitors recorded last month were domestic travelers.\n\nThe airport operates mainly domestic flights, but also runs a few international routes to Seoul in South Korea and Taipei in Taiwan.\n\nIt is not the first airport to name itself after the nation’s much-worshipped cartoon characters, with Japanese manga and anime being among the country’s most influential exports.\n\nIn the central city of Tottori, officials renamed its airport Tottori Sand Dunes Conan Airport in 2015 to pay tribute to “Case Closed,” a Japanese manga and anime series about a child detective, Conan, who battles criminals with cool gadgets a la James Bond.\n\nThe neighboring Yonago Kitaro Airport also took its name from another manga and anime series, “GeGeGe no Kitaro,” which follows the quest of a young boy named Kitaro who fights off demons — or yokai in Japanese — to protect humans.\n\nOther airports have also featured popular characters from Super Mario Bros and Pokemon in their tourism campaigns, even though they weren’t down for a name change.\n\nThe country with one of the most complex train networks in the world also puts its favorite characters on trains, including — guess who — Hello Kitty.', '', 'Published 9:39 PM EDT, Thu April 17, 2025', 'japanese-airport-given-full-hello-kitty-rebrand-for-world-expo-2025-1745808911'),

The sticky rice is aromatic due to its freshness.”\n\nThailand’s nam dok mai (water of the flower) mangoes are the most popular variety for the dish, as they possess a sweet flavor and smooth texture. Varee says some of the best nam dok mai mangoes are found in Chacheonseo province’s Bangkhla district.\n\nAnother popular variety used in mango sticky rice is Oak Rong, which she says has to come from Damnoen Saduak district in Ratchaburi province.\n\n“It is difficult to find, and only available a little bit in January and more in March and April,” she says.\n\n“Oak Rong is only famous among Thais, most foreigners are not familiar with this variety. They know Nam Dok Mai.”\n\nThough mangoes play the starring role in khao nieow mamuang, the other ingredients are just as important, says Varee.\n\nIn her shop, they use sticky rice grains specially selected from Thailand’s northernmost province, Chiang Rai. Coconuts come from Suratthani province, in the south, as they must have an intense flavor that complements the sticky rice. The yellow mung beans are baked, not fried, to give the dish a slight crisp.\n\n“Even the salt used in the cream, we order it from Samut Sakorn,” she says, referring to a coastal province south of Bangkok.\n\nAs for their customer base, she says they cater to a mix of Thais and foreign tourists.\n\n“I would say most of my foreign customers are from China, Hong Kong and Singapore,” says Varee. “When they are here, they will have to check-in on social media in front of my shop. They said if they visit Thailand and don’t check-in, they are not really in Thailand yet.”\n\nIt’s impossible to talk about Thailand’s love for khao neao mamuang without mentioning popular young Thai rapper Milli, whose real name is Danupha Khanatheerakul.\n\nIn 2022, she performed at the Coachella music festival in California and ended her show by digging into a bowl of mango sticky rice.\n\nThe act ignited a nationwide craving for the dish back in Thailand. In Bangkok, images on social media and news sites showed the city’s most famous mango sticky rice shops suddenly being inundated with orders, evidenced by the lineups of delivery service drivers waiting outside.\n\nAmong those to benefit from the Milli effect was K Panich. One of the oldest purveyors of mango sticky rice in the city, it first opened in 1932, just a 15-minute walk from the Grand Palace, a popular historic attraction.\n\nA sign hanging at the entrance of this tightly-packed traditional shophouse hints at its culinary credentials — it’s received Michelin’s Bib Gourmand award every year since 2019, a nod to its good value and high quality.\n\nDuring a recent visit, a small crowd has already gathered by 8:30 a.m., a mix of delivery drivers, local customers and foreign tourists sitting on wooden stools near the counter outside waiting for their orders. Tables, baskets and crates are piled high with bright yellow Nam Dok Mai mangoes.\n\nKhun Nan, a manager on site, tells CNN the secret to the shop’s longevity is their commitment to sourcing top ingredients from all over the country.\n\n“We focus on the quality of the raw materials,” she says, noting that dozens of foreign tourists visit the shop each day.\n\nFor those who just want to buy whole, uncut mangoes, K Panich allows its suppliers to set up outside the shop and sell their wares. That includes Saowalak Chaimeesuk, 54. When asked why the tropical fruits are such a popular summer treat in Thailand, she says much of it has to do with nostalgia.\n\n“In the old days we didn’t grow Nam Dok Mai all year, but now thanks to advances in agriculture we can have them during any season,” she says.\n\nMango sticky rice might be a popular street food, but it’s also a familiar site on dessert menus at high-end restaurants all over the country, with some featuring a modern twist.\n\nTwo Michelin-starred R-Haan in Bangkok, for instance, offers a refreshing “Home Sweet Home” Thai Mango Sticky Rice dish — a three-variety mango parfait served with sticky rice and coconut ice cream.\n\nAccording to R-Haan co-owner/chef Chumpol Jangprai, there’s evidence suggesting mango sticky rice has been around since Thailand’s late Ayutthaya period (1351-1767), with references to the dish found in the centuries to follow.\n\n“Recipes from King Rama V’s reign (1868-1910) mention ‘khao niew moon,’ which is glutinous rice steamed with sweetened coconut milk,” says the chef.\n\n“This was likely served with various fruits, including mangoes. Although not native to Thailand, mangoes have been cultivated here for a long time. This readily available fruit became a natural partner for the sweet sticky rice.”\n\nSo while khao nieow mamuang might not be an ancient dessert, he says its history reflects the fusion of Thailand’s culinary traditions with readily available ingredients.\n\n“It’s a testament to the ingenuity and deliciousness that Thai cuisine is known for,” says Chumpol.\n\nWant to try to make it yourself?

Socca is also a street food favorite in cities like Nice, where its served in paper cones and dusted with black pepper.\n\nIn Russia and other Slavic countries, these thin, round pancakes made with buckwheat flour and yeast usually come in bigger versions than those seen in many fine dining restaurants, where they’re often topped with caviar or smoked salmon.\n\nA staple of Russian cuisine, Blinis tend to come to the fore around Shrove Tuesday in a week of celebrations called Maslenitsa, or ‘“Pancake Week”. Pancakes every day for a week? We love the sound of it.\n\nDietary restrictions and preferences have seen countless takes on pancakes, but few can rival the delicious creativity of hemp protein pancakes from Michelin-starred chef Sven Wassmer at Verve by Sven at Switzerland’s Grand Resort Bad Ragaz.\n\nSwitzerland is known for its healthy breakfasts, and Wassmer’s gluten-free pancakes featuring hemp protein instead of flour, with toppings including bananas, almonds, maple syrup — and maybe just a touch of whipped cream — certainly fit the bill.\n\nThe Japanese name for this popular treat gives them away. “Hottokeki” – yes, hotcakes. These super fluffy, extra-tall beauties have taken Instagram by storm thanks to their souffle-like structure and texture, created by using egg whites in a meringue that’s added to the batter.\n\nTop them with anything from berries to fresh cream, maple syrup to bacon. Just don’t forget to post a picture before you tuck in.\n\nUnlike most pancakes, these fragrant, crispy triangles are actually made from dough, rather than batter, bringing about a crispy, flaky and chewy texture.\n\nEasy enough to make at home, some people like to dip them in sauces with soy or chili. But they’re great just as they are – hot from the pan or wok, flaky with the subtle kick of scallions. Regional variations include those from Shanghai which feature pork fat for extra decadence.\n\nFrench crepes would take some beating in the Pancake Hall of Fame — if there’s not one, there should be. These ultra-thin pancakes originated in Brittany in northwest France, way back in the 13th century, but have since become beloved the world over.\n\nThey can be either sweet with fillings like fruit preserves, syrups or chocolate, or savory, famously with ham and cheese, melted to perfection.\n\nWatching them being prepared is true culinary theater, as the batter is slowly coaxed to perfect consistency before being expertly folded over.\n\nThick and fluffy, drenched in maple syrup and often served with the contrast of salty, crispy bacon, few pancakes rival the decadence of a classic stack of American pancakes.\n\nAmerican recipes for pancakes date back to 1796 and “American Cookery’” by Amelia Simmons, even if her suggestion of “Indian Slapjacks,” made from cornmeal, have largely been forgotten.\n\nToday, the use of buttermilk in these classics leads to a finer crumb, extra fluffiness and a subtle tang. Wherever they’re served, just make sure to pile them high.\n\nA celebrated dish from Ashkenazi Jewish cuisine, Latkes contain another uncommon ingredient in the form of potato. But it wasn’t always so, as until the popularity of spuds grew in Eastern Europe in the 19th century, the recipe was all about cheese.\n\nToday grated potato, onions and eggs combine to make gloriously crispy fritters that are topped with sour cream, apple sauce, lox and more.\n\nPotato also features in this terrific Indian take on a pancake that can reach an extraordinary size. A popular breakfast treat in south India, but eaten throughout the day elsewhere, the batter is made from fermented rice and lentils, while the fragrant filling features potatoes with mustard seeds, coconut, turmeric and coriander.\n\nThey’re served with chutneys, which vary throughout the country, such as coconut, tomato, coriander or peanut, making for brilliant communal eating.\n\nTraditional pancakes in England would quite possibly make an American wince. Small and thin, they’re a million miles from the maple syrup-covered stacks so beloved in the US.\n\nBut there’s no doubting their own simple, elegant charms – assuming that you’ve managed to keep them in the pan, after tossing them in the air.\n\nThere’s really only one way to have them on Pancake Tuesday, as Brits call it: with a squeeze of lemon juice and sprinkling of granulated sugar.\n\nChina’s second entry comes in the form of the classic gossamer-thin translucent flour pancakes used to wrap slow-cooked Peking duck.\n\nPlain flour, water and salt are the humble ingredients used to make the dough, before the pancakes are gently cooked in a steamer basket.\n\nThen layer in your duck, add scallions and either hoisin or sweet bean sauce. At Woo Cheong Tea House in Hong Kong, Okinawa brown sugar is added to the duck sauce, making them even more irresistible.\n\nOK, it’s technically more of an unleavened flatbread, but beloved Ethiopian staple injera, a spongy and slightly sour creation made from teff flour, also ticks our pancake boxes. Here flour is mixed with water and ersho, similar to a sourdough starter, triggering fermentation.\n\nThis mixture is then poured in a pan or onto a traditional circular griddle called a mitad, ensuring a smooth underside and porous top perfect for scooping and soaking up sauces and other flavors.\n\nFrom the wild and beautiful Brittany region of northwest France, Breton galettes are a take on pancakes that make locals exceedingly proud.\n\nThese delicacies are made with healthy buckwheat flour folded over into squares to envelop not-so-healthy savory fillings such as ham, eggs, bacon, or cheese.\n\nGalettes are great when paired with a glass of apple cider — but don’t forget that in France, it contains alcohol.\n\nParticularly popular in the Washington state, these unusually named pancakes are also known as a Bismarck or a popover — while Brits would be forgiven for calling them Yorkshire puddings.\n\nBut there’s no confusion over the cooking method — they’re baked in metal pans in the oven. In the US, the puffy pancakes are often topped with butter, sugar and a squeeze of lemon or syrup.\n\nThe Canton of Obwalden sits right in the heart of Switzerland and is home to these unusual pancakes which are shredded before being served, usually at dinner.\n\nCholermus is cooked in butter and when they’re nearly done, the treats are cut up and fried until a perfect golden brown. Serve with sugar, a dusting of cinnamon and apple sauce. And probably repeat.\n\nThese small and fluffy pancakes are as proudly Australian as Vegemite. However, they’re not to be confused with a British dish of the same name.\n\nDown under, baking powder is added to the batter to make them rise. Once golden, they’re stacked and traditionally topped with cream, sugar and fresh strawberries — or strawberry jelly.\n\nOne of the world’s most delicious savory pancakes comes from Korea, and its hot, spicy and crispy combination of ingredients will have you coming back for more.\n\nKimchi is the beloved traditional Korean side dish of fermented vegetables, added to flour, eggs and more to make a batter. Once pan-fried, unique flavors combine into a sizzling, crunchy pancake, perfect for dipping — or eating just as it comes.\n\nFinally, to Venezuela and their fabulous thin, cheesy corn pancakes known as cachapas. The use of fresh or frozen corn provides the batter with a defined sweetness, while fresh cheese and butter make for irresistible fillings.\n\nThe key, as with almost our global selection of pancakes, is in the way they’re cooked. Fry them until they’re golden and crispy before letting the queso de mano cheese melt in the middle.', 'Socca, France and Italy', 'Updated 5:44 AM EST, Tue March 4, 2025', 'the-worlds-most-delicious-pancakes-1745808911'),

He documents his travels on his Publican Enemy blog and it’s taken him everywhere from Jakarta to Krakow to the Azores.\n\nCNN Travel joined him in The Woodbine pub in Finsbury Park, a North London neighborhood with a strong Irish history, to find out what he’s learned — and why he’s doing it.\n\n“I did one trip, and I just loved it,” says Dalton of his first adventure seven years ago in Bilbao, Spain, “a beautiful, beautiful city.”\n\nIn the tiny Wicklow Arms pub, he made new friends galore — including a man who knew Dalton’s father as his postman back in Kerry — and stayed the whole night for a lock-in. (That’s when the doors close and a select few stay on for a private party).\n\nFrom that point on, Dalton’s fate was sealed. “I just said, ‘This is great. I’ll continue it, and I’ll just try to go a different place every time,’” he explains. “I love to see how someone has interpreted the Irish pub, and (if it’s) a faithful interpretation.”\n\nThe London-based university lecturer had an upbringing that prepared him well for life as an international pub connoisseur.\n\nHe grew up in Fenit, a tiny village with “one shop and five pubs” on the north side of Tralee Bay, looking out over the Atlantic. His parents are musicians and have long played traditional music in the rural pubs for which Kerry is famous.\n\nIt’s a “beautiful part of Ireland” and the pubs are “by default, lovely,” he says. “But I think, as well, when you live in Kerry, you live by the sea, so there is an element of wanting to travel and go out a little bit, because you’re facing across to America.”\n\nIn countries where waves of Irish emigrants settled in the 19th and 20th centuries, such as Britain, North America and Australia, there are many pubs with authentic Irish history.\n\nThe Irish are also a people who’ve turned up in most corners on Earth, and many of them have opened pubs, so a true slice of Limerick can unexpectedly be found in Lima or a piece of Dublin in Dubai.\n\nErsatz Irish-themed pubs are everywhere too, however, having boomed as a marketable commodity in the 1990s and proliferated ever since.\n\nThe Loch Ness pub on the French island of Corsica is one of the most egregious examples he’s visited, says Dalton, what with Loch Ness being in Scotland, an entirely different country.\n\nIf the pub is named after an Irish surname, that’s a good sign, says Dalton, as it suggests it was named after an owner or family.\n\nThe Irish do pubs “amazingly well,” says Dalton, when pondering just how Irish pubs became so popular internationally. “We have the hospitality, the atmosphere, the being generally very nice and friendly.”\n\nHe highlights also that the best pubs are fiercely independent and as unique as someone’s home. “It’s their house and you’re a guest there,” he says. “You’ve got to be able to control a pub.” It’s about people management, rather than customer service.\n\nIn terms of atmosphere, “music is integral,” says Dalton, and it’s far more important than the emphasis that is often put on alcohol. “I see the pub as a nice space, so it doesn’t instantly go with me to excessive drinking. It’s more the space and the people.”\n\nDalton now often goes on his trips abroad with his partner, but at the beginning he went on his own and “you just end up talking to people.” This cultural exchange has been key to the experience, with different crowds being drawn to the pubs in different countries.\n\nIn European countries such as Italy, France and Germany, “the Irish pub is seen as the alternative pub,” he says, where students and backpackers can “live out their James Joyce, the Pogues dream.”\n\nIn southern Spain, where many British expats choose to spend their later years, it’s “retired people just enjoying a nice pint in the sun.”\n\nFurther afield, as he found in Kazakhstan and Indonesia, Irish pubs are “a little bit high status” and a popular choice with business people, due to the expensive imported beers and Western appeal.\n\n“To be an up-and-coming modern city, you have to have an Irish pub,” he says. “It’s very international, it’s very touristy, where, like, all the expats go.”\n\nIn Malmö, Sweden, he visited a pub that was “really wild … they were dancing on the table, literally,” which went against his perception of calm, well-behaved Scandinavians.\n\nHe spoke to one reveler and she explained, “We love the Irish pub because it gives us an excuse to go mad.”\n\nIn countries with a reputation for being reserved and rational, such as Germany or Japan, Dalton finds that the romantic illusion of the Irish as being “rebels” who “don’t care about things like taxes and, like, laws” is “very attractive for them.”\n\nThen there are places where there is a shared musical connection, such as in the States, where country music has links to Ireland’s folk traditions. ”Things about the countryside, farmers, rural banjos, you know, fiddles, that’s our culture as well,” he says.\n\n“I think American bars are very good. I was in one in Marfa, Texas, called the Lost Horse Saloon and live music was the key,” he says.\n\nAs for Austin, Texas, with its famously eclectic music scene, its bars reminded him most powerfully of Galway city, in Ireland’s very own wild west.\n\nIn Brazil, he says he visited an “authentic” bar in São Paulo called O’Malley’s, where the local Brazilian music session, with “people sitting in a circle with, like, drums and a little guitar and stuff like that” was very similar to the Irish style.\n\nDalton has recently visited Estonia and Iceland and the far-flung Faroe Islands, in the North Atlantic, are top of his wishlist. He also wants to visit O’Kelly’s Bar in Guantanamo Bay, although he admits that might be a tricky one for him to gain access to.\n\nIn Africa, he’s been eyeing up Bubbles O’Learys in Kampala, Uganda. The southernmost Irish pub in the world is The Dublin, in Tierra del Fuego, at the tip of Patagonia and close to Antarctica.\n\nAs for the highest Irish pubs in the world, there are two contenders for that crown: Paddy’s Irish Pub in Cusco, Peru, and Namche Bazaar in the foothills of the Himalayas. “I’d be happy with either one,” he says.\n\nGiven that the Irish Pubs Global Federation estimates that there are at least 6,500 Irish pubs worldwide, Dalton concedes that he might not achieve his goal of visiting every single one.\n\n“I have to agree that I probably won’t,” he admits with a grin, “but I do think that I would have a very good time attempting it.”', 'The call of the sea', 'Published 7:00 AM EDT, Sat March 15, 2025', 'the-man-on-a-mission-to-visit-every-irish-pub-in-the-world-1745808911'),

Sanders was widely expected to be picked early on with several teams in need of a quarterback.\n\nAfter hearing his named finally called, Sanders celebrated on the Twitch social media platform and called his draft slide “perfect timing.”\n\n“Our belief in God, that’s all we care about. We know these decisions, things happen, sometimes it’s adversity,” the 23-year-old said. “You just got to remain positive, stay happy at all times and know God got you. … So I wasn’t really panicking because I understood it’s about perfect timing.”\n\nBrowns general manager Andrew Berry told reporters he didn’t expect Sanders to be available in the fifth round but said the team believes in adding compettion for every position.\n\n“Obviously, Shedeur has kind of grown up in the spotlight, but our expectation is for him to come in here and work and compete. Nothing’s been promised, nothing will be given. I hesitate to characterize (the pick) as a blockbuster. That’s not necessarily how we thought of the transaction, but we are excited to work with him.”\n\nDespite not getting picked on Thursday or Friday, Sanders did remain positive, saying “Thank you GOD for EVERYTHING,” in a post on X Friday night.\n\n“Given the nature of the weekend for him – relative to let’s say external expectation versus what happened – you know we did tell him that it really doesn’t matter where you’re picked, it’s what you do from that point forward,” Berry added.\n\n“In terms of his reaction, I’d just say it was probably a mixture of like gratitude, relief and determination, that would probably be the best way to characterize it. But he’s certainly ready to go.”\n\nFive quarterbacks were selected before Sanders.\n\nOn Thursday, the Tennessee Titans selected University of Miami’s Cam Ward with the No. 1 overall pick and the New York Giants chose Jaxson Dart (25th overall) from Ole Miss in the first round.\n\nFriday saw three quarterbacks picked - Louisville’s Tyler Shough (40th overall) to the New Orleans Saints in the second round while Alabama’s Jalen Milroe (92nd overall) and Oregon’s Dillon Gabriel (94th overall), Sanders’ teammate, found new homes with the Seattle Seahawks and Browns respectively in the third round.\n\n“I think every player when they come into the draft, knows what number they were picked or if they were unpicked, and you can use that for motivation,” Browns head coach Kevin Stefanski said. “First round pick, seventh round pick, undrafted, once you’re here and you’re on our football team, you’re a part of this culture, you’re a part of this family, and we’re just gonna keep our head down and get to work.”\n\nSanders, the former four-star recruit coming out of high school has only been coached by his father, Pro Football Hall of Famer Deion Sanders, during his four-year collegiate career that started at Jackson State University in 2021.\n\nAfter two seasons with the Tigers, Sanders followed his father to Boulder, Colorado, to play at Colorado ahead of the 2023 season along with JSU teammate Travis Hunter, who was drafted second overall by the Jacksonville Jaguars on Thursday.\n\nSanders was prolific in his two seasons under center for the Buffaloes, leading them to a 9-4 record last year while throwing for 4,134 yards, 37 touchdowns and 10 interceptions.

But Gordon had other ideas, slamming the ball down with 0.1 seconds on the clock before wheeling away in jubilation.\n\nWhat followed was nearly three minutes of suspense as Gordon and Co. waited on the court for the referees to determine whether he had released the ball before the buzzer had sounded. When it was announced that he had, the Nuggets’ celebrations restarted in earnest, and boos rang out from the crowd at Intuit Dome.\n\nWhether they wanted to or not, the LA crowd had just witnessed NBA history – Gordon’s slam was the first game-winning, buzzer-beating dunk ever made in the playoffs since the dawn of the detailed play-by-play era in 1997-98.\n\n“Nice pass,” Gordon joked with Jokić at their post-game press conference.\n\n“Joker was trying to get in his bag with the Sombor Shuffle. He’s made shots like that before. So, I’m just trying to clean up everything on the glass. He shot it with enough time to give us a chance to rebound it,” the former Slam Dunk Contest finalist added. “I was just in the right place at the right time.”\n\nThe Nuggets led by two points at halftime, but arguably the most notable event up to that point had come with 6.6 seconds remaining in the second quarter.\n\nWhen James Harden was fouled by Christian Braun near midcourt, Harden began exchanging words with the Nuggets shooting guard. The resulting skirmish saw Gordon rush in and catch Norman Powell’s face with an open hand.\n\nDespite Clippers fans chanting “Kick him out!” Gordon received a technical foul, along with Harden, Braun, Powell, Jokić and Kris Dunn.\n\nDenver went from strength to strength in the third quarter, outscoring LA 35-17 to open up an 85-65 lead. But, spurred on by 10 points by Kawhi Leonard, the Clippers fought back in the fourth quarter and took the lead for the first time in the game with 1:11 remaining thanks to Bogdan Bogdanović’s offensive rebound and basket.\n\nA free throw and a basket from Jokić made it 99-97, before Ivica Zubac appeared to send the game to overtime. Gordon’s heroics ensured that would not be the case.\n\nGordon finished with 14 points, six rebounds and five assists. Jokić led the scoring with 36 points, 21 rebounds and eight assists – in doing so becoming only the fourth player in NBA history to rack up at least 35 points, 20 rebounds and eight assists in a playoff game.\n\nBraun and Michael Porter Jr. each added 17 points for Denver, while Leonard led the scoring for the Clippers with 24 points, nine rebounds and two assists.\n\nIt is the second time in the series that the Nuggets have prevailed by fine margins – they won Game 1 by two points in overtime. Game 5 takes place in Denver on Tuesday night.\n\nElsewhere in the NBA, Steph Curry ensured that the Golden State Warriors did not miss the injured Jimmy Butler, racking up 36 points, seven rebounds and nine assists in a 104-93 win over the Houston Rockets to take a 2-1 lead in the series.\n\nMeanwhile, the Oklahoma City Thunder became the first team to make it to the second round of the playoffs, completing a four-game sweep of the Memphis Grizzlies with a 117-115 victory.

In 1992, when Michigan’s guard and center Matt Elliott was drafted as the 336th pick, he had no idea.\n\n“This was truly the last years before the internet,” he joked to CNN. “I think it was (Washington) coach Joe Gibbs who told me, ‘Some people from California are going to call you, it’s called Irrelevant Week. It’s gonna be fun. Just understand that it’s gonna be fun!’”\n\nHistorically, most players who’d been picked last didn’t have much of a career in the NFL, in fact many never even played a game. So, in 1976, the late Paul Salata decided that he wanted to give them something to smile about. He had been a 10th round pick as a receiver in 1951, scoring four NFL touchdowns in a fleeting professional career. But his greatest contribution to the league began when he invited the 487th pick Kelvin Kirk to Newport Beach in California.\n\n“Mr Irrelevant” and “Irrelevant week” had been born; it’s since become one of the most endearing concepts in sports.\n\n“With the exception of maybe the first round,” Hoag posited, “I don’t know that anybody in their right mind would be drafted anywhere other than Mr. Irrelevant. My mom still jokes about it to this day, it was this out of body experience for our family, we were treated like royalty for the entire week.”\n\nThe event is now run by Salata’s daughter, who told CNN that planning for the week begins from backstage as soon as the draft is over. Irrelevant Week takes place in Newport Beach, California, featuring a parade in honor of the draftee, a “roast and toast” dinner and a golf tournament. The festivities are tailored to each athlete, and they are encouraged to submit a wish list.\n\n“Many players have never seen the ocean before,” Melanie Salata-Fitch told CNN. “The player usually wants a surfing lesson, so we have famous surfers teach him while a party is happening on the beach.”\n\nThere are VIP trips to Disneyland and the Playboy Mansion, players have met celebrities like Will Farrell and Jimmy Kimmel and driven the cars of their dreams. As a single man, Hoag appeared on “The Bachelorette” reality TV show.\n\n“I just remember sitting up there on one of those big lifeguard chairs on the beach,” quipped the 2009 Mr. Irrelevant Ryan Succop to CNN, “all these people are celebrating you and bringing you gifts and I’m kind of sitting there going, ‘Man, what in the world am I doing?’”\n\nAt the end of the week, the players leave Newport Beach with more than just fond memories. Stuffed into their luggage is the Lowsman Trophy, a tongue in cheek reference to the Heisman Trophy given to the best NCAA player every season; the player depicted is fumbling the ball.\n\n“Most people would think it’s the hollow plastic that you get at a sporting goods store,” explained Hoag. “Nah, this thing’s bronze. It’s 10 pounds. This is the real deal my friend, it’s hilarious. I love it!”\n\nEvery Mr. Irrelevant is encouraged to show some humility and to lean into the spirit of the event, but the dubious honor doesn’t necessarily signify the end of their professional dreams.\n\nThe 1994 draftee Marty Moore played alongside Tom Brady in his first Super Bowl victory in 2002. Kicker Succop played alongside Brady in his final Super Bowl triumph for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in 2021, whilst the 262nd pick in 2022, Brock Purdy, played in the Super Bowl for the 49ers just two years later.\n\nYoungsters in the school yard might have an idea of what it’s like to be picked last – it can be humiliating. But the Mr. Irrelevants say there is no shame, because they are selected ahead of potentially a hundred other college players who aren’t selected at all. Just a few hundred players are drafted every year.\n\n“You’re more likely to be struck by lightning than drafted in the NFL,” said Hoag. “That’s pretty special.”\n\n“I didn’t really care how I got my start,” said Succop, who knew that as a kicker who’d be a late round pick at best. “It does not matter how or where you get your start, what matters is the way you prepare, and when your opportunity comes, are you ready? Use this opportunity, don’t take the irrelevant title as a negative.”\n\nSuccop says that whenever he played, he always knew if there was a Mr. Irrelevant on the opposing team and they’d be sure to connect before or after the game. Many still attend the events in Newport Beach and have formed lifelong friendships, and they are always rooting for each other. Matt Elliott says he only cares about two picks in every draft these days, the first and the last. Asked to put a value on the experience and benefits of being Mr. Irrelevant, he said it was priceless.\n\nWhat started out as a gentle tease half a century ago has turned into something uniquely wonderful.\n\nCrediting the founder Paul Salata, Hoag said, “He was just like, let’s celebrate somebody, and do something nice for somebody, for no reason. Especially in this day and age of dog eat dog, when everything’s politicized and negative, you need more of people wanting to lift up others for no other reason. It’s nice to have a breath of fresh air.”\n\n“This is the one thing that will never happen to you again and it’s only happened to 49 people in the world, so live it up.”', 'Irrelevant Week', 'Updated 9:08 PM EDT, Sat April 26, 2025', 'the-best-things-come-to-those-who-wait-heres-why-being-mr-irrelevant-in-the-nfl-draft-is-priceless-1745809151'),

Tune into any frequency and you will find it – elation, anxiety, exhaustion, pain, pride, awe, pathos.\n\nMore than 56,000 runners will line up on the start line of the London Marathon on Sunday, each one with a different reason for being there.\n\nMany find that motivation in running for the charities which have helped them or their loved ones during the darkest times in their lives – the London Marathon has raised over £1.3 billion ($1.7 billion) since its inception. Others find it by using running to control their physical and mental health, set themselves goals or try a new challenge.\n\nFor Julie Wright, those two go hand-in-hand. Four years ago, her daughter Vicki died at the age 34 from breast cancer, leaving behind two young sons. And as Wright spent more and more time looking after them, she realized she had to get fitter.\n\n“We take so much for granted when we’re younger … and as we get older, we think we can still do it … we think we can just pick up a skipping rope and skip and it’s not like that at all,” she tells CNN Sports.\n\nAt the same time, running helped Wright in “some really, really dark places” after the loss of her daughter. She settled on the idea of a marathon “to celebrate getting to 60 and still being alive,” as well as to raise money for Breast Cancer Now.\n\nNow targeting her third marathon, Wright, her family, and her community have raised thousands of pounds for the charity.\n\nThe lingering presence of her daughter and mother, who passed away in January, accompanies Wright on her runs. On one hand, she wears her mother’s wedding ring, and on the other, she wears a gold band her daughter gave her just before she died.\n\n“I’ve got mom on one finger and (Vicki) on the other … So when I’m having to dig really deep, I put my hands behind myself a little bit as if I’m flying … and it’s like I pretend I’m grabbing Mum’s hand on one side and my daughter’s on the other,” she says.\n\n“And that gets me through the next five minutes. And once I’ve got through that next five minutes, I’m just getting on.”\n\nSimilarly, for 19-year-old twins Katie and Anna Rowland, the memory of their dad Jim sustains them through long training runs as they raise money for the Southern Area Hospice, which cared for him in his final days.\n\n“If someone can lie in a hospital bed … and the pain that they can be in, I remember the pain daddy was in … if I can run for four, five hours, it’s nothing compared to what they can do,” Katie tells CNN Sports.\n\nThe pair signed up for the marathon on a whim after seeing a Facebook post from the hospice, in an attempt to “say thank you” and to give “a bit of money for what (they) did for us,” Anna adds.\n\nThere is power in running for a cause, says David Wetherill, a former Paralympic table tennis player aiming to set a world record for the fastest marathon while using crutches, a feat he estimates will involve completing around 42,000 dips – about one every meter.\n\n“It’s a struggle for me to even walk 250 meters,” he says, explaining his hip is currently not in its socket due to multiple epiphyseal dysplasia – a genetic disorder which affects bone growth and leads to early onset arthritis.\n\n“So it is mad to try and explain that I’m then going to go and run a marathon, but it’s so much easier for me to motivate myself to do the extraordinary than to do the mundane in my life, even though the pain levels are pretty much the same,” he tells CNN Sports.\n\nPutting himself through such a grueling task, Wetherill says, is only possible by maintaining a stoic mindset – “if it’s endurable, endure it” – and because of his commitment to raise money for research seeking a cure for type 1 diabetes.\n\nTwo of his best friends and one of their young daughters all have the condition. Wetherill says his friends’ purpose has “become my purpose.”\n\n“When it’s you at stake, that’s nowhere near as powerful as people you really really love,” he adds.\n\nAnd in the process of training, Wetherill has become “addicted” to pushing his body, drawing from a “perverse kind of motivation, where I lean into the pain, the cure for pain is in the pain.”\n\nSigning up to a marathon means committing to weeks of training beforehand, juggling work and family commitments at the same time. For the past few months, Luke Roche has balanced his full-time job in sales with raising two children under two and his marathon training, often waking up at four or five in the morning to go for a run before work.\n\n“I could not have done it without (my fiancée) Beth,” he tells CNN Sports. “If I could get a second (medal) I would because she’s done just as much helping me train as I’ve done for myself.”\n\nRunning a marathon means so much to Roche that when he found out he had secured a place, it “broke” him, he remembers, his voice cracking. “It all fell into place. It was running for my granddad, running for my mate. It meant a lot,” he says.\n\nRoche is running to raise money for The Donkey Sanctuary, a charity long supported by his late granddad who sponsored one of the donkeys there, visited it often, and made it the subject of the collection at his funeral. “I thought (it) was brilliant, so random and very unique and very him,” Roche says.\n\nAnd by taking part in the marathon this year, Roche can run it with his friend who is running in memory of his 18-year-old sister who passed away last year.\n\n“That’s why I am running the marathon!” Jennie Toland says as one of her daughters interrupts to ask a question. “She’s the reason why.”\n\nBefore having her daughter Rose, now aged three, Toland had suffered seven consecutive miscarriages. “I had no energy left, I was mentally just distraught,” she recalls. “It’s a lot of grief and a lot of seeing your life go in a completely different direction from where you thought it was going to go.”\n\nEvery doctor had told her and her husband to stop trying for a baby and, as a last resort, Toland was up late one night, scouring the internet for any glimmer of hope.\n\nThere, she stumbled across Tommy’s – a charity which funds research seeking to stop miscarriage, stillbirth and premature birth. She took part in a clinical trial funded by the charity and, though she still doesn’t know if she had the medication or the placebo, she has since had two children.\n\n“We started talking about how to say thank you, because sending someone … a nice letter when they’ve given you your whole life … it just doesn’t seem enough to say thanks,” she says.\n\n“I just wanted to do something. And then I watched a marathon last year and thought that’s a really good idea. And I’ve since been questioning those life choices.”\n\nIn the last seven years alone, the number of people applying to run the London Marathon has more than doubled, rising from 386,000 in 2018 to more than 840,000 this year.\n\nSunday’s race is expected to set the record for the most participants in a marathon, surpassing the 55,646 finishers at last year’s New York City Marathon.\n\nThe 26.2-mile distance continues to appeal for novice and experienced runners alike. Josh Elston-Carr, co-founder of FLYCARB and a former track runner who has recorded a sub-four-minute mile, turned to the marathon in search of a new challenge when his love for middle-distance running began to fade slightly.\n\nWhen Elston-Carr first took up running as a junior 20 years ago, he joined an athletics club, the “traditional route in” at the time. Over the past two decades, he has seen more and more people take up an increasingly accessible sport thanks to “the rise of parkrun and run clubs,” he tells CNN Sports.\n\nThe running bug can be addictive. Liz Newcomer, a running influencer, never intended to compete in marathons. She began running “two or three miles every other day” as a way to improve her mental health and feared longer distances before her manager suggested running a half-marathon.\n\n“Even after the half, the next weekend I ran 13 miles again, and then the next weekend maybe I ran 14 and … I realized that I really loved it. And it got to a point where people asked me, ‘Are you training for a marathon?’”\n\nFive years on and Newcomer is preparing for her 10th marathon, transformed by distance running. The sport, she says, has helped her deal with “body image issues” and a relationship with food that “wasn’t super great at the time.”\n\n“I definitely see my body more as like a car and when I need to eat, to fuel the car, I see it more as … something where I have to fuel for performance,” she says.', '‘How to say thank you’', 'Updated 10:28 AM EDT, Sun April 27, 2025', 'why-more-people-than-ever-before-are-running-marathons-1745809151'),

And continued to slide, eventually all the way out of the first three rounds, leaving experts shocked, who had largely expected him to be one of the first quarterbacks off the board.\n\nDespite not getting picked in the first two days of the three-day event, Sanders remained positive, saying “Thank you GOD for EVERYTHING,” in a post on X Friday night.\n\nThere were signs in the lead-up to the first round that maybe Sanders would fall in the draft.\n\nOn Thursday, the first couple times that ESPN cut to Canton, Texas, where Sanders was watching the draft, the set – covered in the player’s own logo – was empty. Eventually, cameras found Sanders watching the draft but he wasn’t exactly looking confident.\n\nThe Colorado quarterback had once teased being picked by the New York Giants, wearing custom red, white and blue cleats during a game when the G-men were the top candidate for the first overall pick. A few days ago, he was making comments about how he would be throwing passes to receivers in Pittsburgh.\n\nBut when the Steelers passed on him with the 21st pick, with Oregon defensive tackle Derrick Harmon finding his way to the Steel City, it suddenly seemed possible that Sanders could drop all the way out of the first round. And then the Giants traded back into the first round with the 25th pick and were reportedly looking for a quarterback.\n\nInstead of Sanders, it was Ole Miss QB Jaxson Dart who would be making the trip to the swamps of New Jersey to play for the Giants.\n\nFriday saw three quarterbacks selected ahead of Sanders - Tyler Shough to the New Orleans Saints in the second round while Jalen Milroe and Dillon Gabriel found new homes with the Seattle Seahawks and Cleveland Browns respectively in the third round.\n\nSanders not getting selected drew the ire of many media experts and prominent figures including President Donald Trump, who put NFL teams on blast.\n\n“What is wrong with NFL owners, are they STUPID?” Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social Friday. “Deion Sanders was a great college football player, and was even greater in the NFL. He’s also a very good coach, streetwise and smart! Therefore, Shedeur, his quarterback son, has PHENOMENAL GENES, and is all set for Greatness. He should be “picked” IMMEDIATELY by a team that wants to WIN.

If you want to fight it out we can do that. We can fight to see who goes to the second round.”\n\nCNN has reached out to the Orlando Magic and the NBA for comment. Ahead of Game 2, in response to a question about the physicality and defensive mindset of his team, Magic head coach Jamahl Mosley said: “I think it’s great. I think it’s who we have been since we got here. These guys embrace the challenge, the defensive focus, the defensive mindset, hanging our hat there.”\n\nBrown clarified after Game 3 that he had dislocated his finger, adding: “But I got nine more so I’m alright.”\n\nPorziņģis echoed the sentiment that the Celtics had to fight back. “I mean, they’re just borderline fouling,” he said. “That’s what it is.

Media is fractured in ways it hasn’t been since before radio. You have a million different things you can watch or follow at any given time.\n\nThat’s what makes the NFL so incredible. Not only do millions tune in to watch their team’s games, and also nationally televised games of other teams … but even their draft has become a primetime event.\n\nMany are going to sit around this over the draft’s three days to watch players they’ve never heard of before get selected out of college to join an NFL franchise.\n\nAnd so, on a weekend where college kids wearing suits and taking photos while holding up new jerseys will steal thunder from the NBA playoffs, pretty much everything is trending up for the NFL draft.\n\nTrending Up:\n\nDraft viewership: Up 7.6 million from 2007\n\nWhen I say millions of people watch the draft, I mean many millions. Last year, more than 12 million people watched the first night of the NFL draft. It was higher rated than the series finale of the CBS hit “Young Sheldon.”\n\nIt didn’t used to be that way. When the NFL first started tracking the number of viewers (not just households) in 2007, fewer than 5 million tuned into the first day of the NFL draft.\n\nEven the final day of the draft (featuring the final rounds) managed to pull in nearly 3 million viewers last year. The opening round of the NHL playoffs are averaging less than a million this season.\n\nMore than 53 million people watched some portion of the draft in total. Woof. Quite an achievement given the NFL draft was only first broadcast in 1980.\n\nTrending Up:\n\nPick #1’s salary: Up 86% from 2007\n\nIt’s not just viewership that is up: It’s the salaries too.\n\nNFL rookie salaries are dictated by a wage scale – first implemented in 2011 as part of the league’s collective bargaining agreement.\n\nThe top pick in the draft gets paid handsomely. The 2024 No. 1 overall pick, quarterback Caleb Williams, pulls in nearly an average of $10 million in guaranteed salary per year from the Chicago Bears on his rookie contract, according to Spotrac, a website that tracks player contracts.\n\nThe salary for Cam Ward, the No. 1 overall pick this year, is projected to have a contract worth more than Williams.\n\nBack in 2007, before the wage scale was in place, quarterback JaMarcus Russell yanked in a little more than $5 million per year in guaranteed salary from the then-Oakland Raiders.\n\nStill, I think the argument could be made that the Bears got a steal. The top average NFL quarterbacks this year rake in more than $50 million. It was closer to $10 million in 2007. Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott makes, on average, $60 million per year!\n\nThis means the salary gap between getting a top quarterback in the draft and what he will make down the line has grown exponentially.\n\nTrending Up:\n\nDays on TV: Up 1 since 2007\n\nPerhaps there is no bigger sign that the draft is a big deal than its length. The draft used to be just two days.\n\nThen in 2010, the NFL got the idea to give the first round its own day. You can’t argue with the results in terms of ratings.

My mom wasn’t with me, she’s at the hospital right now on life support,” the 21-year-old said, per CNN affiliate WPXI.\n\n“After I get off the phone with you guys, I’m going to head straight to the hospital and tell her her son got drafted,” Harmon added, appearing to become emotional.\n\nSaine passed away shortly after that visit, according to Pittsburgh Post-Gazette writer Gerry Dulac.\n\n“On behalf of the entire Pittsburgh Steelers organization, I extend our deepest condolences to Derrick Harmon and his family during this difficult time,” team president Art Rooney II said in a statement Friday.\n\n“Though we are excited to select Derrick in the first round of the NFL Draft, our hearts are heavy as we mourn the death of his mother, Tiffany Saine. We will support Derrick and his family however we can as he navigates this period of grief. In times like this, we hope Derrick finds comfort in the love and support from the organization and Steelers fans around the world.”\n\nDuring Harmon’s freshman year at Michigan State, Seine had a stroke that left her paralyzed on the left side of her body, Harmon told ESPN in an interview ahead of the draft.\n\nPrior to that, she underwent numerous brain surgeries during his childhood, Harmon said.\n\nAs Harmon continued to develop as a football player, the Detroit native chose to stay close to home, playing three years for the Michigan State Spartans.\n\nSaine, who Harmon described as his “rock,” was instrumental in encouraging her son to make the 2,000-mile journey across the country to pursue his football dreams at the University of Oregon.\n\n“We had a discussion and she told me every decision I had made up until this point was for her, and it’s time to make a decision for myself,” Harmon told ESPN.\n\nEven though he was on the other side of the country, Saine remained in the forefront for Harmon. Before Oregon’s appearance in the Rose Bowl last season, Harmon revealed that his biggest purchase using his NIL money was buying a van for his mother and her wheelchair.\n\nGoing into the draft, Harmon credited his mother for his success.\n\n“She’s the reason why I’m here,” Harmon said to ESPN. “She’s the one that did everything for me to get to this point.

The Cleveland Browns followed up with a shocking trade to the Jacksonville Jaguars, which ultimately saw Travis Hunter go to the Jags.\n\n• Shedeur Sanders slides: The Colorado standout and son of NFL star Deion Sanders was expected to be among the first players drafted. Instead, he’s dropped down in the draft and slipped out of the first round.\n\n• Plenty of intrigue on the off-season’s biggest night: Headline quarterbacks were predicted to go near the top of the first round but didn’t. After Ward went No. 1, the only other QB to hear his name called was Jaxson Dart at No. 25 to the Giants.\n\n• How to watch: Fans can watch all the picks on NFL Network and ESPN. The draft continues on Friday and Saturday.\n\nHere are all the players drafted in the first round of the 2025 NFL draft:\n\nThe story of the night ended up being a player who wasn’t drafted.\n\nShedeur Sanders, the son of Pro Football Hall of Famer Deion Sanders, who starred at Colorado for the last two years, was widely expected to be picked early on, where several quarterback-needy teams were waiting.\n\nInstead, Sanders slid. And slid. And continued to slide. Eventually, he slid all the way out of the first round, stunning experts who had largely expected him to be one of the first quarterbacks off the board.\n\nThere were signs that something was up. The first couple times that ESPN cut to Canton, Texas, where Sanders was watching the draft, the set – covered in the player’s own logo – was empty. Eventually, cameras found Sanders watching the draft but he wasn’t exactly looking confident.\n\nThe slide echoes that of Aaron Rodgers, when a highly touted college quarterback dropped and kept dropping in the 2005 player draft. Eventually, Rogers was picked No. 24 in the first round by the Packers, but a similar lifeline would not be extended to Sanders.\n\nThe Colorado quarterback had once teased being picked by the New York Giants, wearing custom red, white and blue cleats during a game when the G-men were the top candidate for the first overall pick. A few days ago, he was making comments about how he would be throwing passes to receivers in Pittsburgh.\n\nBut when the Steelers passed on him with the 21st pick, it suddenly seemed possible that Sanders could drop all the way out of the first round. And then the Giants traded back into the first round with the 25th pick and were reportedly looking for a quarterback.\n\nInstead of Sanders, it was Ole Miss’ Jaxson Dart who will be making the trip to the swamps of Jersey to play for the Giants.\n\nIt’s possible that Sanders might come off the board with the first pick of the second round as the quarterback-light Cleveland Browns have the 33rd pick of the draft. It seems very unlikely that Sanders makes it too far into the second round before being snatched up.\n\nSome key takeaways from tonight:\n\nBig trade shakes things up: The first headline-grabbing moment of the night came early when Jacksonville traded its No. 5 pick and a slew of other picks to the Cleveland Browns to move up to the No. 2 position. The Jags then used that pick to grab Travis Hunter, a potentially game-changing player who excels on both sides of the ball. The Browns used their No. 5 pick on Mason Graham, a defensive tackle out of Michigan.\n\nCam Ward ends one stage of an incredible journey: Ward started his career as a zero-star recruit who went to Incarnate Word. Years later, he’s the No. 1 overall draft pick, headed to Nashville to play for the Tennessee Titans. He was left in tears by the selection, saying he was just remembering himself as a “little kid who wanted it.” That kid is now the franchise cornerstone for the Titans.\n\nPlayers from College Football Playoff teams dominate: Sixteen of the 32 players drafted came from the teams that made the College Football Playoff, including four from national champions Ohio State, three from Georgia and three from Texas. Big-time players from big-time schools who have played in big-time moments are obviously at a premium.\n\nNew York Giants have a great night: If it’s a make-or-break year for the New York Giants, they got started on the right foot. First, they took Abdul Carter, an edge rusher out of Penn State, who is probably the best defensive player in the draft this year. Then they traded back into the first round to grab Ole Miss quarterback Jaxson Dart. It was a moment that some people thought Shedeur Sanders would be picked, but the Giants instead opted for Dart.\n\nJosh Simmons was the last pick of the first round, but that likely wouldn’t have been the case if not for a season-ending injury early in the 2024 season.\n\nSimmons started the first six games for the Ohio State Buckeyes and was still good enough to be an honorable mention all-Big Ten selection. His torn patellar tendon in his left knee cost him 10 games and he likely would have been a much higher selection if he had been able to play the full season.\n\nHe’ll be a solid addition to the protection for Patrick Mahomes and company.\n\nWith the final pick of the night, the Kansas City Chiefs pick Josh Simmons, an offensive tackle from Ohio State.\n\nMaxwell Hairston might be small, but his speed is out of this world.\n\nHairston goes just 5-foot-11, 183 pounds, but he ran a 4.28 40-yard dash at the combine, flashing his speed.\n\nHe had five interceptions in 2023 and had a pick-six in 2024, though he missed much of the season with a shoulder injury.\n\nHe’ll be expected to bolster a lackluster Buffalo pass defense and provide game-changing turnovers.\n\n“Buffalo is picking the ultimate competitor, the ultimate teammate and they got someone who’s getting Josh Allen the ball back,” he said with a laugh in an interview with ESPN.\n\nThe Philadelphia Eagles are continuing to add young talent to their championship defense after selecting Jihaad Campbell with the No. 31 pick.\n\nThe Alabama Crimson Tide linebacker was a first-team All-SEC after leading the team with 117 tackles, 11.5 tackles for loss and five sacks.\n\nThe two foes who met in the Super Bowl earlier this year have swapped first round picks as the first round comes to a close.\n\nThe Philadelphia Eagles are now on the clock after moving up one spot following a trade with the Kansas City Chiefs. Chiefs will now select at No. 32 and received a fifth round pick as well.\n\nAt No. 30, the Buffalo Bills take Maxwell Hairston out of Kentucky, adding to their defensive backfield.\n\nThe pick was announced by Tommy, the second Make-A-Wish foundation honoree to make a draft announcement on Thursday.\n\nWhile that one fan in Green Bay may have mocked the Lions for selecting Tyleik Williams, he’ll fill a role at which they sorely need depth.\n\nThe Lions defensive line was devastated by injury last year, including tackle Alim McNeill, who was having a stellar season before tearing his ACL.\n\nWilliams is a big run-stopper in the middle of the defensive line, going 6-foot-3, 334 pounds. In the run-heavy NFC North, he’ll play a massive role in containing the ground games of Detroit’s opponenets.\n\nHe tallied 46 tackles, including eight tackles for loss and 2.5 sacks for the Ohio State Buckeyes as they ran to a national championship last year.\n\nJayden Daniels is getting himself more protection as the Washington Commanders selected offensive tackle Josh Conerly Jr. with the 29th overall pick.\n\nOut of the University of Oregon, Conerly was a third-team Associated Press All-American and a finalist for the Joe Moore Award (nation’s top OL).\n\nWashington is coming off a surprising season that saw them make it to the NFC championship game and will look to get back there by building in the trenches.\n\nThe Detroit Lions selected Tyleik Williams, a defensive tackle out of Ohio State, with the 28th pick.\n\nThe pick was much to the chagrin of a fan who was seated next to one of ESPN’s mics in Green Bay, who laughed loudly and said, “You guys are crazy” a few times.\n\nJames Pearce Jr. is a big, fast prospect for the Falcons.\n\nThe 6-foot-5, 245-pound Pearce ran a 4.47 40-yard dash at the combine and uses that explosive speed to make quarterbacks’ lives difficult. He had 7.5 sacks last year for the Volunteers after having 10 sacks as a sophomore in 2023.\n\nIf he can be consistent and evolve his technique, Pearce might be a fixture in NFL backfields very soon.\n\nAnother Bulldog is off the board as the Baltimore Ravens selected Malaki Starks with the 27th overall pick.\n\nThe Georgia safety led the team in tackles last year with 77 and was named a second-team Associated Press All-American. He was also a finalist for the Jim Thorpe Award for the second consecutive year.\n\nStarks will join All-Pro safety Kyle Hamilton in John Harbaugh’s defense this upcoming season in Charm City.\n\nJames Pearce Jr. out of Tennessee is the 26th pick, heading to the Atlanta Falcons.\n\nThe trade between the Rams and Falcons almost certainly means Shedeur Sanders is going to fall all the way out of the first round unless one of the teams selecting in the final six picks makes a shocking choice.\n\nBaltimore chooses next, followed by Detroit, Washington, Buffalo, Kansas City and Philadelphia.\n\nWell, another trade!\n\nThe Atlanta Falcons are on the clock after trading back into the first round with the Los Angeles Rams.\n\nJust like everyone thought, er, um, Jaxson Dart is now the second quarterback off the board.\n\nThe 21-year-old – who started three years in Oxford under head coach Lane Kiffin – is coming off an impressive season, throwing for 4,279 yards, 29 touchdowns and six interceptions.\n\nHe joins a crowded New York QB room, who signed Russell Wilson and Jameis Winston this offseason.\n\nDart will follow the path of another Rebels QB – Eli Manning, who was under center for the Giants for a long time, leading them to two Super Bowl wins.\n\nWelp… The Giants have passed on Shedeur Sanders but selected another signal caller with the 25th pick.\n\nNew York has taken Ole Miss quarterback Jaxson Dart.\n\nSanders, who once sported custom Giants cleats in game, continues his draft day slide.\n\nWe got our second trade of the night and this time it sees the New York Giants trade with the Houston Texans to get back into the first round.\n\nIs this where Shedeur Sanders gets selected?\n\nThe love fest in Green Bay is over.\n\nAfter massive cheers for Golden, the boos rain down on the Minnesota Vikings, who select Donovan Jackson, a guard from Ohio State.\n\nJackson was a three-year starter for the national champion Buckeyes. He was named to the all-Big Ten first team twice and was second team all-Big Ten as a sophomore.\n\nHe was drafted as an offensive guard but he also started nine games at left tackle – a crucial position for protecting the quarterback – for OSU this year.\n\nThe 6-foot-4, 315-pound Jackson was described by NFL.com as the “guard prototype.” He’ll play a big role in protecting JJ McCarthy as he embarks on his first season starting for the Vikings.', '', 'Updated 12:22 AM EDT, Fri April 25, 2025', 'cam-ward-goes-no-1-overall-and-shedeur-sanders-slides-out-of-the-first-round-of-the-nfl-draft-1745809152'),

After all, the Cairo native didn’t know a single thing about football until he arrived in Southern California almost seven years ago.\n\nNow, with the support of his brother and coaches at Loara High School and Boise State, Hassanein has become a monster on the gridiron. Boise head coach Spencer Danielson says he’s the best edge rusher to come out of the Mountain West Conference powerhouse in a long time. Off the field, he’s even more impressive.\n\n“Knowing his character, knowing his work ethic, knowing his journey, knowing his testimony, I’d be willing to bet everything I have on him,” said his half-brother, Cory Besch, before the draft.\n\n“And I think any team that’s willing to invest in him is going to not just get a football player, but they’re going to get somebody who’s going to represent their team, their culture better than any other prospect in the draft. I will put that part of his skillset against anybody. The leadership, the passion and the fact that he is an untapped, unrefined diamond that is still being discovered.”\n\nChosen by the Detroit Lions in the sixth round on Saturday, Hassanein racked up 24 sacks as a Bronco, most of which came after he took over the starting edge rusher job as a junior. He was a first-team all-conference player in the 2023 and 2024 seasons and was a captain in his senior season. It’s an impressive resumé for any college player, but even more so for the still-raw Hassanein.\n\nIn less than a decade, Hassanein has moved across the world, learned English, learned football and the unique language of the sport, adjusted to the culture shocks of Orange County, California, and Boise, Idaho, converted from Islam to Christianity and found himself as a leader in the locker room, on the field and in the community.\n\nBut Danielson said Hassanein is more than just his story: He’s also a hell of a football player.\n\n“I don’t want people to get it twisted. There’s a phenomenal story about Ahmed, right? Everything we talked about, who he is as a person – Egypt to California to Boise,” Danielson told CNN Sports before the draft. “I don’t want people to get it twisted: Ahmed’s one of the best football players in the nation.\n\n“There are so many things about his life that are just make it an amazing story. But, oh man, he’s gonna get drafted because he’s gonna have a monster impact on the field in the NFL. I just want that to be known for people – you’re not only just getting a great story, you’re getting a big-time football player.”\n\nHassanein moved to the United States from Egypt just before his sophomore year of high school after Besch made a visit to Cairo and realized the half-brother, who he hadn’t seen in 10 years, might have a future on the gridiron. Besch played football in college at Azusa Pacific University and entered coaching after his college days were done, though he still played in Europe. After one of those semi-pro seasons in Austria were finished, Besch went to Egypt and realized his little brother wasn’t so little anymore.\n\nThe then-15-year-old Hassanein was about six-feet, one-inch tall and weighed about 215 pounds, a CrossFit enthusiast and looking like he could succeed in football – a sport he’d never played and didn’t know anything about.\n\n“At the time, I had just finished playing a professional season, a semi-pro season, in Austria, so I was still in pretty good shape. And I worked out with him and when I was working out with him and holding my own, and he was holding his own with me, I could tell there was definitely potential,” Besch said. “I knew what the game of football had done for me, giving me a purpose and identity and the life lessons that I had learned and continued to teach the next generation. I just knew that that that would benefit him.”\n\n“I didn’t necessarily know that he was going to be a great prospect, but I knew that he needed to get out of that environment, and I knew that football was an avenue and a tool to help him do that.”\n\nHassanein’s home life in Egypt wasn’t great at the time and that led to issues in school and his personal life, but he found an outlet in the gym. When Besch pitched him, and the rest of his family, on Hassanein moving to Southern California and trading the CrossFit gym for the football field, the future defensive star jumped at the chance.\n\nFrom there, it was the start of one of the most intense learning curves imaginable.\n\n“He walked in here, and obviously he’s a good-sized kid, as big as anybody we had,” said Mitch Olson, his coach at Loara. “And he was athletic. He did CrossFit in Egypt.\n\n“When we got him out on the field, he knew nothing. He didn’t know formations, nothing. So what we did is we’re going to put him at defensive tackle. It’s the easiest, and we’ll just tell him a couple things to do. And right away, he was just so strong and just dominating. In fact, we didn’t spend as much time developing him as we should have, because we had to get other kids going.”\n\nHassanein arrived in the United States not knowing the language, not knowing the game and only just getting reacquainted with his brother who was now his primary guardian in the US.\n\nThere was some healing that needed to be done, Besch said.\n\n“I didn’t actually know what I was getting myself into when I take my brother in. I didn’t know how difficult his struggles were. I didn’t know how difficult the language barrier was going to be. I didn’t know what it was right like to raise a 16-year-old boy. I knew what it was like to raise a 10-year-old little girl, right?” he said, referring to his daughter.\n\n“But I didn’t know what that meant. Didn’t know how much he was going to eat. I didn’t know all of the challenges and things, but I did know that God had me there for a reason … and I knew that God’s calling on my life as a coach was purposeful.”\n\nHassanein worked hard at his game – and at learning English. Olson said within about three months, Hassanein went from knowing very little English to understanding what was being said and being able to communicate effectively.\n\nLearning the rules of football, though, was a bit more of a challenge.\n\n“We start playing games and, in every game, he gets a 15-yard penalty because he didn’t know the rules,” Olson said. “The first game he played in, about the first series, he grabs the quarterback’s face mask and just body slams him, and he gets flagged.\n\nHe added: “Next game he’s on the punt return team and he tackles a guy who’s running down trying to make the tackle. … So we taught him a bunch of stuff, but then there was a whole bunch of stuff that he learned. But I’m telling you, halfway through his first year, you’d have thought he’d been playing football for two, three years.”\n\nA lot of that work got done at home with Besch, whose furniture sometimes suffered for it.\n\n“Any detail you can think of about the game, I’m having to explain to him, whether that’s around the kitchen table, in the kitchen,” Besch said. “We’re working on how to get leverage on a blocker. He’s throwing me into cabinets. It was insane. Literally, it was just a whole learning process every second of the day.”\n\nEventually, the process of learning football evolved from an excuse for a fresh start in the US to a potential career path. As he played more and worked more and learned more, Hassanein decided that football was all he wanted to do.\n\nFirst, he told Besch. Then he told Olson. The goal wasn’t just to play in high school or college. The goal was the NFL.\n\n“It’s everything for him,” Besch said. “I mean, his identity was 100% (football) once he got here, there was no other motivation. And it’s weird because the goal wasn’t to send him here to become a football player, but we knew that was going to be part of it, because that’s what our lives consist of. But I didn’t ever necessarily expect him to take it on so personally and for it to become his passion.”\n\nThe challenges Hassanein faced were immense. Not only was he brand new to the sport that he wanted to play professionally, but he also went to a school that was not exactly a football powerhouse.\n\nIt took a little time for Hassanein to realize exactly what it would mean to lift himself to the lofty heights of Division 1 football, let alone the NFL. It was a conversation with Besch that made it click.\n\n“He’s telling me, ‘This is what I want to do. I want to be a Division I football player.’ And I’m seeing him maybe not being as motivated and really understanding what that looks like, because it’s not just working out, right? It’s everything you do,” Besch said.\n\n“If you’re going to be that type of guy, it’s got to show up in the way you carry yourself around the house, around school, pick up after yourself – just how you handle responsibility. And I was getting frustrated as his brother, because I’m seeing him not doing that.\n\n“So, I remember telling him one day, I said, ‘Bro, I need you to do me a favor. I have homework for you.’ And he goes, ‘What is it?’ I said, ‘It’s football homework. I want you to think about: ‘What does it take? What is the number one player in the country doing every day?’ If you were to imagine a Division I football prospect does every single day, write it down right from the time he wakes up to the time he goes to sleep. What does his day look like?\n\n“And so he did. He wrote out a list: He wakes up early, he eats healthy, he takes his vitamins, he drinks water, he does this, he studies, he watches film and all these things. And then I told him, ‘OK, now that list you just made, compare that to what you do every day.’ How much of this are you doing? Because it’s great to say it, right? It’s a whole other thing to actually do it, because it’s not easy, or everyone would do it.”\n\nHassanein’s response to that conversation was simple: “OK, I get it.”\n\nOlson said that from that point on, he’d never seen a player work as hard. Hassanein put on 20 or 25 pounds of muscle each year of high school, woke up at 5 a.m. for workouts, watched film constantly and practiced his craft.\n\n“I don’t think I’ve had anybody just put that much work out, but he doesn’t know any other way,” Olson said. “I’ve never seen him do anything half ass. He has one speed. He’s the guy in practice that you hate because he doesn’t go half speed. He is old school, an old school kind of a guy. And he’s an absolute worker.”\n\nAfter his junior season, with the scholarship offers still not coming in the way that they wanted, Hassanein had to deal with a new obstacle: The Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nThe virus closed down high school athletics across California and suddenly it seemed like Hassanein’s best opportunity to make a good impression – the summer camp circuits where high school players regularly get discovered – might go out the window. After months of sending tapes around and trying to get in touch with college coaches, Hassanein and Besch finally found an opportunity to showcase his skills at a camp about 30 minutes away from their home.\n\nBesch told Hassanein that it was his best shot at getting recruited, and he sold his brother to anyone who’d listen, including as they’re filling out the paperwork to register for the camp.\n\n“I’m basically selling him to these guys. I see a scout in the background, and his ears perk up when I say that he’s only been playing football for two years,” Besch said. “He’s from Egypt, and nobody knows who he is. The scout literally audibly says, ‘Well, that’ll change after today,’ like he says that in the background, and that’s when I knew. I was like, OK, he’s passing the eye test.”\n\nA standout performance at that camp against some of the state’s top prospects got the ball rolling. But it was an old connection from college and a video of Hassanein working out in a mask that started his path to Boise.\n\nDanielson was the defensive line coach for Boise at the time and happened to come across a video of Hassanein on social media. When Hassanein told Besch that Danielson had sent him a message, it seemed the pieces were falling into place.\n\nBesch and Danielson played together in college at Azusa Pacific and were friends, though they had grown apart in the years since school. But the connection still existed and Besch reached out to Danielson to try and get his old friend truly interested in his brother.\n\n“He was sending me videos of literally him in a garage, pass rushing, striking,” Danielson said of Besch.\n\nThe coach remained skeptical. Besch is a great athlete but he was built more like an undersized slot receiver than a defensive end.\n\n“You hear that he’s 6’3”, 215, but you’re like, is he really?” Danielson said. “You get him next to a door frame, right? You’re like, trying to figure out exactly how big he is.”\n\nBesch tried to sell his half-brother on Boise as other schools came calling, but all it took was a virtual tour – no on-campus visits were allowed due to Covid – for Hassanein to sign up to head to Idaho.\n\nOn a virtual call with Danielson, Hassanein decided to commit. He didn’t tell Besch he was doing it, and it seemed out of the blue.\n\n“Just in Ahmed fashion he said, ‘Coach, I trust you. I don’t know anything about Boise, Idaho. I don’t really know even much about football, but I trust you and that you’re going to help me become the best version of myself,’” Danielson said.\n\nStill the nerves over how big Hassanein really was – was he really six-foot-three when his brother was about half a foot shorter? – were present throughout the Boise defensive coaching staff.\n\n“I knew what time he was being dropped off, and me and our entire staff were waiting to see him get dropped off to make sure he was 6’3”,” Danielson said. “We’re like, ‘Please don’t be 5’11,” like, did we just get hoodwinked? And he pops out of the car and looks like a Greek god. And I’m like, ‘Yep, we’re good boys.’”\n\nFor Besch, it was a time of mixed emotions – he was thrilled for his brother, but now it was no longer his time to be Hassanein’s personal coach. He had to trust the staff at Boise to keep him growing. But he figured Hassanein was in good hands.\n\n“Knowing that Spencer was the guy helped me immensely, because I knew that if there was one person I could entrust, you know, not just the development of him as a football player, but the development of his character … I knew he was going to be a positive person under Spencer Danielson,” he said.\n\nAfter getting some time as a true freshman – becoming the first Egyptian player in FBS history – and playing in 12 games as a second-stringer as a sophomore, Hassanein finally got a chance to start as a junior at Boise. He seized that opportunity with gusto.\n\nHe turned in a first-team all-Mountain West Conference season, ranking fifth in the FBS with 12.5 sacks, making 53 total tackles including 16.5 for loss and forced two fumbles.\n\nIt was the moment those close to him had been waiting for.\n\n“Before his junior year, you saw a lot of talent, but you saw a very robotic person that was a pleaser and trying to do exactly what he was told to do,” said Erik Chinander, who took over as the defensive line coach at Boise late in 2022.\n\n“And somewhere in that next fall camp before his junior year, kind of when he had that breakout year, you saw him stop thinking and playing a little bit more freely, and taking what people were giving him instead of exactly what he was coached to do or exactly what the playbook said.”\n\nThe change was noticeable to Olson, who drove more than four hours to catch Boise’s game against Fresno State in the 2023 season. Olson said he waited to greet Hassanein outside the locker room at the stadium after the game, and what he saw from Hassanein’s teammates made clear that something special was going on.\n\n“The way the guys treated him was he was the guy,” Olson said. “And I called his brother, who was back in Boise. I go, Cory, I’m sitting there, and he had had about eight sacks by then, and I think it was about three quarters of the way through the season. I told Cory, ‘I’m standing outside the locker room, and he didn’t see me, and I’m just watching the guys interact with him.’ I go, ‘He’s the guy, Cory.’”\n\nFor Besch, that 2023 season was the realization of all the work he and his brother had done in those kitchen technique sessions, the still-not-close-to-finished product starting to look like a star.\n\nIt was a year later that he realized his brother was really going to have a solid chance at being a professional because he kept succeeding even though defenses were starting to game plan against Hassanein.\n\n“I knew that, as a football coach, it’s great to have a breakout season but the next year is going to be exponentially more difficult because every single coach on the other side of the ball is game planning for you,” he said. “You’re going to get all the attention, you’re going to get all the double teams, you’re going to get all the chippers, and you’re still going to have to perform if you want to make it, because this is Boise State. You don’t get to have a down year. You need to have, you know, eight, nine sacks and continue to progress, or else you fall off the cliff.\n\n“And when he started doing it, still, (with a) sack in Oregon early in the game. It’s like if you’re doing it against those guys, then you can do it against anybody.”\n\nThat production on the field was created by an incredible devotion to his game off of it. Hassanein became known around Boise as one of the hardest working players on the team, someone who was devoted to getting better each and every day and was simply grateful for the opportunity to play.\n\n“He puts in a ton of time, not only in getting to the building early to get his body ready, get his nutrition right, all those kinds of things, but like, he’s always in the film room,” Chinander said.\n\n“And it’s not just busy work for him. He’s in there, and he’ll come grab us and want to ask questions, like real questions. He’s got multiple notebooks that are full of coaching points he’s got from the head coach, from me, from Coach (Jabril) Frazier. You know, it’s one thing you’ve got to be careful (about) with Ahmed – is he is going to write down what you say? So you’ve got to choose your words wisely, because he will write it down.”\n\nDanielson called him “the most grateful young man you’ll ever be around,” a player who would thank coaches after a hard day of practice, get coffee for staff, treat everyone around him with respect.\n\n“He’s got the football skillset, the talent that I think means he’s gonna be a long-time NFL pro,” Danielson said before the draft, “but he is going to immediately change the culture of the NFL team he goes to, because of how grateful he is, because of the kind of teammate he is.”\n\nThe knock on Hassanein among draft prognosticators was that he’s still a pretty raw prospect, not the kind of guy who’s going to come in on day one and start blowing away NFL offensive linemen.\n\nBut those close to him say give him a couple years and he might be one of the best edge rushers in football.\n\n“He’s going to be a guy who’s going to get drafted here in the next few days that you know may not start quite at the level of some other guys,” Chinander said before the draft, “but as you draft him and you’re working with him for the next early portion of his career, he’s going to get better and better and better. And where he’s at now – it’s not even close to where he’ll finish his NFL career.”\n\nBesch, who knows him best, believes his half-brother has reached about 70% of his potential.\n\n“That’s the secret of the draft, to be honest. I have a unique perspective as a football coach and as his brother and seeing where he’s at, I would say he’s 70% of his potential,” Besch said days before his brother’s selection. “If you take that ability and that coachability, and relentless effort and motor and desire to grow and develop, and you give it to an NFL coach who actually wants to develop him … the sky’s the limit.”\n\nAs NFL scouts and executives prepped ahead of the draft, they well aware of all the players who they could have at training camp this summer as a part of their team.\n\nBut if they needed one final sales pitch from Danielson, he’s happy to give it.\n\n“Ahmed can play in any defense you want,” he said a day before the draft’s first round. “He can be a four-down D-end, he can be an outside linebacker in the 3-4. That’s uncommon. I’ve been here for nine years, and we put out a lot of edge guys in the NFL, and we’ve had some of the top defenses in the country, and he’s been the best edge guy that we’ve had, that (is) not only violent in the run game but can absolutely impose his will on tight ends and offensive tackles.\n\n“And I would urge people to watch Oregon and Penn State, watch those games. Watch the top tight end in the country and see how that went against Ahmed. I mean, just watch it.”\n\nHassanein’s history-making place as the first Egyptian ever selected in the draft is something he’ll wear with pride, Chinander said. It will be the culmination of a long, unexpected journey that ultimately Hassanein has made on his own, but one in which so many other people feel incredibly invested.\n\nOlson, his high school football coach who believes Hassanein is as fine a young man he’s ever come across in his 34 years of coaching, said he gets tears in his eyes watching his former player succeed on the field.\n\n“That’s why I get emotional. It’s just, I’m just so happy for him. He’s worked his butt off. And a lot of times you don’t see that,” Olson said. “You don’t see guys reap the fruits of their labor. And hopefully he will – somehow, whether he gets drafted or not – somebody will pick him up and he’ll make it just because of the guy he is.”', 'From Cairo to Orange County', 'Updated 9:12 PM EDT, Sat April 26, 2025', 'ahmed-hassanein-became-the-first-egyptian-ever-selected-in-the-nfl-draft-its-the-next-chapter-in-an-improbable-story-1745809152'),

But in the hours after the win, the 20-year-old was quick to praise all the help he received in his preparations.\n\nIbragimov posted a photo on his Instagram of his training staff in Dubai, a group which included two of the greatest MMA fighters ever in Khabib Nurmagomedov and Islam Makhachev.\n\nPerhaps it is no surprise that Ibragimov has had such success – he is 9-0 in his blossoming career with his sights set on the top – when he has such legends in his corner.\n\nIbragimov is the latest in the production line of mixed martial arts talent to come out of Dagestan, Russia, with Nurmagomedov and Makhachev acting as figureheads and role models for the new generation.\n\nFor a region with a population of just over three million – smaller than Los Angeles – it has become renowned for churning out top-level fighting talent, famous for their wrestling abilities and never-say-die attitude.\n\nIbragimov – who fights in the Professional Fighters League (PFL) – is part of the most recent generation of Dagestani fighters who are taking over the sport, and he says that for he and compatriots, fighting is a way of life, not just a profession.\n\n“In Dagestan, guys really want to be fighters. In the whole of Europe, there’s not many guys who really want to be fighters,” Ibragimov told CNN Sports. “They just pretended like they are fighters. They want to be like fighters. They want to be like someone.\n\n“But in Dagestan, there’s so many guys that really want to be fighters. Not all (European fighters). I’m not speaking for all of them, but I’d say like 30% or 50% of the guys, they don’t really want to be there. They just go in there for a hype and stuff like that, for Instagram.”\n\nWhile fighting might be a walk of life for some, it’s more than that for many Dagestanis.\n\nMichael Lyubimov, a famed MMA coach who has worked with many Dagestani fighters including Nurmagomedov, explained that when he often first encounters athletes from the Russian republic upon their arrival in the US, they are already vastly experienced.\n\nLyubimov – who is general manager of the Jackson Wink MMA Academy in New Mexico, renowned for its production of MMA talent – says that many young Russians take up fighting out of “despair from a young age.”\n\n“Back where they come from, there’s absolutely nothing. A lot of these guys that come here, I mean, they fought since they’re like six years of age,” Lyubimov – who was born in Moscow before moving to the US as a youngster – told CNN.\n\n“By the time they get to the UFC or obtaining these big promotions or come to America, they have over 200 fights and stuff.”\n\nHe added: “There’s no other option. There are cauliflower ears everywhere. It’s just who they are. It’s in the culture, engraved in them.”\n\nLyubimov also highlights the faith of the fighters from the region as a reason for their success, with many of them practicing Muslims. That means they often don’t drink or party and choose instead to focus on their craft.\n\nThe combination of those factors breeds a relentlessness in Dagestani fighters, according to Lyubimov. He recounts an athlete once telling him that he “will die in there before anything happens.”\n\nMany fighters from the region will put their bodies through significant hardship to sign with big-money promotions, often waiting until they’ve inked deals before undergoing the necessary treatment to heal their ailments.\n\nLyubimov highlights to CNN Sports the journey of Ismail Israilov, from neighboring Chechnya, who recently won a fight after dislocating his shoulder in the first round. Before coming to the US, Israilov had been in a truck accident in which he almost lost his hand and, at the age of 24, has over 200 street fights to his name.\n\nWhen Lyubimov asked Israilov what his upbringing was like back in Russia, the Chechen detailed how he came to have the resilience he now displays in the octagon.\n\n“‘My whole life was like, you have a piece of bread in your backpack, and you drive for like an hour and a half to wrestling practice, and sometimes you can’t make it because it’s so far away or whatever, so we’d just fight on the street and practice on the pavement,’” Lyubimov recounts Israilov saying.\n\n“‘We live in the middle of nowhere in the mountains. You look one way and there’s nothing there, you look the other way and there’s nothing there. All we have left is to fight.’”\n\nDuring his time as part of Nurmagomedov’s coaching team, Lyubimov spent plenty of hours in the gym with the former UFC great, in both the US and his native Dagestan.\n\nCompared to the current commercial gyms he works in now, the centers in Dagestan are vastly different environments with their hyper-focus on discipline, says Lyubimov.\n\n“In Dagestan, gyms are government funded or recreational where people can come in. A lot of it is somewhat free, to a certain extent, until, of course, they make it to the big level where they start paying coaches and they’re like at a higher level, professional level,” he said.\n\n“But at the beginning level, most of it is free. That’s why if you see Khabib when he walks into the room, or when Abdulmanap (Nurmagomedov’s father) would walk in into the room, all the fighters get up, they line up, they bow down, they’re quiet, they don’t talk, they’re always on time, they don’t talk back to elders, they have absolute major respect.\n\n“If you show disrespect to an elderly person or coach or whoever, your peers will put you in place and you can literally get slapped like by a coach and you will be quiet about it and you stand there and take the criticism and them yelling at you if you’re being a dumbass.”\n\nThat rugged upbringing builds character and toughness. For Lyubimov, this sets the perfect platform from which to build a career.\n\nWhen Lyubimov starts working with Dagestani fighters, it is often a case of refining their skills rather than adding more to their repertoire.\n\n“Obviously America is Mecca for making the name for yourself, right?” he explains. “The lights are much brighter when they hit the American promotions. So, it’s just about teaching the composure, keeping emotions under check, and refining the skills.\n\n“It’s teaching them how to adapt and how to just refine their skills in general, just making better fighters, understand the game better, understand the rules better, understand what to expect better, get them to deal with medicals, with fight preparations, with weight cutting. The diet, the weight cuts, everything because they do it one way over there. They come here, then they have to kind of relearn, or learn new things.”\n\nThe golden example of having to adjust to the American system was Nurmagomedov, who arrived in the US as a little-known prospect and blossomed into the biggest name in the sport.\n\nHis rise to prominence in the UFC was the jumping-off point for Dagestani dominance across the Western MMA scene.\n\nBetween his grappling skills, undefeated record and his customary wearing of Dagestan’s traditional papakha headpiece in the ring, Nurmagomedov became the hottest topic in the UFC despite not getting involved in the war of words which often previews fights or helps build rivalries between competitors.\n\nHis popularity grew to a previously unseen level through his rivalry with Conor McGregor, and then he retired a few years later. Lyubimov, who helped train Nurmagomedov during his heyday, said that the fighter understood that he needed to engage in sparring matches to continue to build his profile.\n\nSince retiring in 2020, Nurmagomedov has transitioned into a mentor for the next generation of Dagestani fighters. He has had a hands-on effect on the burgeoning career of Makhachev, who is the No. 1 ranked pound-for-pound fighter at the moment and the current UFC lightweight world champion.\n\nElsewhere in the UFC, another Dagestani – Magomed Ankalaev – became UFC light heavyweight champion in March, while there are other world champions in MMA competitions around the world from the Russian region.\n\nBefore his most recent fight in January, Ibragimov trained with Nurmagomedov and Makhachev in Dubai and says the experience in the gym with two of MMA’s luminaries and his Dagestani “brothers” was formative for his burgeoning career.\n\n“When you train in Khabib’s gym, and then, especially when he’s in there controlling you, there’s no limits,” he told CNN Sports. “It’s like sometimes he doesn’t even set the timer for training. And then we just train non-stop. We just roll nonstop, until he says stop.”\n\nIbragimov explained that a young Dagestani’s MMA journey is made that much easier because the previous generation has already walked that path and is around to give advice where needed. “They already showed us the road that we have to follow,” he said.\n\nIbragimov – who moved to Manchester, England, as a youngster and has siblings who are part of the Manchester United academy – has a long journey ahead of him in his MMA career. But in Nurmagomedov, Makhachev and other Dagestani fighters, he’s got the perfect role models showing him the way to the top.', '‘Despair from a young age’', 'Updated 10:57 AM EDT, Thu April 17, 2025', 'i-will-die-in-there-before-anything-happens-why-this-region-of-russia-produces-so-many-mma-champions-1745809152'),

Knowing that it’s possible to make it happen and it was beautiful. It’s a moment that gives me goosebumps every time I remember it.”\n\nPerhaps there is no better word that sums Andrade up than “comeback.”\n\nThe 25-year-old had considered quitting gymnastics after suffering three ACL tears – in 2015, 2017 and 2019 – one of the most brutal injuries for any athlete to overcome.\n\nThere is not only the painful and monotonous physical rehabilitation required after each major surgery, but also the grueling mental drain of facing one of the most arduous recovery processes in all of sports three times.\n\nNot to mention the lingering fear that it could happen again with a slightly miscued landing or take off. Those setbacks – each of which could have been career-ending – made Andrade’s win over Biles in the floor final in Paris all the more remarkable.\n\nSo, what was it that gave Andrade the motivation to keep battling back?\n\n“I think it has a lot do with the strength of my family and my team,” she said. “Every day in the gym showing me that regardless of my choice, if I wanted to carry on or not, they would be there to support me.\n\n“I was sure that it was worth coming back, every time, and I returned alongside them and the results followed, so I’m very proud.”\n\nAndrade, Brazil’s most decorated Olympian of all time with two golds, three silvers and a bronze, said being awarded the Comeback of the Year award “means a lot.”\n\n“It’s recognition of my work, that of my team and of my story as an athlete, and so I feel very honored.”\n\nThe nail-biting battle in Paris – Andrade and Biles were separated by just 0.033 points – understandably has fans eager to see the two gymnastics greats go head-to-head at the Olympics again at Los Angeles 2028.\n\nBiles remains unsure whether she will still be competing then, telling French newspaper L’Equipe this week that “2028 seems so far away.”\n\nShe also noted concerns over her body’s ability to keep pushing at the top level, revealing that her body “literally collapsed” after competing at Paris last year.\n\nAndrade, however, said she wants to be there.\n\n“Only God knows the future.

Because they live in a specific suburb in the outer part of this city,” he tells CNN Sports. “And they are – all of them – at risk of being recruited to the gangs. Some of the boys we are working with are already in gangs. Some of them are on their way to being recruited, and some of them are not yet there.”\n\nThe suburbs where they hold night football sessions are socioeconomically disadvantaged areas, where people often lack access to well-paid jobs, frequently due to language barriers. This creates a breeding ground for criminal activity, Wirehag explains.\n\n“Criminal lifestyles emerge in places where there is no money. This leads to people wandering around with nothing meaningful to do. They are at risk of being drawn into a lifestyle of making quick money in an easy but criminal way. That’s why we run activities on Saturday nights – because that’s when they tend to roam around the most.”\n\nOne of the participants on the night CNN visits is 18-year-old Abdulraof Alchaieb, known as Abudi to his friends.\n\n“Every Saturday night, I’m here. It’s a war on the field,” he tells CNN.\n\nThe “war,” in fact, seems to start at team selection. Starting out, Wirehag thought the best idea would be for him to pick the teams. Growing up in a Swedish culture, he didn’t like the thought of the boys picking teams themselves, since someone would always be everyone’s last choice.\n\n“They then chose to leave, in protest against my team selection,” says Wirehag. “I was given the tip to let the guys decide themselves, and ever since then, it’s been working perfectly.”\n\n“Perfectly” is not the term everyone would choose to describe the chaos unfolding, but after 10 minutes of loud arguments, the teams are chosen. Abudi, who also plays on the under-19s for first-division Swedish club Sunnersta AIF Fotboll, is one of the team captains.\n\n“If I hadn’t had football, I think I could’ve slipped into crime. When you’re my age, 15, 16 or even 14, older guys can easily play with your head. Like, ask you to go and drop this bag to this person and then already there, you’ve taken a big step. ‘Hold this’ while they are running away, and then you’re standing there with a bag of drugs.\n\n“The people you thought were your friends will stab you in the back. There’s not much of a dear friendship when it comes to the street. I know people who haven’t made it out.\n\n“You can’t just say you don’t want to continue. Then you’re letting them down, and in worst case, they’re looking for you – and in worst case, you die.”\n\nWhen it comes to gang crime, Wirehag says the start of this year has been tough. January saw a record number of explosions with an average of more than one bombing per day taking place, not counting failed attempts and preparations prevented by the police.\n\nExplosives are frequently used in criminal conflicts and extortion. Homemade bombs, smuggled pyrotechnic products, and hand grenades are easy to access. Perpetrators of violent crimes, such as shootings or bombings, drug-related offenses, or fraud, are easily recruited through chat groups and digital platforms, according to Swedish police.\n\n“Gang crime is a network problem. It exists everywhere throughout Sweden,” Hanna Paradis, former head of the National special operation “Frigg” - a police initiative created in 2023 to combat rising gang violence – tells CNN Sport.\n\nIn a report published in 2024, Swedish police estimated that 62,000 people were active in or had connections to criminal networks.\n\n“Crime is developing at a rapid pace. Ten years ago, we saw that young people perhaps over time began to commit more serious crimes. Today, that time is considerably shortened and that is because these networks recruit young people by advertising a lifestyle that may not actually be true,” says Paradis.\n\n“Gang crime has evolved into a kind of gig economy. Criminals post temporary “jobs” in various apps, and younger individuals, tempted by money or status, may take up these offers. However, young recruits rarely receive any actual payment—even if they don’t get caught”, explains Dennis Martinsson, legal expert in Criminal Law and researcher at the Swedish National Council for Crime Prevention.\n\nSweden has one of the highest firearm related death rates in Europe, which is closely linked to criminal backgrounds in socially disadvantaged areas, according to a 2021 study by BRÅ, the Swedish National Council for Crime Prevention, of over 20 European countries.\n\n“Ten years ago, Sweden was one of the countries in Europe with the lowest firearm related violence, so we have had quite a malign development with respect to that kind of violence in Sweden. No other country in Western Europe has at all the same level of problem which Sweden has, with respect to either firearm-related violence or explosive violence, that we can say with certainty,” explains Ardavan Khoshnood, criminologist and associate professor of Emergency Medicine at Lund University.\n\n“It makes my heart bleed, as a Swedish patriot, to see what Sweden has become, with respect to gang violence and gang criminality,” adds Khoshnood, who researches the medical, political and criminological aspects of violent crimes through meeting its victims.\n\nWhat is particularly concerning is the sharp rise in under-15-year-olds suspected of being involved in murder. The Swedish Prosecution Authority has documented a three-fold increase of murder related cases in this age group from 2023 to 2024.\n\n“We see that all the leaders in the gangs, they’re using children to commit murders, to detonate explosives,” Diamant Salihu, a journalist and author who has reported on the escalation in gang crime conflicts over the past decade, tells CNN Sport. “In some cases, we have children as young as nine years old that are carrying arms to help the older leaders in the gangs.”\n\nSalihu explains that the gang leaders systematically use children to commit serious crime is to avoid strict punishments in the judiciary system, since the maximum sentence for a serious crime committed by a person under 18 is usually four years in closed youth care.\n\nDennis Martinsson, legal expert in Criminal Law and researcher at the Swedish National Council for Crime Prevention, explains that a youth between 15-17 can, in rare cases, be sentenced to prison.\n\n“For very serious offenses—such as murder—the choice is usually between secure youth detention or prison. However, it is extremely rare for individuals this young to be sentenced to prison.”\n\nChildren under the age of 15 are not legally accountable in Sweden, meaning they cannot be prosecuted or convicted of any crime. Instead, they may be placed under social services interventions. This has prompted a proposed reform to lower the age of criminal responsibility to 14 for serious offenses.\n\nThe loopholes in the judiciary system, along with failure in integration, are reasons criminal gangs have gained a foothold in Sweden, Salihu suggests.\n\n“In our suburbs, we have experienced social issues, high unemployment, significantly higher child poverty rates, and low school performance—various factors of deprivation. Combined, these have created a perfect storm, where police presence has been lacking in areas with multiple open drug markets. Multiple conflicts emerged simultaneously”, Salihu explains and continues:\n\n“We’ve seen a lot of increased deadly shootings, but looking back over the past 10 years, very few of them have been solved. And that makes people in these very violent, affected areas feel that society doesn’t really care about their sons being killed. So we have a system and a society where we see people feel that it’s us and them.”\n\nWhile authorities couldn’t provide Uppsala specific statistics for gang related crime, residents and community leaders told CNN they’ve noted a significant increase in criminal activities among minors that have affected many aspects of their daily lives. “This escalation in violence, particularly in Uppsala and around Stockholm, got the effect that opposing teams simply didn’t dare to come to Uppsala, leading to Sirius having to cancel many youth matches that were to be played here,” Wirehag the pastor says.\n\nHe knows he’s taking a risk coming to the vulnerable area of Gottsunda every Saturday night.\n\n“My kids ask me, ‘Dad, do you really need to go to this place tonight? We know what’s happening there. We are afraid that something will happen to you.’ I always have mixed feelings when I get behind the wheel and drive to the suburbs on a Saturday night.”\n\nYet he rarely misses a Saturday. Through soccer, he is hoping to create a link in society that he feels is missing. This evening, he has a surprise for the boys. He’s also invited local police.\n\n“These young men often have a hostile attitude toward the police. Some have fled from a country where they have been badly treated by the police. Some are doing illegal acts and are chased by the police. And of course there are those who are experiencing prejudice from the police, just because they have a background different from Swedish, they have been extra monitored and classified as criminals. These boys have no trust in the police whatsoever. We want to give the police the opportunity to slowly but surely build a relationship and trust with these young men.”\n\nDespite Wirehag’s attempt to give the police officers in attendance this night a big welcome applause, the boys’ response is lukewarm, to say the least. But some are eager to find out whatever they can.\n\n“My friend is 15 and got arrested. What happens when you get taken to the (police) station?” a boy – himself 15 years old – asks community police officer Carina Neumann, who patiently answers all questions, taking him through the scenario of a minor being caught with drugs on them, before he politely thanks her for the conversation and joins the others on the pitch.\n\n“We have maintained a strong police presence in Gottsunda. There’s no denying that many conflicts have taken place here. There have been numerous shootings and bombings, and tensions still remain,” Neumann tells CNN.\n\n“Quite a few network criminals are currently behind bars, but the recruitment of young people continues. The situation has worsened significantly – violence has become more brutal, and people are being shot over smaller disputes,” she continues.\n\nThe project in Gottsunda is part of Sirius’ social initiative “Football without borders.” Aside from the Saturday night matches, the club arranges for the boys to watch pro games, both in Uppsala and other cities, and meet some of the elite-level players. One of those is Sweden’s U21 national team player Joakim Persson.\n\n“Gottsunda Night Football is for players and guys that have grown up in a place that’s maybe not the best place in Sweden,” Persson tells CNN Sport.\n\n“Night football really helps these young people by disrupting chaos they could otherwise create in society. There’s a lot of talk about respect here. It’s very important and I notice that it’s needed.”\n\nIn Uppsala’s Pentecostal Church, a partner in the night football initiative, before the boys rush up to him for autographs, Persson talks to them about his life as a professional soccer player.\n\n“My best tip is to never give up. There will be setbacks in everything you do,” he says to the attentive crowd. “If you want to succeed at something, you have to keep on going, and not let the circumstances make you give up.”\n\nAbudi has recently been selected for the Syrian under-20 national team and been invited to next year’s senior national team selection.\n\n“The night football has done its part,” he says. “It’s kept me away from everything one should stay away from. And it’s helped a lot of young people aside from myself. I think it should become a bigger deal in Sweden, that should be implemented in every city and municipality.”\n\nWhen CNN meets Wirehag for the second time, he is on a different soccer pitch. The pastor explains the short move – just over 400 yards away from the previous sports hall – which places us outside the district of Gottsunda.\n\n“I don’t feel safe there. Not the boys either. So we moved to this area.”\n\nWirehag explains that many of the gang leaders, who sometimes show up at the night soccer sessions and try to use them as recruiting grounds, have enemies outside of their territory and don’t roam outside of the relative safety of Gottsunda, where they mostly operate. That’s why the mere 400 yards or so make a huge difference.\n\n“We’ve seen good developments and bad developments. There are still a lot of explosions. There are still a lot of shootings. Some of the boys, they’re not with us today because they left the city or they have been recruited, of course, to different gangs.\n\n“But most of the boys, they’re still joining us every Saturday night. We need to show them that there is so much more in this society to live for, (things) worth fighting for. We cannot help everyone and prevent them from being recruited to gangs. But we can help someone, and that’s worth everything if it’s just for one single boy.\n\n“If I look back 10 years from now and see that we just saved one boy, it will be worth everything.”', '', 'Published 6:26 AM EDT, Tue April 15, 2025', 'why-soccer-might-be-swedens-way-out-of-a-gang-crime-crisis-1745809152'),

I think she has a couple more under her belt and she’s just incredible.”\n\nBiles has previously admitted that Andrade is the gymnast that “scares” her the most in competition and said the Brazilian’s talent has forced her to keep getting better.\n\nThat rivalry was there for all to witness in Paris and, according to Biles, it only served to advance women’s sport even further.\n\n“Women’s sports have done amazing in the past couple of years and I think it’s just the beginning for women’s sports as well,” she said.\n\n“I think we’re going to start gaining more and more respect and I think that’s exactly what we need.”\n\nIt’s still unclear whether the world has seen Biles competing at an Olympic Games for the last time.\n\nThe 28-year-old is yet to decide whether she will seek to participate in Los Angeles in 2028, but told Sports Illustrated earlier this year that competing in another Games would be “greedy.”\n\nMore recently, she told French sports outlet L’Equipe that she would need to be “excited” by the opportunity to compete if she was going to participate in Los Angeles.\n\nShe also noted concerns over her body’s ability to keep pushing at the top level, noting that her body “literally collapsed” after competing at Paris last year.\n\nNaturally, then, Biles has thought about what life after gymnastics could look like and told CNN Sports that she wouldn’t be against trying her hand at team ownership at some point.\n\n“Oh my gosh, I think that would be so much fun just because, again, to give back, to lead, to be a mentor, it would be really fun,” Biles said, when asked whether she would ever consider investing in a women’s sports team one day.\n\n“I think that’s super exciting, to push women’s sports forward, to gain ownership, and to just show how powerful we are on and off the courts, floors, whatever that sport is.”', 'Future of women’s sport', 'Updated 9:27 AM EDT, Wed April 23, 2025', 'simone-biles-says-gymnastics-rivalry-with-friend-rebeca-andrade-has-pushed-the-sport-forward-1745809152'),

He’s a battler,” Heaven explained. “He always gets his way around and he finds a way to win.\n\n“This time on Sunday, when he had the disappointment on the 13th hole, he pulled it back on the 15th hole, then he pulled it back on the 17th hole, and then he had to do it all again on the playoff. It was such an achievement that it’ll go down in history as one of the greatest Masters ever.”\n\nMcIlroy’s journey into golf has become part of local folklore, beginning as an avid fan of Tiger Woods and spending long hours on the driving range honing his skills from a young age.\n\nHeaven first encountered McIlroy when he was six years old and remembers he and Michael Bannon – another aspiring player and now McIlroy’s coach – hitting drives down the 17th hole at Holywood Golf Club.\n\n“All the other golfers used to be coming through the course, and they used to stop and watch, and they just couldn’t believe how good he was at that age, hitting the balls down the 17th hole,” Heaven remembers.\n\nMcIlroy was always surrounded by golf, Heaven explains, beginning with his grandfather Jimmy who was a member at Holywood.\n\nMcIlroy’s parents, Gerry and Rosie, went to great lengths to ensure that McIlroy could fulfill his full potential as a golfer, as Heaven paid tribute to their dedication for providing him with an opportunity to flourish.\n\n“When (McIlroy) was growing up as a young boy, Gerry and his mom, Rosie, they had many jobs to support Rory,” Heaven explained. “To support him on his career, to take him to all the tournaments, to travel all around Ireland so he could enter the tournaments.\n\n“And it was such a commitment by the parents, everyone in Holywood acknowledges that, that they went through hard times to make Rory turn up at all the tournaments.”\n\nAnd all the hard work and long hours have paid off with McIlroy cementing his name in the history books with his victory at this year’s Masters.\n\nWinning at Augusta National had become the one achievement that had remained elusive for McIlroy across his golfing career, but with that weight no longer on his back, Heaven believes he can go onto bigger and better things and surpass 10 major titles – he currently has five – now that the “shackles are off.”\n\n“I think it’s a free run over the next couple of years, and he’s so talented that when he turns up to all the golf tournaments, he’s always the favorite,” he said.\n\n“But Rory pushes through the ‘Rory-coaster.’ He makes us wait but the excitement, the humbleness of the guy, the professionalism of the guy, the homeboy of Holywood, it’s an unbelievable achievement that he’s done, and he’s now a global superstar.”', '‘The shackles are off now’', 'Published 5:00 AM EDT, Sat April 19, 2025', 'rory-mcilroy-could-go-onto-win-10-majors-now-masters-shackles-are-off-says-mens-captain-of-his-hometown-golf-club-1745809152'),

Its momentum slowed to a pause for a moment, and then – with one more revolution – it revealed the iconic Nike swoosh and dropped into the cup.\n\nThe roar from the patrons was deafening as Woods strode off the green, clinching his fourth Masters title shortly afterwards. The magnitude of the moment wasn’t lost on anyone who’d witnessed it as it instantly became one of the greatest highlights in the history of broadcast sports and is remembered as such 20 years later.\n\nBut we might never have seen it. The television viewers at home might only have heard it.\n\nLance Barrow had a ringside seat to the events of that day as the coordinating producer for CBS’s golf coverage of the 69th Masters Tournament.\n\n“I saw Tiger hit shots that no other human being possibly could,” he told CNN Sports, adding that this birdie attempt, a tricky chip shot from up against the second cut on the edge of the green, was likely the best golf shot that he was ever a part of.\n\n“You think about all the things that could have gone wrong and there’s only a few things that could have gone right,” he said. “There was a possibility that Tiger could knock it in a bunker or knock it in the water. He hit the shot, it went in the hole, and 20 years later, we’re still talking about it.”\n\nDescribing his role as the head coach of the broadcast team, Barrow sat in the front row of the operations room in the truck. Ahead of him was an array of some 200 screens, each offering a view from one of the many cameras on the course, a replay clip or a graphics package. To his right was the director Steve Milton and then the technical director Norm Patterson, the man who punched the buttons on the vision mixer.\n\nAs Woods paced back and forth on the green to assess his options for the shot, the tension was building. He was trailing Chris di Marco by a stroke, and he needed to pull off something special. Barrow says he wasn’t following the action on the main screen in front of him, the “on-air feed” that corresponds to what the viewers see at home.\n\n“If you start looking at the main monitor,” he explained, “you become a fan and you forget what you’re supposed to do. I’m not really watching, because I’m thinking what am I going to do next.”\n\nAs Barrow relives the moment, he recalls something that he and many of his peers were told by one of their mentors when they were starting out in the business: “There’s nothing more boring than a stationary ball.” And so, when it looked like the ball had stalled on the edge of the cup, director Milton called for a shot-change to a close-up of Woods, who was crouching by the side of the green in a state of agonized expectation.\n\n“When the ball went in,” said Barrow, “Replay producer Jim Rikhoff hits me in the shoulder as hard as I’ve ever been hit in my life, and he said, ‘That’s the greatest shot I’ve ever seen.’ And then I looked at Steve, and Steve goes, ‘I’m sorry, I missed it.’”\n\nBut it turns out, he hadn’t. Patterson had stayed with the shot and the whole world had, in fact, seen the ball drop.\n\n“For whatever reason, he didn’t punch it fast enough,” Barrow explained, “Maybe he knew something we didn’t see, maybe he was a little late hearing Steve, and we got arguably the greatest shot in major history.”\n\nIn that moment, nobody felt worse than Milton, who’d given the order to cut to the flank camera on the 16th green.\n\nSpeaking about it 15 years later to Golf.com, he said, “I looked at Norm and said, ‘Did we see it go in?’ He said, ‘Yes, I stayed with it. I stayed with the shot.’” Having breathed a sigh of relief, Milton thanked his colleague, who replied, “Steve, we’re a great team.”\n\nBarrow also produced NFL coverage for CBS, but he believes that golf is the hardest sport to cover on television. As he recounted the drama of that moment 20 years ago, he noted that it took him several minutes to describe something that was as fast as the snap of your fingers, highlighting the delicate hire-wire balancing act that live sports broadcast teams are constantly navigating.\n\n“Somebody asked me one time, ‘What keeps me up at night? What makes me nervous?’ I said, ‘Not this job.’ It’s live television, there’s nothing we can do. We’re walking this tightrope and at any moment, disaster could happen; you could miss a touchdown or a basket or a goal and we can’t sit around discussing it,” he said. “We have to make those decisions in a split second, you’ve got to have a short memory, and you’ve got to keep going.”\n\nBy capturing the full scope of the drama, though, they helped to cement Woods’ legacy as an icon of the game, and it surely helped secure an Emmy award for the CBS coverage. Barrow admits their tournament coverage probably wouldn’t even have been entered for consideration if they’d missed the ball dropping.\n\nBarrow has now retired, but Milton is still on the front line, directing CBS’s coverage of the 89th Masters. Sadly though, 2005 was Norm Patterson’s last Masters tournament – he died of a sudden heart attack just a few months later, at the age of 45.\n\nSpeaking to the San Diego Union-Tribune at the time, Barrow said, “This is a slap in the face. We’re like family, we spend so much time together.”\n\nIn 2020, Milton said, “I remember Norm every time I see that shot, it reminds me of him. It was his moment. He and Tiger created one of the most iconic moments in sports television history.”\n\nIt wasn’t a scene from a movie, but it could so easily have been. Nine years previously, Barrow had made a cameo appearance in the Kevin Costner blockbuster “Tin Cup.” Playing himself in a CBS broadcast truck, he had watched the fictional character Roy McAvoy attempt an audacious, high-risk, shot to win the US Open.\n\n“That shot was a defining moment, “McAvoy said to his caddie, “And when a defining moment comes along, you define the moment, or it defines you.”\n\nEverybody involved defined the moment at the 2005 Masters, and like a great movie, it seems to get better and better every time you watch it.', '', 'Updated 8:04 AM EDT, Sat April 12, 2025', 'tiger-woods-2005-masters-chipin-was-the-shot-heard-around-the-world-we-almost-didnt-see-it-1745809152'),

He\'d never play a down in the league.', 'The NFL draft is broadcast live on television every year as millions tune in and hundreds of thousands more attend in person to revel in the hoopla of it all.\n\nIt’s a far cry from the event’s humble beginnings, when the player picked first didn’t even know it was happening and soon walked away from the game without ever earning a cent.\n\nThere are no tackles or touchdowns, but the draft has become one of the biggest sports events of the year, because the fans know that a three-day event in April could impact the fortunes of their teams for years to come. Two-hundred-fifty-seven players will be drafted this week in Green Bay, Wisconsin, and anyone chosen in the first round – which begins at 8 p.m. ET on Thursday – will be set for life with guaranteed multi-million-dollar contracts. It was all very different in the first year of the draft back in 1936 when just 81 players were selected through nine rounds in the inaugural draft.\n\nThere was little doubt that University of Chicago halfback Jay Berwanger would go first that year. At 6-foot tall and 195 pounds, the standout player of his class had just received the first ever Heisman Trophy and been named as the Chicago Tribune’s Big 10 player of the year.\n\n“He played offense, defense and special teams for Chicago,” explained Landon Bundy, the school’s director of sports information and promotions, to CNN. “He pretty much never came off the field and he played every single position there was on defense.”\n\nBundy said that Berwanger was also the team’s kicker, so he’d often score a touchdown and then kick the extra point himself.\n\n“In his Heisman Trophy campaign, it looks like he passed for 405 yards and ran for 577 yards,” Bundy said. “He was the kickoff returner, and he scored six touchdowns, kicking five of the extra points. Basically, he did it all.”\n\n“You can say anything superlative about him and I’ll double it,” said his coach Clark Shaughnessy to the Chicago Tribune in 1935.\n\nAmong his many nicknames, Berwanger was known as “The Man in the Iron Mask,” a reference to the faceguard he wore to protect his twice-broken nose. For more reasons than one, he was hard to forget – the Chicago Tribune polled all the opposing players in Berwanger’s senior season and 104 of the 107 participants concluded that he was the best halfback they’d ever seen.\n\nEven Gerald Ford, a future president who won back-to-back national championships with Michigan, would attest to Berwanger’s brilliance and he carried a permanent scar under his left eye to prove it.\n\nThe New York Times quoted Ford in 2002, “When I tackled Jay one time, his heel hit my cheekbone and opened it up three inches,” he said. Ford has described Berwanger as “one of the greatest athletes I’ve known.”\n\nIn November 1935, the Downtown Athletic Club in New York recognized Berwanger’s impact on the college game by making him the inaugural recipient of a new trophy given to the “most valuable player east of the Mississippi.” The following year it was renamed after club’s late athletic director, John Heisman.\n\nOn hearing news of his accolade via a telegram, Berwanger didn’t quite know what to make of it. Speaking about the honor a half-century later he said that it wasn’t really a big deal at the time.\n\n“No one at school said anything to me about winning it other than a few congratulations. I was more excited about the trip (to New York) than the trophy because it was my first flight,” he said.\n\nIndeed, Berwanger didn’t have much use for the trophy once it was in his possession, which was described as being too wide for a mantlepiece and too large for a coffee table. According to the UChicago magazine, the stiff arm of the player depicted in the trophy spent many years propping the door open at his Aunt Gussie’s house.\n\nThree months later, the NFL held its first formalized draft and it was much different than the razzmatazz of the modern day. The Hartford Courant described it as “no gala, more like a penny-ante poker game. Nine cigar-puffing, mogul wannabees, some of whom were paying their players with IOUs, stubbornly trying to salvage their dream of professional football.”\n\nBerwanger told the Courant in 1994 that he was oblivious to the draft at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel in Philadelphia.\n\n“I found out I was drafted by reading it in the newspaper,” he said, “I didn’t even know the draft was going on.”\n\nPhiladelphia Eagles owner Bert Bell had persuaded his peers to formalize a draft in order to cease the expensive and “self-defeating” bidding wars for college players and he’d proposed that teams should choose players in reverse order from the previous season’s standings. That meant the worst team, Bell’s own 2-9 Eagles, went first and chose Berwanger, quickly dealing his rights to the Chicago Bears. The Eagles didn’t think they’d be able to afford Berwanger’s salary demands, and the Bears owner and coach George Halas soon realized he didn’t have enough money, either.\n\nAccording to the Courant, the two met in the lobby of a downtown hotel in Chicago.\n\n“He asked what I wanted,” Berwanger recalled, “and I had my tongue in my cheek. I told him, $25,000 for two years. He looked at my date and said, `Nice to have met you; have a nice time tonight.’ And that was the end of it.”\n\nAs Brian E Cooper, author of “First Heisman: The Life of Jay Berwanger” described it to UChicago Magazine, the player had made the Bears an offer they simply couldn’t accept.\n\n“Jay basically signaled to Halas, by making an extremely high salary ‘demand,’ that he wasn’t really that interested in pro football,” Cooper said.\n\nIn his obituary in 2002, the Los Angeles Times quoted Berwanger, who had said, “There was no money in pro football then, that was during the Great Depression. I thought I’d have a better future by using my education rather than my football skills.”\n\nHaving snubbed a career as a professional football player, Berwanger considered competing in the decathlon at the Berlin Olympics that summer, but he chose instead to finish his studies, and he went to work as a foam rubber-salesman. In World War Two, he rose to the rank of lieutenant commander as a Navy flight instructor, and after the war he founded a company that made plastic and sponge-rubber strips for cars and farm machinery. According to the New York Times, Jay Berwanger Inc. was grossing $30 million a year when he sold it in 1992.\n\nBerwanger isn’t the only player to be drafted first in the NFL and not play a game; tragically, the Heisman Trophy’s first black recipient, Ernie Davis, was picked first in 1962 but died of leukemia at the age of 23 and never played for the Cleveland Browns.\n\nAnd although Berwanger never played in the NFL, his name still carries a unique distinction within a league that would become the most lucrative in all of sport. He was the very first pick in the very first draft, but his timing was just a little off. Before his death at the age of 88 in 2002, Berwanger noted that if he’d been drafted even just a few years later, then he would surely have turned professional. And nobody can deny that he was an original.\n\n“I still think of myself as the first, kind of like being George Washington,” Berwanger once said.', '', 'Updated 7:49 AM EDT, Thu April 24, 2025', 'he-was-the-first-player-ever-to-be-drafted-in-the-nfl-but-he-never-played-a-professional-game-1745809152'),

But he does think it needs improving.\n\nFor Johnson and many others, we are reminded of the sport’s potential once every four years when, for a brief, two-week window, athletes compete for status and legacy at the Summer Olympic Games.\n\nIn that moment, track and field is suddenly the most popular show on the planet, the short-lived center of the sporting universe. It’s what happens over the next four years that the sprinter-turned-commissioner has concerns about.\n\n“That’s the void that has existed in the sport,” Johnson tells CNN Sports’ Amanda Davies, “and we’re filling it with Grand Slam Track.”\n\nSpearheaded by the four-time Olympic champion, Grand Slam Track hosts its inaugural event in Kingston, Jamaica on Friday – the first of four meets taking place across the next three months.\n\nThe league has attracted some of the biggest names in the sport, including American Olympic champions Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone, Gabby Thomas, Cole Hocker and Quincy Hall.\n\nAthletes signing up for Grand Slam Track have been promised regular, meaningful races against their fiercest rivals, as well as more prize money than the sport has ever offered before.\n\nThe 48 racers contracted by the league each receive an annual base salary for competing in the four meets over the course of the season, while $12.6 million in prize money is also on offer. That ranges from $100,000 for winning a slam to $10,000 for placing last.\n\nBy contrast, in the Diamond League – the sport’s established annual series of track and field meets – athletes receive $10,000 for winning an event and $1,000 for placing eighth.\n\n“Most of the athletes suffer greatly because they aren’t able to realize any value,” says Johnson, best remembered for winning 200-meter and 400-meter gold medals at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta.\n\n“Those athletes end up in situations where, many years later, and sometimes even in their careers, they’re wondering: ‘Should I have made this choice? I love this sport, but I’m suffering financially, I’m suffering mentally trying to make a living in this sport. I’m having to rely on friends and family to help.’”\n\nThe debut Grand Slam Track season will see 48 contracted racers, who are among the world’s top athletes, and 48 challengers, selected on an event-by-event basis, competing in six event groups: short and long sprints, short and long hurdles, and short and long distance.\n\nEach athlete is assigned to an event group and will compete in two disciplines at every meet. Short sprinters, for example, will race in the 100 and 200 meters, and long sprinters in the 200 and 400 meters.\n\nPoints are earned based on an athlete’s finishing position in a race, and whoever has the most points across the two races at a meet is crowned the winner of an event group.\n\n“That creates some significant narratives and jeopardy, which is what fans told us they want,” says Johnson. “They want to see the athletes more. They also want to see some jeopardy and some stakes.”\n\nWith the contracted racers guaranteed to appear at every event, Grand Slam Track hopes to showcase the sport’s top athletes more regularly, beyond the Olympics and the biennial World Athletics Championships. But there are significant absentees from the roster, including the likes of Sha’Carri Richardson, Jakob Ingebrigtsen, Karsten Warholm and Femke Bol.\n\nNotably, the two reigning Olympic 100m champions – Noah Lyles and Julien Alfred – have not signed up, and the league only features track – and not field – disciplines, meaning there is no place for superstar pole vaulter Mondo Duplantis.\n\nHowever, those who have joined are encouraged by the league’s approach, particularly when it comes to compensating athletes.\n\n“I’ve never had a base salary from a series of races before, that’s entirely novel,” American distance runner Grant Fisher tells CNN Sports. “For distance runners and for sprinters, pretty much anyone in track, your main source of income is from a shoe company – that’d be your main sponsor.\n\n“You might get an appearance fee at a race here and there, but unless you’re a superstar, you’re probably not getting money to show up places. Whereas with Grand Slam, you have an incentive to show up, and then you have a huge incentive to race well. The prize purse is unlike anything this sport has ever seen … It’s a massive shift.”\n\nFisher, a two-time Olympic bronze medalist who recently broke two indoor world records, will compete in the 3,000 and 5,000 meters – the long distance event group – as a contracted racer at this season’s four meets.\n\nHe won’t be up against all his big rivals, such as two-time Olympic champion Ingebrigtsen, but still feels that Grand Slam Track is the platform he needs to elevate his career.\n\n“I want to race the best guys as often as possible, and I want to be the best runner in the world,” says Fisher. “In order to have that title, I need to beat the best guys in the world consistently.\n\n“It’s a cool format, it’s new. It gives fans something to follow with continuity, and I’m excited to be part of it. When they approached me, probably not great negotiation tactics, but I was kind of already sold on joining … They really didn’t have to win me over too much.”\n\nThis season’s races will be broadcast in 189 countries and territories, with Peacock and The CW serving as broadcasters in the US, Eurosport in Europe and Asia, and TNT Sports in the UK and Ireland. Both Eurosport and TNT Sports are sister companies of CNN under the Warner Bros. Discovery umbrella.\n\nInside Kingston’s National Stadium, the track has already been painted in the green, yellow and black of Jamaica’s flag in anticipation of the league’s opening event. The next three meets will be in the US – Miami, Philadelphia and Los Angeles – which Johnson says will serve a huge market for track and field, though one with few elite races to show for it.\n\nThe 57-year-old insists that Grand Slam Track is not trying to usurp the likes of World Athletics, the sport’s global governing, and the Diamond League, which holds most of its events in Europe.\n\n“We’re a different product,” he says, adding that he has “a great relationship” with World Athletics and its president, Sebastian Coe. In turn, Coe has welcomed Johnson’s league, taking comfort in the “luster” and “investment” being injected into the sport.\n\nGrand Slam Track only has plans to grow and, according to Johnson, has been contacted by cities interested in hosting future meets. “This is a journey for us, and we’re in it for the long haul,” he says. “We’re not going anywhere.”\n\nFor athletes like Fisher, who faces the demanding prospect of racing two distance events in three days this week, Grand Slam Track will ostensibly feel the same as other races he has competed in, and his targets for the season-opener in Kingston are simple.\n\n“The only goal is to win,” he says. “If I can consistently win these Slams, then that’s a really good sign for where I am in my career.”', '', 'Updated 11:13 AM EDT, Thu April 3, 2025', 'with-some-athletes-suffering-financially-michael-johnson-hopes-his-new-league-can-bring-value-to-track-and-field-1745809152');

He’s got tremendous feel around the greens – but not in the way you might be thinking, and he’s usually about 15 under, but we’re not talking about his scorecard.\n\nThat’s because Jim Best is a diver who finds your lost golf balls and turns them into a lucrative business.\n\nAt one stage, he was working at 65 courses up the Eastern seaboard of the United States, salvaging up to two million balls a year. He’s since pared it back to less than a dozen courses, but TPC Sawgrass – site of the Players Championship – has always been his favorite, especially around the 17th hole and its iconic island green.\n\n“I get a lot of balls out of there,” he explains to CNN Sport, saying that annually he can salvage around 70,000 balls from that particular body of water alone. “I mean I go there, and I make money, like a harvesting a crop, like a field of corn.”\n\nIt’s a career that began almost by accident. While studying at the University of South Florida in 1993, he was cycling along a cart path when he spotted some lost balls in the woods. He found enough to fill his backpack, washed them in his sink and then sold them to the golf shop across the road from his apartment.\n\n“So that’s how I fed myself! I’m like, ‘Dude, I got dinner for the whole week in just a couple of hours!’”\n\nBest graduated and went to work in the cell tower business, but he kept hawking balls on the side, selling them wherever he happened to be working: “Every single body was interested in cheap product, so in ’98, I decided I wanted to give this a go.”\n\nHe got himself certified as a diver and entered into contracts with various golf courses for the exclusive rights to salvage their balls.\n\nAbove the waterline, the iconic 17th green of TPC Sawgrass looks idyllic, but it’s much less so beneath the surface. Best says the murky water can be full of tannins and algae and, once he’s started reaching for balls on the bottom, the disturbed silt reduces visibility dramatically. Fortunately, he knows the topography at the bottom just as well as the golfers can read their putts above him on the grass.\n\n“Once you do it a few times, your mind sees it without seeing it. It’s anywhere from six to 15 feet deep and maybe 20 feet in the middle, and there’s little hills and stuff like that,” he tells CNN.\n\nHe’ll bring a couple of oxygen tanks to each dive and spend between five and six hours in the water, sometimes bagging as many as 6,000 balls around the 17th alone. “But you never get them all, ever,” he says. “I don’t care how good you are.”\n\nBalls that are missed are unlikely to be of much use when they are eventually recovered. Best says that around 10% of his recovery gets trashed because the water permeates the membrane of the ball, causing the gases inside to expand.\n\nOnce he’s dived every single body of water on a course, he’ll return to his warehouse to wash and sort the balls by make, model and quality. Everything will then be sold – unless he’s stumbled across a famous ball.\n\nIn 2005, around the time that Tiger Woods won the fourth of his five Masters titles, Best found one of his balls at TPC Sawgrass. “It was elation,” he recalls of his emotions when he saw the markings denoting the player many consider to be the greatest of all time.\n\nGracing his collection is another of Tiger’s golf balls, found at Doral, one from Rory McIlroy – marked RORS – a couple from Phil Mickelson, and balls that he believes once belonged to Tom Brady and Peyton Manning. Arguably his most treasured find, though, is a Titleist Pro V 1x marked with the number 45.\n\n“I’ve got President Trump’s ball; it’s marked Donald J. Trump in red letters, I don’t know how that gets eclipsed,” Best says. “I mean, you may not like President Trump, but it’s just the fact that there’s only one of him.”\n\nA watery grave for your golf ball is an Aladdin’s Cave for Best. Along with the thousands of balls he’s able to recycle, he’s also stumbled across cellphones, cameras, sunglasses, sunhats and even putters. “I’ve gotten five or six Scotty Cameron putters,” he beams. “They’re just flung out there!”\n\nWhile he can’t be sure exactly how some of the other items found their way into the water, it’s a safe bet that the clubs were tossed in a fit of anger. “It’s just a bit of rage,” he posits, “and then I’m sure it’s a bit of remorse when they get to the clubhouse!”\n\nBased on where in the water he retrieves the balls, Best estimates that most players only just miss the green, and he’s had more than a few close shaves of his own. “A few years ago, there was an 11-foot and a nine-foot alligator around the green where I was diving. I worked as long as I felt OK and they were staying at bay; if they got too curious, I got out.”\n\nHowever, while diving at other courses, he hasn’t been so fortunate. He says he’s been bitten on the ankle by a “four-footer.”\n\n“I was 18 (feet) under when he grabbed me. Their teeth are very, very sharp, especially the little ones, like a Doberman Pinscher with sharper teeth and a stronger bite.”\n\nOn another occasion, he says that an alligator “bum rushed” into his oxygen tank and “busted his mouth up.” But his biggest “Oh crap” moment came in 2007 at Florida’s Innisbrook Golf Resort, when he says a 14-foot alligator raised its body out of the water on the Island Course and began growling, with its body reverberating and water flying off its back.\n\nBest’s dive buddy Pascal was diving underwater, oblivious to the danger. “Totally the (most scared) I’ve been in my life,” he says, “The hardest thing I had to do was get back in the water and get my guy out. I almost didn’t do it, but I was like, ‘Either I’m a real man or I’m not.’”\n\nSo, the next time somebody’s tee shot splashes into the water at 17 at Sawgrass, remember this: while it might signal the end of a player’s challenge for the tournament, it’s likely just the beginning of a whole new adventure for that little ball and the man who might find it.', '', 'Updated 12:26 PM EDT, Tue March 11, 2025', 'the-scuba-diver-who-fights-alligators-and-murky-waters-to-rescue-your-golf-balls-1745809152'),

And being mentally tough, right? You know, you talk about the fans – they don’t have no time for the mentally weak,” Hamilton said.\n\n“Just knowing from the day-to-day, I mean, look at the weather, where in April it snows sometimes. You gotta be mentally tough for situations like that. And when I do look at the team, yes, it does remind me of the past.”\n\nThe Pistons play the New York Knicks in Game 3 of their best-of-seven first round series at 7 p.m. ET on Thursday on TNT. The series returns to the Motor City with the Pistons having ended one of the longest playoff victory droughts in sports, winning the second game of the series in New York to end a 15-game playoff losing streak that spanned 17 years.\n\nHamilton was on the 2007-08 team that lost to the Boston Celtics in the Eastern Conference Finals, the last chapter in the most successful period in franchise history. While those great Pistons teams never had a player with the talent level of someone like Cade Cunningham, the fourth-year star who has become one of the best players in the NBA this season, Hamilton said there are a lot of similarities in how ownership and the front office built the team.\n\n“They understood what the city embodies. They understood the success that we had in the past and how we did, how we do things there,” Hamilton said, emphasizing that the Pistons have built through the draft with younger players and then added pieces like Tobas Harris, Dennis Schröder and Tim Hardaway Jr. to be important veteran voices on the team.\n\nAfter the long run of playoff futility following that loss in the 2008 conference finals – the Pistons only made the playoffs three times in the ensuing years and were swept in each of those series – a new generation of basketball fans in the Motor City is getting to experience success for the first time. It’s coming just a year after the franchise’s worst season in history, a 14-68 stinker that included a 28-game losing streak that tied the single-season record.\n\nHamilton, who still works as a consultant for the Pistons in addition to his entrepreneurial work and being a full-time dad to his three children, said fans can expect the players to be inspired by the people they play for, as his teammates – like Chauncey Billups, Ben Wallace, Rasheed Wallace and Tayshaun Prince – were.\n\n“The thing that was special for me, and I can speak probably for the rest of guys, is we embodied the city,” he told CNN Sports. “We came to work every day. We had our hard hat or Timberland boots or overalls, and we were coming to work, right? And the city respected that, the way we did it. We did it together, we did it as one.\n\n“We played 100% each and every night, and the fans came and supported us and yelled and screamed, regardless if it was up by 20 or down by 20.\n\n“It wasn’t a situation where you go to certain cities that the team is not playing well, the fans boo you. That’s not what Detroit did. The fans understood that if it ain’t rough, it ain’t right, and that was our motto, too.”\n\nThe Pistons are taking on a New York team that is heavily favored in the series and has the weight of expectations on its shoulders. After ending their own lackluster period, the Knicks have been to the playoffs three out of the last four years – but haven’t yet advanced past the second round.\n\nThis year is supposed to be different, thanks to the additions of Karl-Anthony Towns and Mikal Bridges to the team alongside superstar guard Jalen Brunson. It’s possible that the weight of those expectations might be weighing on the Knicks, though.\n\nThe Pistons have looked the better team throughout much of the series, and if not for a blistering New York comeback and Detroit’s collapse in the fourth quarter of Game 1, the Knicks might be heading to Little Caesars Arena in Detroit trailing in the series.\n\nInstead, it’s a 1-1 series and the youthful Pistons – the fourth-youngest playoff team with an average age of 25.8 – are looking to feed off a home crowd that was once the envy of the league during Hamilton’s heyday.\n\nOne thing that makes Hamilton envious of the modern Pistons is the location of the team’s home base. When Hamilton and his teammates were the cream of the NBA crop, they played at the Palace of Auburn Hills, about an hour’s drive north of downtown. Hamilton and fellow Pistons legend Billups would often talk about wanting to play one or two games a year in the city, just to get the vibe of being in the heart of Detroit.\n\nNow, when he comes back, Hamilton likes to take an electric scooter and ride around the city to marvel at all the changes that have happened over the last two decades since he first arrived in southeast Michigan. He is treated like family at local restaurants and other establishments when he walks in.\n\n“We played in Auburn Hills, so we spent most of our time in the suburbs out there, and we didn’t spend a whole lot of time in the heart of the city where you get to grit, and you get to grind, and you really get to feel the true essence of Detroit,” he said.\n\n“So, when I’m riding around there, I’m super amazed just at the development. The people there are so gracious. They’re so sweet. As I’m going around, I’m saying hello to fans and hanging out at local restaurants and local bars, and I’m just pulling up like it’s like ‘Cheers’ pretty much.\n\n“That’s what the city is because the fans and the community have always put their hands around their athletes or their people that support the community.”', '', 'Published 10:00 AM EDT, Thu April 24, 2025', 'the-detroit-pistons-are-shaking-off-a-decade-in-the-doldrums-a-franchise-legend-sees-reminders-of-his-era-in-this-new-team-1745809152'),

For anyone interested in more than just the golf at Augusta National, the answer might seem obvious.\n\nWith all the flowering azalea bushes and dogwood trees in the background, springtime in Georgia is simply the best time to showcase the tournament and the stunning property upon which it is played. The dazzling array of pinks, purples, and fuchsias that are always so resplendent at that time of year have become almost as alluring as the action on the course.\n\nHowever, the reason that arguably golf’s most prestigious tournament is played every April has nothing to do with the botany and instead everything to do with a completely different sport: Baseball.\n\nWhen Bobby Jones completed the seemingly impossible grand slam of golf in 1930, winning all four major tournaments in a single calendar year, he retired from the game at the age of 28.\n\nBut there would be much more to his legacy. The Atlanta native then partnered with stockbroker Clifford Roberts to purchase the grounds of the Fruitland Nurseries company from the Berckman family in Augusta, 150 miles to the east of his hometown.\n\nJones thought the property already looked like a golf course and construction began in 1931, with the 18 holes ready for play at the end of 1932. Now, they needed a tournament to showcase the course to the world.\n\nAt the time, golf’s four major tournaments were considered to be the US Open, the US Amateur, The Open Championship and the British Amateur. Jones and Roberts had grand plans for their “Augusta National Invitation Tournament” – the only question was when to schedule it.\n\nAs a newcomer to the game, the organizers knew that their tournament couldn’t succeed without publicity. The all-star field wouldn’t be enough; they needed sports journalists to come to Augusta and write about it.\n\nIn the 1930s, when the NBA and the NFL were still decades away from realization, baseball was America’s pre-eminent sport, and in the springtime, the country’s top sportswriters would be traveling back from covering Spring Training in Florida to their headquarters in the Northeast.\n\nSo, Augusta National scheduled it then, hiring nationally syndicated writer Grantland Rice, who then persuaded many of his peers to stop by in Augusta. Since there was a two-to three-week gap between Spring Training and the start of the Major League Baseball season, those writers were only too happy with the diversion in Georgia.\n\nIn addition to covering a tournament featuring a who’s who of golf, Bobby Jones’ comeback from retirement was reason enough to attend. The Pittsburgh Post Gazette carried the Associated Press’ reporting that Jones was the co-favorite, playing on his own course where he’d set the practice-round record of 65.\n\n“The great Georgian quits handshaking for some earnest club swinging in the first round of the $5,000 masters invitation tournament,” read the copy filed the day before the tournament teed off on March 22.\n\nJones’ comeback, though, was short-lived; he finished outside the money, 10 strokes behind inaugural champion Horton Smith, but the writers were now hooked.\n\nAt the time, there was a passing mention of the “beautiful Augusta National course,” while Rice remarked that, although the final round was played with a “chilly wind under a gray heavy sky,” it was a “truly great course.”\n\nIt would be another quarter of a century before anyone outside Augusta really noticed the majestic backdrop to the tournament. Sports Illustrated was the first media outlet to use full color photography in print, and the magazine didn’t feature the Masters on the cover until 1960.\n\nThe explosion of color television across the country came a little over half a decade later, by which time the Masters had cemented its status as one of the four major tournaments, the first in the calendar year and the only one to be played on the same course every 12 months.\n\nThe springtime schedule has remained and, with the exception of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, The Masters has been played in April – either partially or wholly – ever since the second tournament was held in 1935.\n\nThe spectacular scenery has become an intrinsic part of its charm; in fact, 2017 green jacket winner Sergio Garcia even named his daughter Azalea.\n\nSo, if it wasn’t for baseball, the Masters might never have taken off, and if it wasn’t played in the springtime, it would look like a completely different tournament altogether.', '', 'Published 8:00 AM EDT, Thu April 10, 2025', 'why-americas-pastime-caused-the-masters-to-be-played-in-april-1745809152'),

I wish they didn’t say it!”\n\nMcIlroy’s nickname is Rors, he writes it in all capital letters on every golf ball that he tees up, and the roar that burst from his chest when he sunk the winning putt on Sunday was primal.\n\n“There wasn’t much joy in that reaction,” he said. “It was all relief. It was a decade plus of pent-up emotion that came out of me.”\n\nThe patrons who witnessed the tidal wave of feelings that swept McIlroy off his feet on the 18th green knew exactly why he was so overcome; they could understand why his body was on its knees, heaving and convulsing.\n\nThe Masters is the only major tournament that is played on the same golf course every year, and many of the spectators here on Sunday would have witnessed his epic meltdown in 2011, when McIlroy blew a seemingly comfortable third-round lead.\n\nHis collapse was so monumental that he went from leading the tournament as he made the turn on Sunday, to limping home in a tie for 15th place.\n\nBy the time he made it back to the clubhouse, the expectant throng had deserted him, the journalists who walked with McIlroy every step of the way that day have described the experience as funereal.\n\nHe’s spent the 14 years since that day trying to redeem himself, and the last 11 years trying to join the titans of the game – Gene Sarazen, Ben Hogan, Player, Nicklaus and Woods as the only men to win all four major tournaments in the modern era and complete the career slam.\n\nThose patrons knew and understood McIlroy’s journey and the psychological trauma he’s since endured, and he knew that every year that passed him by would only make it harder to finally succeed.\n\nWhen asked by CNN Sports if he could travel back in time to that 2011 evening to speak to himself, what he would see and what he would say, he paused to formulate both his thoughts and his emotions.\n\n“I would see a young man that didn’t really know a whole lot about the world,” he said. “A young man with a lot of learning to do and a lot of growing up to do. In 2011, I didn’t understand why I got myself in a great position and I didn’t understand why I let it slip.\n\n“I would say to him, ‘Just stay the course, just keep believing.’ And I would say that to any young girl or boy that’s listening to this. I’ve literally made my dreams come true today, and I would say, ‘Believe in your dreams, and if you work hard enough and put the effort in, you can achieve anything you want.’”\n\nBut the story of Sunday was about so much more than just the historical accomplishment.\n\nIt was over four hours of nerve-wracking drama and one of the most extraordinary sporting events witnessed in recent times.\n\nMcIlroy admits that he was initially overwhelmed by the moment. He said that he was “unbelievably nervous” in the morning, that his legs felt like jelly on the first tee, he had a knot in his stomach and his appetite had deserted him to the point that he had to force his food down.\n\nHis emotional state manifested itself with a disastrous start, as his two-shot lead evaporated immediately with a double bogey.\n\nAt any other point in his recent career, this could have been a terminal setback, but he said that he felt the early mistake actually calmed him. But there were further moments of madness, another double bogey on 13 seemed like it might derail him completely.\n\nEven his playing partner Bryson DeChambeau, who began the day in contention himself, said that he wanted to cry for McIlroy when his ball plunged into Rae’s Creek.\n\nSeveral times during the afternoon, McIlroy demonstrably crumpled under the intolerable weight of expectation, and he sometimes looked to be on the verge of tears.\n\nAnd yet, he kept bouncing back, defying anybody who lost faith and gave up on him, producing a series of audacious career-defining shots to stay in the fight.\n\n“My battle today was with myself,” he said. “It wasn’t with anyone else.”\n\nBut even when it seemed as though he’d weathered his own internal tempest, another misstep on the 72nd hole threatened to sink him for good.\n\nHis Ryder Cup teammate Justin Rose had been quietly tearing up the course with six birdies on the second nine, storming back into contention from seven shots behind, meaning that McIlroy had to now navigate a nervy playoff.\n\nBut once again, he recovered his composure, sinking a birdie putt on the first extra hole to win his most elusive tournament, cementing his place in the history books and completing one of the most emotional and extraordinary narrative arcs in all of sports.\n\nSarazen, Hogan and Woods had completed the grand slam at their first opportunity, Nicklaus and Player at their third, but McIlroy had suffered through a decade of trying before finally making it at the 11th attempt. Not only that, he also became the first player in Masters history to win the green jacket after making four double bogeys during the span of the tournament.\n\nSome sportswriters had previewed the day by saying that it would be the most terrifying round of golf in his life, and by the end of it, he couldn’t deny it.\n\n“It was one of my toughest days I’ve ever had on the golf course,” he concurred. “I didn’t make it easy today, I certainly didn’t make it easy. There was points I thought, ‘Have I let this slip again?’ But I responded with clutch shots when I needed to and I’m really proud of myself for that. It’s been an emotionally draining week, a lot of rollercoaster rounds, and so just, you know, absolutely thrilled to be the last man standing.”\n\nAs one writer quipped to CNN, McIlroy’s demons had simply run out of holes – because, clearly, he still has mental challenges to wrestle with. But however he had managed it, “Rors” has finally triumphed to join a club so exclusive that nobody even thought to mention the $4.2 million prize.\n\nIt’s a shame that the history books won’t be able detail the emotional chaos of the last five hours of his odyssey to ascend to the pantheon of greats because it truly was one of the most titanic days in sports.\n\nWho knows what we’ll talk about at the Masters next year, but that will surely be hard to beat!', '', 'Published 8:00 AM EDT, Mon April 14, 2025', 'what-are-we-going-to-talk-about-next-year-why-rory-mcilroys-masters-mania-will-be-hard-to-beat-1745809152'),

McIlroy becomes just the sixth player to accomplish the feat joining Gene Sarazen, Ben Hogan, Gary Player, Jack Nicklaus and Tiger Woods.\n\nMcIlroy defeated the Englishman Rose in a redo of hole 18 after sinking a four-foot putt to birdie and securing the historic victory.\n\nImmediate emotion fell over McIlroy, tossing his putter and hat in the air and letting out a huge scream just before falling to his knees as the crowd on hand cheered him on.\n\nMcIlroy then met up with his wife Erica Stoll and his daughter, Poppy, to continue the celebration.\n\nThe now five-time major champion, still emotional, told the CBS broadcast that the feeling of finally overcoming the drought is an “incredible” feeling.\n\n“This is my 17th time here and I started to wonder if it would ever be my time, and I think the last ten coming here, with the burden of the grand slam on my shoulders, and trying to achieve that. I’m sort of wondering what we’re going to talk about going into next year’s Masters,” McIlroy said.\n\n“But I’m just absolutely honored and thrilled, and just so proud to be able to call myself a Masters champion.”\n\nMcIlroy’s pursuit of history got off to a rocky start on Sunday with a double bogey on the first hole at Augusta National.\n\nAfter his playing partner Bryson DeChambeau birdied the second hole, McIlroy suddenly found himself a shot behind after beginning the day two strokes ahead.\n\nBut McIlroy kept his wits about him, and as DeChambeau faltered on the ensuing holes, McIlroy carded birdies on the third and fourth holes to regain a three-stroke lead.\n\nMcIlroy ran off a streak of pars after that, but as Justin Rose and Ludvig Åberg attempted to make a run up the leaderboard, the 2022 Masters runner-up again put his foot on the gas.\n\nA pair of birdies on the ninth and 10th holes kept the challengers at a comfortable distance.\n\nBut the road got more and more bumpy at the turn into the back nine.\n\nAfter hitting a shot into the Rae’s Creek on 13th hole for a double bogey and another bogey on the 14th let Rose take over the lead at 11-under temporarily.\n\nNow at 10-under par and in a tie for second with Åberg, McIlroy would birdie two of the next three holes including on hole 17 to take the lead right back, leading Rose by one-stroke entering the 18th hole.\n\nAfter a shot from the fairway landed in a bunker, McIlroy recovered by setting up a five-foot putt to secure the major win.\n\nHowever, McIlroy would miss the putt to force the playoff.\n\nDespite needing a playoff to win, McIlroy thought he did a “good job bouncing back” from both double bogeys.\n\n“I was really nervous going out. It was almost as if the double bogey at the first calmed my nerves a little bit, and sort of got me into it in a funny way,” McIlroy said.\n\n“I just think all week I responded to setbacks. I think that’s what I’ll take from this week. And you know couldn’t be more proud of myself for that and being able to bounce back when I needed to.”\n\nThe Northern Irishman first made his presence felt at Augusta in 2011 at the age of just 21. McIlroy took a four-shot lead to Sunday that year, before collapsing on in the final round with an eight-over round of 80 and finishing the tournament tied for 15th place.\n\nMcIlroy’s path toward golf history began later that year, when he won his first major at the US Open. A year later, he lifted the Wanamaker Trophy as winner of the PGA Championship in 2012 at age 23.\n\nBy the end of the 2014 season, a 25-year-old McIlroy had won the Open Championship and added another PGA Championship title.\n\nA grand slam-capping Masters victory felt imminent and inevitable.\n\nBut McIlroy’s torrid pace at the majors slowed as years passed without adding another grand slam championship.\n\nThe Northern Irishman kept on winning during that time, but the major trophies continued to elude him.\n\nCurrently the second-ranked golfer in the world, McIlroy has ended the season in the Official World Golf Rankings’ top 10 every year since 2009. He also logged seven top-10 finishes at the Masters in that span.\n\nIn 2022, a year after missing the cut at Augusta, McIlroy had his closest brush with a Masters win. He rode a blistering final round 64 to a second place finish that year, finishing just behind champion Scottie Scheffler.\n\nThe 11-year drought between major championships that McIlroy ended Sunday matches the longest gap between major wins for any player in golf history.\n\nGolf fans were spoiled this week at the 89th playing of the Masters.\n\nGood weather, great play on the course and history gave fans all they can ask.\n\nRose has now finished runner-up in golf’s most prized tournament three times, previously in 2015 and 2017.\n\nEven with his third time being a runner-up at the tournament, Rose found solace in how he played.\n\n“Some of the golf I’ve played this week has been probably the finest of my career, tee-to-green, and even on the greens at times. … But I woke up this morning, just really grateful to be Sunday of Augusta. It’s a special day in the game of golf no matter what, and really wanted to go and put a good account on myself and felt like I got off to a strong start,” Rose said to reporters.\n\n“Then something happened, for sure, around the middle of round. I just kind of went into the place that you dream about going to. I felt so good with my game. Felt so good with my mind. I began to sense that I was playing my way into the tournament. I was laser focused out there.\n\n“And unfortunately, the playoff, they always end so quickly. You know, that’s sudden death. You don’t really get an opportunity. If you’re not the guy to hit the great shot or hole the great putt, it’s over. So I felt like, that’s the nature of sudden death. But not really anything I could have done more today.”\n\nLIV Golf’s Patrick Reed finished third at 9-under and reigning Masters champion Scottie Scheffler in fourth place at 8-under par, failing to become to the first back-to-back winner since Woods did so in 2001 and 2002.\n\nDespite coming into the day on McIlroy’s tail for the lead, DeChambeau tumbled down the leaderboard after a rough outing on Masters Sunday.\n\nThe 31-year-old finished 3-over 75 to finish tied for fifth with Im Sung-jae at 7-under.\n\nDeChambeau criticized his “iron play” as the reason for the poor round but remained positive for the future.\n\n“It would have been a lot different outcome.

In between those strikes, Bruno Fernandes almost scored a spectacular volley from Dalot’s long pass, his shot thumping off the crossbar.\n\nEverything appeared to be playing into United’s hands as the match wore on, but with 20 minutes of normal time remaining, Corentin Tolisso’s header hauled Lyon back into the contest. That was soon followed by Nicolás Tagliafico’s equalizer, which saw United’s lead evaporate in the space of six minutes.\n\nWith extra time looming, Lyon’s chances of progressing were dented when Tolisso was sent off for a second yellow card, but that did little to quell the French side’s ambition.\n\nRayan Cherki’s strike from the edge of the area in the 104th minute gave the 10 men an advantage before Alexandre Lacazette’s penalty early in the second half of extra time added a fourth goal for Lyon without response from United.\n\nCue one of the most memorable comebacks in European football. Fernandes’ penalty made it 4-3 on the night and 6-5 on aggregate, while Kobbie Mainoo’s neat finish in the 120th minute sparked pandemonium inside Old Trafford.\n\nThe United fans inside the stadium – those who hadn’t given up hope and headed for an early exit – would have been overjoyed to see the game go to penalties. But the comeback wasn’t finished there. Up stepped Harry Maguire – the central defender being deployed as a makeshift striker – to head the ball into the net in the first minute of stoppage time, an unlikely hero for an improbable victory.\n\nAccording to Opta, United is the first team to score two goals in the 120th minute of a major European match, which also marked the first time that five goals have been scored in extra time.\n\n“I think that is why we like this sport so much,” United manager Ruben Amorim told reporters. “All the frustration that a coach has in this season, the bad moments – when you have moments like this, it is all worth it.”\n\nDefender Leny Yoro, meanwhile, told TNT Sports that he “(couldn’t) understand what happened,” adding: “We gave everything and thanks to God we won this game … That was crazy.”\n\nUnited will travel to northern Spain for the first semifinal leg against Athletic Bilbao on May 1, while Premier League rival Tottenham, which defeated Germany’s Eintracht Frankfurt 1-0 on Thursday, will host Bodø/Glimt – the surprise package of this season’s Europa League – in the other semifinal.\n\nThe Norwegian champion entered its quarterfinal tie against Italian side Lazio as a heavy underdog, but was well-placed to reach the final four after a 2-0 win at home in last week’s first leg.\n\nLazio piled on the pressure in Rome’s Stadio Olimpico, reducing the deficit through Valentín Castellanos’ first-half goal before Tijjani Noslin bundled in a dramatic equalizer in the 93rd minute to send the match to extra time. Moments earlier, Andreas Helmersen had missed a glorious chance to seal victory for the visitors.\n\nBoulaye Dia scored Lazio’s third with a close-range header to take the lead for the first time in the tie, but Bodø/Glimt, which faced 33 shots over the course of the game, found a response through Helmersen in the 109th minute.\n\nThe substitute was later sent off for a second yellow card, though the game was destined for a penalty shootout at that point.\n\nAnd with Lazio failing to convert three of its five penalties, Bodø/Glimt became the first Norwegian team to reach the semifinals of a European competition – a remarkable achievement for the town of just 55,000 people located inside the Arctic Circle.\n\n“It’s huge. We’re very happy,” said goalkeeper Nikita Haikin, who made two saves in the shootout. “It’s historic, not only for Bodø/Glimt but for all of Norwegian football.\n\n“I was angry after the missed chances, but you know that it’s part and parcel of football and that’s why we love it.”', 'Bodø/Glimt shocks Lazio', 'Updated 7:02 AM EDT, Fri April 18, 2025', 'manchester-united-pulls-off-miracle-comeback-to-reach-europa-league-semifinals-in-historic-fashion-1745809152'),

They’ve even gone so far as questioning squad members’ commitment to the US badge.\n\nDempsey recognizes his critiques come with an asterisk; the last time he played for the USMNT was a nightmare 2-1 loss to Trinidad and Tobago that resulted in the US failing to qualify for a World Cup for the first time since 1986.\n\n“I’ve been a part of failures. I mean, 2018, we didn’t qualify for the World Cup. It was a huge failure. It was a huge step backwards in the wrong direction, and all you can do is what the players did.”\n\nThat failure triggered the influx of many of today’s squad with only Christian Pulisic and Tim Ream remaining from the team that was humbled at the hands of the Caribbean nation.\n\nIt was that wave of new talent and fresh faces that left some fans calling them “The Baby Eagles.”\n\nThe team now boasts a plethora of players who ply their trade at European clubs and who experienced the round of 16 at the 2022 World Cup together.\n\n“They fought hard. They qualified for the World Cup (in Qatar). They performed well in the last World Cup, got out of the group, and it looked like a team that was starting to build towards something. But since that World Cup, it looks like we’ve kind of taken another step back.\n\n“There’s been players who are doing really well in Europe. You got Antonee Robinson at Fulham, who’s having a great season. You have Christian Pulisic, AC Milan, who’s having a great season. You have players like Tyler Adams and Weston McKennie.\n\n“I want people to fight for each other. I want there to be competition for spots in the team and maybe things need to be shaken up a little bit in terms of who that starting 11 needs to be,” he tells CNN.\n\nWhile household names abound, the USMNT’s historically deep squad no longer exists and a quick fix is difficult.\n\n“I think when you look back at the history of US men’s national team, you normally had a goalie that was playing consistently week in and week out in Europe, whether it was Brad Friedel, Kasey Keller or Tim Howard. That’s not the case for us at the moment.\n\n“(Also) when you think back, we had a number 9 that was solidified (at) that position and could score goals. We don’t really have that in our team at the moment.”\n\nWhile the Texas native hasn’t been afraid to voice his concerns, he does, however, push back on the idea that Pulisic’s captaincy is one of the problems. The AC Milan winger has increasingly faced scrutiny that he may not be the right type of leader for the Stars and Stripes.\n\nFormer manager Gregg Berhalter preferred to rotate the captain’s armband among a leadership group – something that came under scrutiny as performances dipped before his dismissal. And despite Pulisic’s “Captain America” nickname, Tyler Adams was ultimately named captain for the 2022 Qatar World Cup.\n\nDempsey, however, sees the merits in multiple locker-room leaders: “I think the team is not just one person who is a leader. I think there’s multiple people on that team that are leaders.”\n\nHe compares the current debate to his experiences at the 2014 Brazil World Cup, saying, “Tim Howard was on that team, and even though I was a captain, I saw him as one of the captains. He was one of the leaders as well, so it takes more than one captain to kind of step up and get everybody on track.”\n\nDespite lethargic performances against the likes of Panama, Canada and traditional rival Mexico, Dempsey believes the biggest problem facing the USMNT in the run-up to the 2026 World Cup is its strength of schedule.\n\n“I mean, Copa América, that’s a big competition… and no disrespect to the CONCACAF Nations League, but it’s kind of a new tournament that’s been made up in the last few years.\n\n“I think the Nations League is kind of hurt. Around the world in terms of even, you know, the European Nations League, it’s just the same teams playing each other over and over again. So (for) me as a fan, I think there would be more excitement around seeing other teams.”\n\nNo need to start panicking yet, though, USMNT fans. Despite the laundry list of concerns – mentality and passion, Pochettino’s potentially wandering eye, a lack of an elite goalkeeper and center forward, and the strength of opponents – Dempsey is adamant “it’s not all doom and gloom.”\n\n“There’s quality in the side; it’s just getting the best out of them. And when your back’s against the wall, just kind of fighting for each other.”', 'Fighting for the badge', 'Updated 9:32 AM EDT, Fri April 18, 2025', 'stars-stripes-and-unfulfilled-potential-clint-dempseys-concerns-over-the-usmnt-heading-into-its-home-world-cup-1745809152'),

The world No. 6 recently said he believes it was a simple mistake that led to Sinner testing positive.\n\n“I think ­Jannik is a really, really genuine, nice person. And on top of that, he’s obviously an unbelievable player,” Draper told BBC Sport and The Guardian in a joint interview at this year’s Madrid Open.\n\n“In this situa­tion, I’m sure that he would have ­absolutely zero idea of anything. That’s just the way life goes – sometimes, there’s mistakes.”\n\nSinner will be eligible to play at the Italian Open next month, with the tournament starting on May 7, three days after his ban ends.\n\nBut his return to the locker room might be met with a mixed reaction, with not everyone satisfied with the way Sinner’s case was handled.\n\nThe 23-year-old’s ban, for example, meant he didn’t miss a single grand slam event and raised concerns in the sport.\n\nNotably, Novak Djokovic said that the whole case was “not a good image for our sport” and suggested that many players believe there “is favoritism happening” in regards to anti-doping.\n\nMeanwhile, British player Liam Broady told BBC Sport that it felt like the suspension was intended to “impact Jannik’s career as little as possible.”\n\nSerena Williams also said she would have been banned for “20 years” and “gotten grand slams taken away” if the same thing had happened to her. She did, though, describe Sinner as a “fantastic personality” and “great for the sport.”\n\nAn ITIA spokesperson previously told CNN Sports that it approaches each case in the same way, “irrespective of a player’s ranking or status.”\n\nIn a February statement, Sinner said that he has “always accepted that I am responsible for my team and realize WADA’s strict rules are an important protection for the sport I love.”\n\nAnd, for Draper, his relationship with Sinner has not been changed by the controversy which has seemingly divided the tennis world.\n\n“In terms of actually how I feel about him as a person, I think it’s important for people to know and recognize that the guy’s very, very kind-hearted and a good human being,” Draper added. “So he doesn’t deserve any of the hate that he gets.”\n\nSinner won this year’s Australian Open and will be looking to win his first French Open title as the clay court season gets underway.\n\nDraper and Sinner have practiced together in recent weeks, with the childhood friends meeting up in Monte Carlo as the Italian prepares for his return to the court.\n\nThe British star told BBC Sport and The Guardian that he didn’t speak much about the doping ban with Sinner, instead opting to focus on the tennis.\n\n“He’s obviously had a bit of time off, but he’s playing at an incredible level still,” Draper said.\n\n“I’m looking forward to having him back on the tour because I think his presence has been missed.

After he broke me, I got more into the match and played my tennis. The first set was a big battle, it was super important to win it and gain the momentum. I’m so proud of myself.”\n\nAlcaraz entered the final as the heavy favorite, having established himself as one of tennis’ most dominant clay court players and having beaten defending champion Casper Ruud in the quarterfinals.\n\nThe match was the first tour-level final between two players aged 21-or-under since 2022 and it was Rune who fell behind early on.\n\nHe was quickly broken by Alcaraz, playing in front of a partisan crowd, but rallied impressively to fight his way back into the match.\n\nRune won eight consecutive points to go from being a break down to moving ahead. He had two set points but Alcaraz was able to repel them in brilliant fashion.\n\nAnd having gone to a tie break, it was Rune who came out on top in the first, with Alcaraz hitting his 10th forehand unforced error of the set.\n\n“When I got broken in the first set, I thought to myself that I don’t need to hit every shot on the line,” Rune said afterwards. “So I (asked) myself: ‘What did Novak (Djokovic) do when he beat him?’ I played it in my mind, the Olympics final, and tried to play that style, making a lot of balls. I’m very happy with how I stayed composed when it mattered, and I was really brave.”\n\nIn the second set, Alcaraz took an off-court medical timeout in the third game – twice taking treatment during the match for an ailment on his right leg – and couldn’t regain his rhythm against a pumped-up Rune.\n\nRune saved all four of the break points against him in the second set as the Danish player didn’t drop another game to emphatically claim the Barcelona Open title.\n\nWith the result, Rune returns to the top 10 of the men’s world rankings.', '', 'Published 6:04 AM EDT, Mon April 21, 2025', 'holger-rune-stuns-carlos-alcaraz-to-win-barcelona-open-and-end-twoyear-trophy-drought-1745809152');
